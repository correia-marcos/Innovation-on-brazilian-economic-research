Students of innovation policy and policymakers have increasingly focused on procurement
policy as an alternative for enhancing innovative effort and providing an adequate
environment for interactions between innovative firms and organizations. This paper aims to
assess the effect of procurement policy performed by Petrobras under the local content policy
in the oil and gas sector. Using microdata from RAIS, the paper compares the performance of
oil and gas equipment supplies firms with a control sample built through the use of propensity
score matching sampling. The results suggest that being a supplier to the oil and gas sector
improves firm’s innovative effort. The paper estimates that Petrobras suppliers’ ratio of
technological personnel to total number of employees is 2.5 percentage points above the
control sample. This result suggests that policy has been successful and further attention
should be directed towards demand instruments.

1. INTRODUCTION

For many years, scholars and policymakers have downplayed the role of demand in innovative
settings. As a consequence, innovative policy has mostly been directed towards correcting
market imperfections on the supply side. Innovative instruments such as public subsidies to
innovation, tax credits and public financing have been the main channels used by policymakers
(Edquist and Hommen 2000, Edler and Georghiou 2007 and Guerzoni and Raiteri 2015).
Whenever applied, demand side policies have remained as a hidden agenda and their results
have very rarely been put under spotlight. However, in these cases, governmental agencies
and state companies have acted as coordinators of a network of suppliers (Block 2008 and
Mazzucato 2011).

Petrobras, the Brazilian state-owned oil company (SOC), has since its birth been a state
instrument for the development of downstream and upstream firms. Though Cardoso’s
administration (1995-2002) reduced Petrobras’ focus on supplier development and the
importance of Petrobras’ demand to domestic industrial companies, during Lula’s two terms,
the resurgence of quality control programs and of domestic suppliers’ development programs
was coupled with a national content policy that increasingly established national content
goals.

It is clear that this shift in public policy may have had consequences in firms’ conduct.
Assessment of the results of this shift in policy seems to be an interesting agenda. Previous
work on this thematic has focused on the impact over growth and exports (IPEA 2011) and on
the sources of innovative behavior (De Oliveira and Rocha 2008 and Rocha 2015). Nonetheless,
little light has been thrown on the impact national content policy has had on innovative effort.

This paper aims to assess the effect of demand oriented policy performed by Petrobras under
the national content goals established by Agência Nacional do Petróleo (ANP). The paper uses
microdata from Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS). The paper creates a quasi-
experimental setting building a counterfactual sample through propensity score matching.
After forming the control sample, we run Schumpeterian based models to assess the impact of
procurement policy on innovation efforts.

The paper is organized in six sections, including this introduction. Section two presents an
analytical framework based on previous literature on the subject and defines the contribution
of this paper. Section three describes the national content policy in the oil and gas sector and
the instruments Petrobras has designed to cope with the task of domestic acquisition of
materials and services. Section four describes the database and presents the methodology
used in the paper. Section five presents the results and section six shows the conclusions.

2. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

Two different views usually motivate innovative policies. On the one hand, there are those
who understand policies should be designed to correct for market imperfections; on the other
hand, there are those that seek governmental intervention as builders of networks. The first
perception is generally focused on correcting market imperfections, such as uncertainty or lack
of appropriablity. Proposed mechanisms are typically the structuring of property rights
instruments and the correction of market prices under the effect of externalities. In this case,
resources may be channeled through the financing of R&D activities, the building of financial
mechanisms and institutions, such as venture capital funds, the supply of non-reimbursable
funds or the implementation of subsidies and tax exemptions for innovative activities.

The second perception emphasizes the interactive character of innovative activities and
stresses the importance of structuring innovative networks. Emphasis is directed towards the
interaction between different set of actors such as universities, research institutions, small and
large firms. Supply and demand tend to be linked.

One should thus distinguish between direct and indirect innovation policies (Edquist, Hommen
and Tsipouri 2000). In the first case, policy instruments pursue the enhancement of innovative
activities through general changes in institutional framework, in the second case, instruments
aim to cultivate interaction. In the latter setting, public organizations are directly involved in
pursuing and building interaction.

Three factors have however been responsible for overshadowing government procurement.
First, the demand-pull-technology-push debate of the 80’s downplayed the importance of
demand and emphasized the protagonism of supply factors in innovative settings (Dosi 1982,
Scherer 1982). Second, demand policies suffered resistance from those opposed to picking the
winner policies. Third, WTO agreements imposed restrictions to such policies, leading
governments either to cease them (European Union) or to build a hidden agenda (USA) (Edler
and Georghiou 2007, Mazzucato 2011).

Empirical evidence has however favored government procurement policies. Litchenberg (1987)
tested the effect of federally financed R&D on R&D expenditures. However, whenever he
introduced controls for sales derived from government procurement, the sign of the effect of
federal finance to R&D variable on R&D expenditures became insignificant and the real effect
on company R&D expenditures was found to be on the sales to government procurement. This
conclusion is clearly associated with increases in future revenues and therefore with the
potential of public procurement to positively affect R&D expenditures. Lichtenberg (1988)
used a sample of 165 companies, controlling for industry characteristics and time variables, to
test whether competitive or non-competitive government procurement affect company R&D
expenditures. He concludes for a positive effect of government procurement, much larger than
other policy instruments. Geroski (1990) also finds evidence for the good performance of
public procurement. Guerzoni and Raiteri (2015) control for possible interaction between a
diversity of supply policy and demand policy instruments, arriving to a similar conclusion as
Litchenberg that whenever controlled for demand policy instruments, supply policy tend to
reduce its effectiveness and that demand policy instruments remains relevant.

Most importantly, there have been a number of recent studies that have renewed the interest
in procurement policy due to the possibility of interaction between agents that procurement
may iprovide (Mazzucato 2011, Block 2008 and Edler and Georghiou 2007). More specifically,
Block (2008) argues that the US has kept hidden a developmental State that has implemented
a series of successful interventions. According to his research, the results are unchallenged and
a large number of the main innovations in the US have followed projects that were funded by
governmental agencies.

Guerzoni and Raitieri (2015) define public procurement innovation policy as the one where a
public agency places and order products that do not exist at the time, but could be delivered if
interaction with the public agency takes place. In the Brazilian context, nonetheless, one
should consider that it not necessarily involves novelty to the international market, but in the
domestic market context where these firms carry out their activities. More adequately, Edquist
and Hommen (2000) list a set of instruments that may be present in these settings and that
enhance innovative efforts. First, innovation procurement policies may provide early
sophisticated demand for domestic firms. This means that new services and products that
would not be otherwise demanded or that would only be demanded through exports may find
a new demand in the public sector. Second, procurement may set stringent patterns and
benchmarking for domestic firms. Quality control may be implemented. Third, procurement
policy may encourage domestic firms “to act as 'lead users' in setting leading-edge standards
for domestic producers” (Edquist and Hommen p. 62) and therefore contribute to
international competitiveness of domestic industry. Fourth, and maybe most importantly,
procurement policy should facilitate innovation and should emphasize the complementary
strengths of firms in different positions of the product chain and seek the coordination of their
actions, stimulating the establishment of linkages and flows of knowledge amongst firms and
other organizations. Fifth, it should stimulate competition. Competitive dynamics is important
to offer the tensions needed for innovation inducement and for a health network of innovative
actors.

3. NATIONAL CONTENT POLICY IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR IN BRAZIL

The employment of a national content policy for the oil and gas sector under Lula’s
government represented a major step towards the establishing of a public procurement policy.
National content clauses were present in oil and gas exploration and production contracts
since the first bidding round that took place in 1999 (president Cardoso’s second term). The
main purpose of local content requirements were “to allow locally established goods and
service providers to participate in the oil and gas supply chain and increase their market share
in a competitive basis” (ANP 2012).1 However, until the fourth round, the clause expressed
preference to domestic suppliers, but did not include any particular national content target.
Rounds five and six contracts, that took place in 2003 and 2004, first established minimum
percentages based on whether blocks were located onshore, offshore shallow water or
offshore deep water. In 2005, authorities established a methodology to measure local content.
In 2007, minimum and maximum local content levels were imposed per equipment. This
regulation still holds up to today. Regulation became stricter as time went by. Moreover,
monitoring became tighter and ANP played an increasing role in this matter.2 More
importantly, local content began to play a central role in oil and gas policy in Brazil and the
fulfillment of these requirements became a central concern for policy makers, oil companies
and major suppliers.

In order to measure national content, authorities developed a rule book to be followed by oil
and gas suppliers from the 7th round on. This rule books submits to certification every item and
sub item acquired by oil and gas companies and their EPCs in exploration and production
activities. This trend towards stricter local content requirements has been criticized and later
on we should deal with it.

Petrobras, the Brazilian NOC, is the main oil operator in Brazil, producing around 90% of total
oil. Up to 2013, it held the third largest R&D budget amongst the world’s oil and gas operators
1
  Procurement policy does not distinguish locally established multinational affiliates from domestic
capital firms.
2
 Regulation ANP no. 9/2007 establishes the frequency, the format and the content of local investments
reports made with exploration and production development activities
and had the largest R&D to sales ratio (Rocha 2015). Petrobras acts in almost every stage of
the oil and gas production chain, such as exploration, production, refining and transportation.
Most importantly, Petrobras’ activities in exploration and production involve the development
of new technology to achieve deep water and ultra-deep water oil production, being also the
only company that operates in pre-salt conditions. These features is important to settle that
Petrobras operates in challenging and innovative conditions.

One important issue about the general use of local content policies in Brazil is whether
Petrobras has been able to positively influence suppliers’ learning and knowledge
accumulation process. IPEA (2011) tried to provide an answer to this question. They show that,
on average, Petrobras’s suppliers are larger, have a larger percentage of scientific personnel,
engineers, greater wages and better education. Therefore, Petrobras’ suppliers are amongst
the most qualified firms in the Brazilian economy. So, one important question would be
whether Petrobras adds value to its suppliers. De Negri et al. (2011) use propensity score
matching techniques to define a control group with respect to a set of characteristics.
Analyzing the treated sample (Petrobras suppliers) against the control sample, they find that
Petrobras’ procurement has positive and continued effect on firm growth, labor force
education level and wages (which may be an indicator for productivity). They however find a
negative impact on exports. Though there is no test run by De Negri et al. (2011), one may
speculate that this negative effect may be result of the redirecting of resources towards the
greater opportunities provided by Petrobras.

It is true that Petrobras chooses better firms. A supplier certificate (CRCC) that authorizes
departments to acquire goods or services has to be issued. Apart from formalities associated
with the legal status of firms, Petrobras requires social responsibility, environmental and
health certifications (respectively, ETHOS, ISO 14001 and ISO 18001). If the supplier provides
critical products, product quality certification (ISO 9001) is required. It is well known that very
often firms enhance their market value when they obtain CRCC from Petrobras.3 Nonetheless,
firms that become Petrobras’ suppliers have their overall costs increased in order to cope with
the requirements of the certifications. This has been stressed by some of the suppliers. They
tell that they leave one type of market that takes price as the most important variable and
enter another market where quality has an important role (also Oliveira and Rocha 2008).



3
 Oliveira and Rocha (2008) tell an anecdote that illustrates this case. One firm had its property structure changed.
There were two partners. One of them left the partnership to open one company in the same line of business. The
certificate was negotiated as the main part of the deal. Another case was related to an affiliate of a multinational
enterprise
However, Petrobras also acts to improve suppliers’ product quality. Quality control may be
divided into two main procedures: the technical audits for suppliers (ATF) and the Quality
Guarantee Program for Services and Materials (PGMQSA). The ATF is composed of inspections
that may be more or less intensive during production and delivery of the product, according to
the supplier qualification as classified by the Procurement Department. Usually the intensity of
audit is associated with the product line. Suppliers complain a lot about audit procedures
saying that they increase their costs. However, they agree that some of the required
procedures make their products better.

The PGQMSA has long run targets. The program consists of inspection visits to investigate the
application of the state of art techniques of production. The planning of the program requires
a complete investigation of the state of the art of technology in all covered product lines. After
the inspection, each firm receives a grade and this is used by project managers in the choice of
companies that will participate of their vendor list. Though some suppliers have lost their
certification after implementation, the main objective of the program is to increase the
compliance of state of the art norms and procedures in order to reduce the number of
unconformities in product delivery.

The program has achieved its goal and the number of unconformities has radically decreased
with the number of unconformities of PGQMSA covered products per US$ billion of
investment approaching zero (see Rocha 2015). Moreover, the inspections at the PGQMSA
served as a consultancy for the companies. Most of them improved their processes during the
program. This has been detected by Petrobras’ officials in their yearly inspections. One
example of the type of impact is the introduction of engineering departments in valve
producers in order to be able to calculate and store the signature of produced valves (Oliveira
and Rocha 2008).

Petrobras has also a program for the development of new suppliers or the development of
new products by existing suppliers. This program is undertaken by the procurement
department of Petrobras but may have explicit involvement of internal R&D personnel and its
intention is transference of knowledge required to have to product produced under the
adequate conditions. The development of new products together with suppliers is at the
center of Petrobras’ success in deep waters. One striking case is the subsea equipment that
made it possible for Petrobras to achieve its level of production.

There is however one important shortcoming in the relationship of Petrobras with most
suppliers located in Brazil. Very rarely knowledge flows go in both ways in a purposeful
manner. Mostly Petrobras is directing knowledge to its domestic suppliers. This characteristic
makes evident the problems associated with innovative capabilities in the domestic supplying
industry. Though suppliers were very likely to acknowledge the importance of Petrobras as
source of knowledge, they very rarely pointed out situations where they contributed to
innovative gains by Petrobras. Some exceptions occurred in some independent engineering
companies and in subsea equipment.

In recent years, multinational oil and gas service and equipment supplies companies have
established R&D labs in the Technological Park of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,
where the main Petrobras R&D lab, CENPES, is also located: Schlumberger, Baker-Hughes,
Halliburton, FMC, Tenaris-Confab, Siemens, General Electrics, Vallourec and Georadar.4

Rocha and Urraca Ruiz (2011) analyze the R&D internationalization strategies of three of these
MNC, Schlumberger, Baker-Hughes, and FMC, using patent data and interviews to their CEOs
in Brazil and to the CENPES CEO. They argue that three main features have attracted these
companies’ R&D investments to Brazil:

      (i)      the size of the pre-salt oil and gas province,
      (ii)     Petrobras’ accumulated capabilities and
      (iii)    the existence of qualified personnel.
Furthermore, the Petrobras network has also impact on cooperation. Fioravante and Aguirre
(2013) show that Petrobras’ suppliers are more likely to cooperate with universities and public
research labs than a control sample. Rocha and Bueno (2008) show, using Brazilian Innovation
Survey for 2003, that oil and gas suppliers have strong innovative behavior when compared to
other Manufacturing and Mining companies in Brazil. Nonetheless, they have lower R&D
expenditures. They then explain this behavior due to the larger cooperative relations oil and
gas suppliers establish with their clients (Petrobras) and outside industry agents, such as
universities.

This narrative shows that Petrobras has a procurement policy that follows most of the
instruments or directions proposed by Edquist and Hommen (2000). They provide market for
new products, allow firms to supply products in international technological frontier, improve
quality patterns and networking across different actors. The main shortcoming seems to be its
relation with competitive environments. As De Negri et al. (2011) have shown, firms that
supply to Petrobras become less likely to export. This is confirmed by Rocha (2011) in the

examination of the quality control program participants. Petrobras seems to absorb their
suppliers in their own operations.

4. DATABASE AND METHOD

       4.1. THE DATABASE

The paper uses microdata from Reação Annual de Informações Sociais5 (RAIS) for the years
2009, 2010 and 2011. RAIS is an administrative register that very employer has to file every
year in the Ministry of Labor. It contains social information on employees, such as number of
months in workplace, schooling, occupation, date of birth, gender, wage, among other
variables. Aggregating this information per firm provides accurate information on the firm
level. After aggregating, the whole database contains 2.2 million firms, in 2009, 2.4, in 2010,
and 2.5, in 2011.

In order to capture innovative effort, the paper uses a variable represented by the number of
employees dedicated to scientific and technical activities (PoTec), selected from the Brazilian
Occupation Classification, according to criteria elaborated by Araújo, Cavalcante and Alves
(2009). PoTec has a very high correlation to R&D expenditures as declared by firms to the
Brazilian Innovation Survey (from 0.8 to 0.9 depending on the year tested) and may therefore
be used as a proxy for technological activities. In 2011, RAIS registered 573902 scientific and
technical employees or 1.2% of total employees.

Previous experience indicates that the attempt to obtain the vendor list of oil and gas supplies
companies may conduct to frustration. Therefore, we will use a list of suppliers through the
Organização Nacional da Indústria do Petróleo (ONIP), which is an independent non-profit
private organization that gathers companies that supply to oil and gas industry. It has cadastral
information of the main players in the industry for the year 2007.

In 2011, there were 1150 ONIP listed firms in RAIS, 522 were in mining and manufacturing, 126
in construction, two in agriculture, and the remaining in services. Services firms were
concentrated in division 74 of ISIC 3, that is, Other Business Activities (205). However, ONIP’s
list does not by sure meet Petrobras’ vendor list. So, in order to control for mistake, the paper
only examines firms that supply critical equipment and inputs, that is that belong to the
following ISIC3 divisions: 11 - Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas, 27 - Manufacture
of basic metals, 28 - Manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and

accounting and computing machinery, 31 - Manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus

Manufacture of medical, precision and optical instruments, watches and clocks, 34 -
Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers, 35 - Manufacture of other transport equipment, 36 -
Manufacture of furniture; manufacturing n.e.c. These sectors gathered 441 supply companies
(according to 2011 RAIS), mostly small and medium sized (see Figure 1).

    4.2. THE METHOD

One important issue to tackle when evaluating governmental innovative policies is selection
biases. The aim of government support for innovative activities is to increase innovative
activities. Therefore, governmental programs should not fund activities that would happen
anyway, but focus on activities that would not occur if governmental funding was not available
(Wallsten 2000). In the former case, governmental support would be substitute for private
initiatives, while in the latter case it would be complementary.

Selection biases occur first because governmental officials would be inclined to choose firms
that they are sure would present results, and therefore focus would be directed to firms that
are more likely to carry out innovative activities. A second type of selection bias would emerge
from the behavior of innovative firms. In this case, firms would look for the cheapest way to
perform innovative activities.
In the case of oil and gas suppliers, the high level of requirements to become a Petrobras
supplier may result in similar problems and may have as a consequence biased results, that is,
Petrobras suppliers may be better firms because Petrobras selects the best firms in the market
and not because Petrobras has influence in their performance.

This kind of problem is tackled in Table 1 that presents descriptive statistics on a set of
selected variables for the universe of firms located in critical equipment suppliers’
manufacturing sectors – number of employees (nemp), number of employees in scientific and
technical occupations (potec), the potec to nemp ratio (inttec), the ratio of number of
employees with complete high school education to total employees (capacity), the ratio of the
number of employees with superior education to total employees (sup) and wage in terms of
the Brazilian minimum wage (wage). It seems clear that equipment suppliers are better firms.

Different authors have given different answers to the problem of selection bias. Wallsten
(2000) uses a three stages least square model with instrumental variable to tackle the
endogeneity problem. Gelabert, Fosfuri and Tribó (2009) follows Wallsten (2000) in the use of
instrumental variables and adds fixed effects panel as an instrument for controlling for firm
specific characteristics. Almus and Czarnitzki (2002) uses propensity score matching. Following
Almus and Czarnitzki, a number of studies have introduced propensity score matching to
control for selection biases (González and Pazó 2008, Goerg and Strobl 2007, Czarnitzki, Hanel
and Rosa 2011).

This paper will adopt propensity score matching in order to compose a control sample and to
deal with for selection biases. After composing the control sample, we will run two different
models, in a pooled data sample: (i) ordinary least squares and (ii) a tobit model. In this case,
we expect to deal with the question whether oil and gas suppliers, submitted to procurement
policy, outperform their counterpart.

In order to build a control model, we run a propensity score model that takes into account a
number of firm characteristics. The probit pooled model has as dependent variable
technological intensity, a dummy variable that assumes value 1 (one) if the firm is an oil and
gas supplier and 0 (zero), otherwise, and as independent variables, the concentration level of
the three digit sector where the firm is classified, represented by the Hirschman-Herfindhal
index (hhi), the firm’s wage level (wage), the proportion of employees with complete
secondary education (capacity), the average number of years of the employees in the firm
(experience), seven size dummies that account for the size level6, and sectoral dummies for the
two digit secotrs (see equation 1). The results are reported in 0. Most importanty, Table 3
shows that differences between treated and untreated samples with respect to size, sector
and the other variables are insignificant and, thus, the following analysis will deal with firms
that had similar probabilities of being treated.

  The use of size dummies is justified by the avoidance of testing a quadratic relation between the
dependent variable (intec=potec/nemp) and the independent variable that would represent size
(nemp).

We’ll report the results for the OLS model in pooled data and panel data random effects model
and for tobit model, also in pooled data and panel data random effects model. The use of tobit
model is justified due to the censured dependent variable in zero and one. Equation (2)
departs from the basic Schumpeterian model, relating innovation efforts to firm size and
market concentration. The use of sectoral dummies is justified to control for opportunity and
appropriability characteristics. Firm characteristics are also accounted for in experience and
capacity variables. Petro is the policy variable to be tested.
5. RESULTS

Table 4 shows the four regression equations. The first model presents an OLS pooled data
regression; the second, a panel data random effects regression; the third, a tobit pooled data
regression; and the fourth model, a random effects tobit panel data regression. In all four
equations, the respective F and Wald test present adequate values. In both random effects,
Breusch-Pagan test rejects the null hypothesis and suggest for the suitable use of random
effects.

The results of all four equations confirm both Schumpeterian hypotheses. On the one hand, all
size dummies, from ten employees on, present positive and significant coefficients. The
coefficient becomes larger as size increases suggesting larger firms dispend greater efforts in
technological activities. On the other hand, concentration has a positive and significant effect
on technology intensity. The higher the three-digit market concentration is, the higher the
technological efforts. Experience and capacity have the expected sign and improve
technological efforts. Most sectoral dummies are significant with higher effects in instruments
(33), electrical equipment (32) and oil and gas extraction (11).

The petro dummy has the expected sign. Relation with oil and gas procurement policy has
positive effect on technological effort, always significant at the 1% level. The dimension of the
effect varies from 0.9 percentage point, in the OLS model up to 2.5% percentage points in the
random effects tobit panel data model. In the case of both tobit models the effect is
substantial, suggesting that oil and gas procurement policy has been quite effective. The
analysis of the four models and the adequacy of the tobit model to the situation, suggests that
the impact should be closer to 2%. This impact is far from small. It more than doubles the
technological efforts in relation to similar firms in size, capacity, experience, markets and
sectors.

The results point to a great influence of Petrobras’ procurement on firm behavior. This
influence had been assessed before with respect to firm growth and exports (De Negri et al.
2011) with mixed results. This analysis adds important feature to it because it shows that
technological activities are also affected.

However, the result also throws some doubts on the way innovation policy has been carried
out in Brazil. Though Petrobras has been able to develop a thick and high performance
networks of firms, universities and research labs, the results seem to be much more a
consequence of the company’s initiative than a result of governmental policy. As Rocha (2015)
argues, only very recently resources from the supply side have been channeled towards the oil
and gas equipment supplies firms. From the great amount of public resources directed to R&D
and S&T activities in the oil and gas sector, very little has been focused on suppliers. Money
has mostly been directed towards CENPES (the Petrobras R&D lab) and universities and non-
profit research facilities. A greater connection between demand and supply instruments may
be called for and seems to be an important challenge to pursue.

Most importantly, in a scenario where Petrobras, national content policy and state-owned
companies are under great attack, this result points to important spillovers of the presence of
Petrobras and the role of policy guided measures carried out by the company.




6. CONCLUSIONS

This paper aimed to assess the impact on firms of the simultaneous application of a national
content clause in the oil and gas sector and the procurement policy carried out by Petrobras.
Using data from RAIS, the paper carried out this task by comparing the ratio of scientific and
technical personnel to total number of employees of oil and gas equipment supplies firms and
a control sample built through propensity score matching. The results suggest that being a
supplier to the sector improves firm’s technological intensity.

Recent literature on innovation policy has argued that procurement policies that explore more
interactions across agents are an important policy option. They pose that supply based policies
are based on a market imperfection view of innovation while procurement policies explore the
interactive character of innovative activities and, together with demand instruments, may
provide better results. This paper presents support to their cause.
