This paper presents empirical evidence from the Brazilian experience for the analysis on
securitization transactions and credit risk. Based on panel data framework that takes into
account 60 financial institutions from December 2002 to October 2012, we observe if
there is some effect of the securitization transactions on credit risk and also whether
credit risk stimulates securitization. Our findings indicate that securitization transactions
imply an increase in the credit risk whereas credit risk is not relevant to explain
securitization in Brazil.

Este artigo apresenta evidências empíricas da experiência brasileira a partir da análise
das operações de securitização e risco de crédito. Por meio da aplicação da metodologia
de dados em painel, que leva em conta 60 instituições financeiras entre dezembro de
2002 e outubro de 2012, observamos se há algum efeito das operações de securitização
sobre o risco de crédito e também se o risco de crédito estimula a securitização de
ativos. Os resultados indicam que as operações de securitização implicam um aumento
do risco de crédito, enquanto o risco de crédito não é relevante para explicar a
securitização no Brasil.

1. Introduction


       With the objective of increasing liquidity in the financial systems, financial
innovations proliferated. Among financial innovations there was a rapid development of
credit risk transfer markets. In particular, structured finance allows different classes of
assets being regrouped and their risk dispersed among different agents. As identified by
Affinito and Tagliaferri (2010), it is possible to identify four main determinants in
deciding to securitize bank loans: the need for new sources of funding, the transfer of
credit riskiness, the search for new profit opportunities, and the role of capital.
       The idea that the development of credit derivatives contributed to the stability of
the banking system was well accepted before the subprime crisis (Duffie, 2008). After
the subprime crisis the perception that credit derivatives are beneficial for the financial
system is doubtful. Some authors such as Uhde and Michalak (2010) found evidence
that credit risk transfer operations weaken the stability of the financial system. This
result can be connected with the possibility that transfer of credit risk can reduce the
monitoring of borrowers by the financial institutions (Keys et al, 2010). In contrast,
according to Dionne and Harchaoui (2003), in the case of securitization of assets,
financial institutions transfer only good quality credit in order to obtain high credit
ratings.
       In short, there is no clear evidence regarding the effect of securitization
transactions on the risk in the financial system. This literature is incipient for emerging
economies and, in particular, for Latin American countries. A possible justification for
this fact can be a lack of a developed financial system in these countries. However,
since 1999, Brazilian economy is marked by a macroeconomic stability which
contributes to the development of financial markets (see World Economic Forum,
2011). A good example is that the Central Bank of Brazil, through resolution n. 2,907 of
2001, created the receivables investment fund (FIDC) and opened a new capital market
alternative. As a result, the issuance volume of FDIC is not negligible (see figure 1) and
the domestic market represented 45% of the volume of securitization of Latin America
in 2012 (Moody’s, 2012). Therefore, analysis on securitization of receivables in Brazil
allows one to extract some empirical evidence.
       This paper makes a contribution to the empirical literature on securitization
transactions and credit risk through empirical evidence from the Brazilian experience.

Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and dynamic panel data framework (Difference
Generalized Method of Moments - D-GMM and System Generalized Method of
Moments - S-GMM) that draws on 60 financial institutions from December 2002 to
October 2012, our analysis is divided into two parts. First part of the empirical analysis
assesses the effect of the securitization transactions on credit risk. Second part evaluates
the determinants of securitization. Special attention is given to checking whether credit
risk stimulates securitization transactions. Our findings indicate that securitization
transactions imply an increase in the credit risk. On the other hand credit risk is not
relevant to explain securitization transactions in Brazil.

       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes data and variables as well
as the empirical model and methodology. Section 3 presents estimation results for the
credit risk focusing the analysis on the effect caused by securitization operations.
Section 4 presents a robustness analysis through estimation of determinants of the
securitization transactions. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Methodology and data


       Due to the fact that the main objective of this study is to provide empirical
evidence regarding securitization and credit risk, a first point to be considered is the
information of these main variables in the empirical model. Hence, with the intention of
gathering data on securitization in Brazil, we have identified all Credit Rights
Investment Funds (FIDC - Fundos de Investimento em Direitos Creditórios) in the
period from December 2002 to October 2012 through information available from
Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil (CVM). During this period there were
594 operations of FIDC, however 213 of them were exempted from registration in
CVM. As a consequence, due to the difficulty in finding information on those
operations and also due to the fact that their volume is negligible, they have been
dropped from the sample. Moreover, since the focus of the study is on the financial
market, 253 operations from non-financial institutions are also excluded from the
sample. Hence the initial sample corresponds to 128 FIDC issuances by 32 financial
institutions (80% which are multiple banks).
       With the objective of improving the analysis regarding the impact caused by
securitization of assets, the final sample included another 28 financial institutions with
the same profile (small or medium size taking into account the total assets) but which
did not utilize securitization. In other words, the inclusion of the financial institutions
that did not used securitization, but that have similar characteristics of those that used
securitization, is important because it eliminates the risk of bias selection in the sample
(the list of financial institutions used in the sample is available in table 1).
       In the same way as Bannier and Hänsel (2008), we use dummy variables for
observing differences between securitizing and non-securitizing financial institutions
over time. As a consequence, securitization in the empirical model (SEC) corresponds to
a dummy variable that assumes value equal to 1 from the first issuance of FDIC by the
financial institutions and value equal to 0 otherwise. In short, this is a simple manner for
detecting the impact caused after financial institutions make use of the securitization.

          According to Santomero and Babbel (1997, p. 240), “credit risk is the risk that
   borrower will not perform in accordance with its obligations”. Furthermore,
   securitization of assets can influence credit risk in two ways: (i) financial institution
   transfer assets of good quality through securitization and thereby increases the credit
   risk in its portfolio thus worsening its financial wealth, and (ii) financial institution
   transfer credit risk to other market agents which, in turn can increase the risk in the
   financial system. In this case, the assets with worse quality are transferred and those
   with good quality are held by the institution implying an improvement in its portfolio.
   With the objective of observing whether the Brazilian financial institutions have
   employed securitization as a way of transferring part of their credit risk, we use two
   variables for measuring this type of risk. As suggested by Cardone-Riportella,
   Samaniego-Medina, and Trujillo-Ponce (2010), we use the following variables:
   - Loan Loss Reserve/Gross Loans ratio (CR1) – this ratio indicates how much of the
   total loan portfolio is covered by the entity’ current reserves. A higher ratio indicates a
   lower quality loan portfolio.
   - Non-performing Loans/Gross Loans ratio (CR2) – this ratio denotes the amount of the
   total doubtful loans and thus lower ratios denote a better asset quality.
          As pointed out by Santomero and Babbel (1997), credit risk is difficult to
   eliminate completely. Therefore, we assume that the current credit risk is not
   independent from that observed in the past. In other words, there is a “persistence
   effect”. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider that the effect of the securitization
                                                6
operations on the credit risk is not instantaneous. In addition, with the objective to avoid
potential problems of simultaneity and endogeneity, as observed in Michalak and Uhde
(2012) and Cardone-Riportella, Samaniego-Medina, and Trujillo-Ponce (2010), the
variables are lagged by one period in the model. Hence, to verify the effect of
securitization activity on credit risk (CR), our general specification is as follows:
(1)    CRi,t = f(CRi,t-1,SECi,t-1, Zi,t-1),
where: CR is the credit risk measured by two alternative variables: Loan Loss
Reserve/Gross Loans ratio (CR1) and Non-performing Loans/Gross Loans ratio (CR2);
SEC is a dummy as described earlier; Z covers mostly financial institutions’ individual
characteristics; sub-index i refers to financial institutions and t to the time periods.
       With the intention of mitigating omitted variable biases we consider well-
accepted variables present in the literature on the relation between credit risk and
securitization. As most studies take into consideration the influence from liquidity,
equity or regulatory capital, and performance in the analysis on securitization (see
Cardone-Riportella, Samaniego-Medina, and Trujillo-Ponce, 2010) we included the
following variables in the empirical model:
- Liquidity – as highlighted by Loutskina and Strahan (2009), due to the fact that loans
have become more liquid, credit supply has become less sensitive to changes in bank
financial condition. In particular, the same authors highlight that liquidity provides a
substitute source of finance for loan origination because the originator need not hold the
loan. As a consequence, we consider liquid assets/total assets ratio (LIQ) as a proxy for
liquidity in the empirical model.
- Indebtedness – as pointed out by Michalak and Uhde (2012), there is a relationship
between credit risk securitization and the bank’s financial soundness. The relevance of
this relation is also recognized, for example, in Affinito and Tagliaferri (2010). Hence,
we take into account total liabilities/total liabilities and the owner’s equity ratio (IND)
as an indicator that reflects the solvency of the financial institutions.
       As recognized by Bannier and Hänsel (2008) the wealth effects of securitization
transactions cannot be neglected. In this respect, we also include in the empirical model
a variable traditionally used as proxy for the performance of a financial institution:
– Return on equity (ROE) – measures the rate of return on the shareholders’ equity of
the common stock owners. Then, it is a result of net income/shareholder’s equity ratio.
       Data is gathered from Central Bank of Brazil (balance sheet of independent
                                              7
financial institutions - documents 7002/4010) regarding information of 60 financial
institutions from December 2002 to October 2012 with quarterly frequency (table 2
presents the descriptive statistics).
         Based on the variables described above, we consider three models for observing
a possible effect caused by the securitization process on the credit risk of the financial
institutions. The baseline model which is given by:
(2)      CRi,t = β0 + β1SECi,t-1 + β2CRi,t-1 + β3 LIQi,t-1 + εi,t,
where the subscript i=1,2,…,60 is the financial institution; t=1,2,…,40 is the period, and
εi,t is the disturbance.
         The next two models include the variables IND and ROE, respectively. As a
consequence:
(3)      CRi,t = β4 + β5SECi,t-1 + β6CRi,t-1 + β7LIQi,t-1 +β8 INDi,t-1 + εi,t; and
(4)      CRi,t = β9 + β10SECi,t-1 + β11CRi,t-1 + β12LIQi,t-1 + β13INDi,t-1 + β14ROE i,t-1 + εi,t.

       This study uses panel data analysis. Besides usual OLS methods for panel data
analysis found in the literature for estimations of credit risk, this study makes use of
dynamic panel data framework (D-GMM and S-GMM). It is important to note that there
is the possibility of simultaneity problem in the analysis due to the fact that the financial
wealth of banking firms may be influenced by credit risk, which, in turn, suggests
endogeneity problem in the regressions. The use of instrumental variables allows the
estimation of parameters more consistently, even in the case of endogeneity in
explanatory variables (Bond, Hoeffler, and Temple, 2001). An additional justification
for using GMM is that including lagged dependent variables in panel models generates
a dynamic panel bias (Wooldridge, 2002). Furthermore, as pointed out by Affinito and
Tagliaferri (2010), the use of GMM estimators can be a useful tool to analyze the

                                                 8
relation between securitization and credit risk due to the heterogeneity among the
financial institutions.
       As for the issue of endogeneity, Arellano and Bond (1991) use the first difference
of the data and then use lagged values of the endogenous variables as instruments.
However, Blundell and Bond (1998) showed that the first-difference GMM has a bias
(for large and small samples) and low accuracy. Furthermore, the use of lagged levels
can generate weak instruments (Arellano and Bover, 1995; and Staiger and Stock,
1997). As a way of improving the efficiency by mitigating the weak problem in the D-
GMM, Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) suggest the addition
of moment conditions. As a result, S-GMM combines regression equations in
differences and in levels into one system and uses lagged differences and lagged levels
as instruments.1
       While D-GMM and S-GMM estimation approaches are suitable for a small
number of time periods (t) and a large number of individuals (i) in small samples, when
the instruments are too many, they tend to over-fit the instrumented variables and bias
the results (Roodman, 2009). Hence, with the objective of avoiding the use of an
excessive number of instruments in the regressions and thus lose the power of above-
mentioned tests, the number of instruments/number of cross-sections is less than 1 in
each regression. Moreover, in order to confirm the validity of the instruments in the
models, the test of over-identifying restrictions (J-test) was used as suggested by
Arellano (2003). In addition, tests of first-order (AR1) and second-order (AR2) serial
correlation were performed.
       It is important to highlight that although we perform two-step GMM estimation,
our sample is not characterized by a case of small number of periods t (t=40) and it is
not small relative to the number of financial institutions (i=60). Thus there is not the
risk of over-fitting the instrumented variables and biasing the results, thereby making
the two-step system GMM estimator consistent (see Hayakawa, 2012).2

  Besides lagged values of the endogenous variables, we use the Basel index and the return on assets
(ROA) as instruments in the models.

  Hence, the Windmeijer’s (2005) finite sample correction of the two-step estimator variance-covariance
matrix to avoid downward biased estimations is not applied.

3. Estimation results


        We present baseline empirical results in tables 3 and 4. Robustness checks
regarding determinants of securitization are reported in tables 5 and 6. The use of both
D-GMM and S-GMM do not change the signs and the statistical significance of the
coefficient on securitization for both measures of credit risk presented in fixed effect
models (see tables 3 and 4). Furthermore, all GMM regressions accept the null
hypothesis in the Sargan tests (J-statistic) and thus the over-identifying restrictions are
valid. Moreover, both serial autocorrelation tests (AR(1) and AR(2)) reject the
hypothesis of the presence of serial autocorrelation.
        The statistical significance and the positive coefficients on the variable SEC
denote that the credit risk increases after the securitization of assets by financial
institutions. One interpretation of this result is that the securitization operation would
not be used for transferring credit risk to other financial institutions thus indicating good
quality credit.3 Another possible interpretation for the positive relationship between
securitization and credit risk is in line with Dionne and Harchaoui (2003). According to
this view, it is possible that the current regulation may be too costly and securitization
activity may therefore be used to reduce this cost.
        Regarding the coefficients on lagged credit risk it is observed that there is
statistical significance and the sign is positive (see tables 3 and 4). This result suggests
that there exists a credit risk persistency probably caused by the long-term maturity of
the banking operations. In addition, this result is in line with the idea present in
Santomero and Babbel (1997) that credit risk is diversifiable but difficult to eliminate
completely.

       In a general way, the coefficients on liquidity, indebtedness, and ROE are
positive in all models and have statistical significance in some specifications (see tables
3 and 4). Although the coefficients on liquidity are positive, most of them are not
significant and thus are in consonance with the Affinito and Tagliaferri (2010)
observation that bank liquidity becomes less important in the presence of securitization.
Regarding the positive relation between indebtedness and credit risk there is no surprise.
A higher indebtedness indicates a higher liability of the institution which in turn reveals
a higher credit risk (de Mendonça and Loures, 2009). Similar to that found by Ben
Salah and Fedhila (2012), positive coefficient and significance statistics on ROE is
observed in most specifications. As pointed out by Yu (2012), a higher ROE (a higher-
risk portfolio may increase the chances of higher return) may be associated with
potential credit losses (a higher-risk portfolio will increase the chances of higher losses).
In short, there is an increase in risk appetite and thus a trade-off between risk and return.


4. Robustness analysis


       The results from the estimation of the credit risk indicate that securitization
increases the risk. This observation suggests that securitization of assets in Brazil does
not transfer credit risk to other financial institutions. Therefore, it is important to
identify which factors stimulate the securitization in Brazil. In general, the literature
highlights three factors for securitization: (i) transfer of the credit risk to other financial
institutions; (ii) increase in the liquidity; and (iii) regulatory capital arbitrage. Moreover
profitability and financial institutions’ size are also factors considered in the analysis on
determinant of securitization.4 With the objective of observing the direct relationship
between credit risk and securitization we used the same methodology applied in the
previous section. Hence, using the variables CR, LIQ, IND, ROE, and SEC lagged as
regressors, the following specifications are considered:
(4)    SECi,t = α0 + α1SECi,t-1 + α2CRi,t-1 + α3 LIQi,t-1 + εi,t,
(5)    SECi,t = α4 + α5SECi,t-1 + α6CRi,t-1 + α7LIQi,t-1 + α8 INDi,t-1 + εi,t; and
(6)    SECi,t = α9 + α10SECi,t-1 + α11CRi,t-1 + α12LIQi,t-1 + α13INDi,t-1 + α14ROE i,t-1 + εi,t.
       We present the empirical results in tables 5 and 6.

         Such as observed for the estimations in the previous section, the results indicate
that there are no overidentification and autocorrelation problems in all models (see J-
statistic, AR(1), and AR(2) reported in tables 5 and 6).
         The estimation results confirm the hypothesis that credit risk is not a determinant
factor for securitization in Brazil (there is no statistical significance in practically all
models - see tables 5 and 6). Therefore, contrary to Bannier and Hänsel (2008) and
Gorton and Souleles (2007) we cannot state that financial institutions with greater risk
are more active in securitization operation.
         The coefficients on liquidity are positive and have statistical significance in half
of the specifications. This result matches with Agostino and Mazzuca (2008). A
possible justification for this result is that the relationship between liquidity and
securitization may assume a positive sign if the liquidity increases the collateral.
Regarding the positive coefficient and statistical significance on indebtedness for most
specifications, this result suggests that the financial institutions try to reduce their
fragility through securitization. The positive coefficient on ROE without statistical
significance is compatible with the idea that banks with higher profits are not likely to
resort to loan securitizations to improve their profitability (Affinito and Tagliaferri,
2010).


5. Conclusion


         Such as observed for the European case, the securitization of assets is relevant
for small and medium financial institutions in Brazil.5 Therefore, as pointed out by
Fabozzi and Kothari (2007), securitization represents an alternative tool for reducing
fundraising costs. Our results support that the use of securitization operation has a
positive impact on credit risk of the Brazilian financial institutions. This result indicates
that it is possible that banks hold poor assets and thus transfer to others only credit with
good quality.6 In short, a very important result is that securitization increases the credit
risk in the Brazilian case. As a consequence, it is essential that the Central Bank of
Brazil (financial regulator) draws regulation policies that avoid the increase in the
financial fragility.

 Regarding the European case, see Uzun and Webb (2007), and Uhde and Michalak (2010).

 The result that securitization does not imply transfer of credit risk is in line with Cardone-Riportella,
Samaniego-Medina, and Trujillo-Ponce (2010), and Affinito and Tagliaferri (2010).
