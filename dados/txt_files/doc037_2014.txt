      The aim of this paper is to examine whether monetary and fiscal policies have sym-
      metric effects across the regions of Brazil. For this, I use a SVAR model in which a
      Bayesian sign restrictions approach is adopted to identify the shocks. The results indi-
      cate that regional products tend to have similar reactions to monetary policy shocks,
      but asymmetric responses to fiscal policy shocks. Moreover, monetary policy shocks
      have more influence on economic activity than fiscal policy shocks in all regions.

1    Introduction
This paper aims to analyze the impacts of economic policies on the output of the Brazilian
regions, investigating whether monetary and fiscal policy shocks have different impacts
on the different regions. For this, I estimate a Structural Vector Auto-Regressive (SVAR)
model to get the impulse response functions that show how the regional outputs behave
after orthogonal shocks prompted by policies. The identification of shocks in the model is
performed with a Bayesian signs restriction approach proposed by Mountford and Uhlig
(2009).
    Concern about the differential impact of economic policies on the dynamics of a coun-
try’s regions or a group of countries has become the subject of recent interest in the eco-
nomic literature. Accordingly, Carlino and DeFina (1998) show that although there is little
doubt about the impact of monetary policy on an aggregate entity, when analyzed from
the perspective of regional and state economies, monetary policy has a differential impact
depending on the economic diversity, demographics, financial development, and other
factors of the economies concerned.
    Likewise, Owyang et al. (2005) state that it is reasonable to assume that regional economies
also tend to respond differently to fiscal shocks due to the differences discussed above or
other possible characteristics, such as geographical heterogeneity, different stages of busi-
ness cycles and fiscal indicators.
    Important studies aimed to examine whether monetary policy shocks have different
impacts on the economic dynamics of a country’s regions or a group of countries (e.g., Ger-
lach and Smets, 1995; Carlino and DeFina, 1998, 1999; Di Giacinto, 2003; Owyang et al.,
2005; Francis et al., 2009). In general, this studies show that monetary policy shock has
different effects in the regions output, except Gerlach and Smets (1995) that find no dif-
ferent responses among G-7 countries. Carlino and DeFina (1999) find evidence that the
response of the U.S. states is positively correlated to the share of manufacturing sector
in the state output. Francis et al. (2009) argue that demographic and local government
characteristics can also explain these different responses. On the other hand, Di Giacinto
(2003) find evidence that the interactions across states tend to smooth out responses across
space.
    With few exceptions, the impacts of monetary shocks on the dynamics of the regional
economies of Brazil have been little explored. I highlight the studies of Araújo (2004),
Bertanha and Haddad (2008) and Rocha et al. (2011). These papers find evidence that
monetary policies have different impacts in regional terms from the estimation of Vec-
tor Autoregressive (VAR) models. However, there are some significant differences in the
results. Araújo (2004) finds that the South region is more affected by a monetary policy
shock than Northeast region. Bertanha and Haddad (2008) state that North and Northeast
regions are more vulnerable to monetary shocks. Finally, Rocha et al. (2011) find asym-
metric responses between the states, but there is no evidence between regions.
    Regarding the impact of fiscal policies, the studies have focused predominantly on the
aggregate level (e.g., Fatás and Mihov, 1998; Blanchard and Perotti, 2002; Perotti, 2008;
Mountford and Uhlig, 2009), with little or no effort to understand the disaggregate cases.
In part, this neglect can be justified by the relative difficulty of reaching a consensus on
the basic effects of fiscal shocks (as opposed to the relative consensus on the impacts of

                                             2
monetary policies) as discussed by Perotti (2008).
    This point is explored by Owyang and Zubairy (2009). The authors investigate how
changes in military and non-military federal spending impact the dynamics of the U.S.
states. They find evidence of significant asymmetries in how states respond to fiscal stim-
uli. They associate such asymmetries with differences in the propagation mechanisms
of shocks in federal military and non-military spending. While the former affect the
economies with larger retailers and manufacturing sectors more strongly, the latter af-
fects the states with more diverse industrial composition more strongly. The results also
showed that government spending impacts the states with lower per capita income more
intensely.
    Some papers have also focused on identifying the impacts of fiscal shocks on the Brazil-
ian aggregate-level economy. For example, Mendonça et al. (2009) estimate an SVAR
model and use a sign restrictions approach in the identification of shocks. The authors
investigate how changes in current government spending and net public revenues affect
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), private consumption and inflation. The results sug-
gest that an unexpected increase in government spending causes an increase in private
consumption, a fall in GDP and an increase in interest rates, providing evidence for the
effect of the crowding out of private investment by the public. The authors also show that
an increase in net public revenues (i.e., a net increase in taxes) causes a reduction in GDP
and private consumption. The authors suggest that fiscal policy in Brazil is pro-cyclical, in
contrast to how fiscal policy has been implemented in developed countries (Perotti, 2008).
    Peres and Ellery Jr. (2009), on the other hand, use an identification scheme based on the
methodology of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) to investigate the effects of fiscal shocks on
GDP. They show that unexpected increases in federal government spending are positively
related to the output, while increases in the tax burden are negatively related. In short,
they show typical Keynesian results.
    In summary, this paper contributes to the literature by investigating whether vari-
ous economic shocks have differential impacts on the regions of Brazil, a country charac-
terized by regional diversity in productive structure, level of financial development and
income. Moreover, it is the first attempt to study shocks and regions in an integrated
approach using advanced techniques of shocks identification.
    The results indicate that regions tend to have similar reactions in terms of business
cycles and monetary policy shocks, but asymmetric responses to fiscal policy shocks. Fur-
thermore, monetary shocks are more important than fiscal shocks in explaining product
fluctuations in all regions.

ology; the third part features the data; the fourth part is dedicated to the results; and the

    Although the model to be estimated consists of the VAR in its reduced form, it is re-
quired by this study to obtain the response functions to orthogonal shocks. These func-
tions represent the system endogenous variables’ responses to a shock in one of the ele-
ments of the εt vector.
    In this paper, I adopt the sign restriction approach proposed by Uhlig (2005) and
Mountford and Uhlig (2009) to do the identification of the macroeconomic policy shocks.
I present this methodology below.
    Let Σ be the variance-covariance matrix of the VAR reduced-form residuals, Ã is the
Cholesky decomposition matrix and A a matrix such that Σ = AA0 = ÃÃ0 . So A = ÃQ,
where Q is an orthogonal matrix. Thus, we have that any impulse vector can be written
as:

                                                        a = Ãα,                                       (4)
where a is a columm of A that contains the contemporary responses of the variables to
a particular shock, and α is a column of in the corresponding position. Thus, the shocks
due to an impulse a(rt ) in the k period can be calculated from the shocks of the Cholesky
decomposition Cholesky (ri ):

    Based on the above equation, it is possible to determine the impulse vector correspond-
ing to an economic policy shock. To do so, we must define such shocks. Accordingly, I use
the shocks characterization proposed by Mountford and Uhlig (2009), which defines the
economic shocks as follows: (a) business cycle shock, ac , as a shock which jointly moves
consumption and government revenue up for K periods; (b) monetary policy shock, am ,
as a shock which jointly moves interest rate up and monetary base and prices down for K
periods and is orthogonal to the business cycle shock; (c) government spending shock,ag ,
as a shock which moves up government spending for K periods and is orthogonal to the
two previous shocks; and (d) government revenue shock, ar , as a shock which moves the
government tax revenue down for K and is orthogonal to the others shocks. In this paper,
I consider K = 6, that is, for an impulse vector be considered a government spending
shock, for example, it is necessary that it doesn’t promote a reduction in the government
spending in six months, at least.
    These shock definitions aren’t sufficient to ensure the exact identification, and must
be complemented. For that, I use a Bayesian approach in which the VAR coefficients
are considered random variables. Thus, the impulse vector set Ψ(B, K, Σ), that can be
generated from ordinary least squares estimated coefficients (B), its variance-covariance
matrix (Σ), and the imposed sign restrictions, can have many elements.
    The selection of the impulse vectors that show the necessary characteristics is made by
the minimization of a penalty function. This function is defined in the unitary sphere, and
penalizes every relevant deviation from the sign restrictions by solving

   The criterion function Φ(a) adds the penalties during the k = 0, . . . , K periods follow-
ing the shocks with respect to the index set of variables for which identification of a given
shock restricts the impulse response to be positive (Js,+ ) or negative (Js,− ). The responses
are normalized by the standard deviation sj of variable j.
   Similary to Uhlig (2005) and Mountford and Uhlig (2009), I take up 250 attempts from
the VAR reduced-form coefficients posterior distribution (Normal-Wishart), and identify
the shocks for each of them.

3    Data
The data base covers the period from January 2003 to December 2012, at monthly fre-
quency. For the estimation of the SVAR model, I consider the following information: in-
dexes of regional economic activity of the five Brazilian regions, BCB; spending of the
central government in funding and capital, STN; chained index of apparent consump-
tion of final goods, IPEA; central government revenue, STN; interest rate Over / Selic (%
per month), BCB; monthly inflation measured by the consumer price index (IPCA), IBGE;
monetary base, BCB; index of the Effective Real Exchange rate, IPEA; and, loans to the
private sector, BCB. All series are seasonally adjusted and placed in logarithms (except
the interest rate and inflation).

The impulse response functions of the estimated SVAR model , which show the behavior
of the variables after an economic shock, are discussed in this section. The lag order of the
model is taken to be one lag, as indicated by the selection criteriaons (Akaike, Schwarz
and Hannan-Quinn). Table 1 shows the results.

    In response to the business cycles shock (Figure 1), consumption and government rev-
enue increase in the first six months by construction. In addition, government revenue
and expenditures increase in similar proportion (approximately 4%). Prices also increase,
probably due to the demand increment. The interest rate has a small reduction at the
time of the shock, but reveals an upward trend in the following months, indicating that
the response of the monetary authority occurs with some lag. As a result of the shock,
the monetary base increases, the real exchange rate appreciates, and the credit falls in the
first three months, then rises. In regional terms, the production of all regions increases.
The South, Southeast (as we expected) and North (unexpected) are the regions with the
greatest response occurring around the fifth month. However, the North is the only region
that presents a negative contemporaneous response.Besides, the response of the Central-
West’s output is the smallest. This results suggest a positive correlation between the effect
of a business cycle shock and the share of manufacturing in the regional output. Finally,
shock effects tend to disappear in fifteenth months for all five regions.

    In the case of monetary policy shock (Figure 2), interest rate increases, while prices
and monetary base decrease by construction. Both revenue and spending increase mo-
mentarily but are little affected later. In addition, real exchange rate appreciates, only
contemporaneously, and amount of credit is reduced. Consumption and regional produc-
tion contemporaneously increase, except in the Central-West region, but tend to have a
negative response in the following months. The behaviors of the regions after the shock
are not very different. The regional output tends to fall, between 0.2 and 0.3%, at most
(around the fifth month). This result is in line with Di Giacinto (2003) who report that
interaction across regions tend to smooth out the responses to a monetary policy shock.
    Regarding the shock that reduces government revenue by construction (Figure 3), it is
observed that government spending also falls by a similar scale. The credit and exchange
rate are not affected significantly. Inflation and consumption display contemporary pos-
itive responses and then stabilize. The production of all regions has contemporaneous
positive responses but does not seem to be significantly affected in the long term. The
Central-West and North regions showed lowest responses, while the South and Southeast
showed the highest.
    The shock that increases government spending (Figure 4) also promotes an equivalent
increase in revenue. Exchange rate, credit and monetary base are not affected. Consump-
tion and inflation fall contemporaneously, but the shock dissipates quickly. The produc-
tion of the regions does not respond significantly to the shock.

     Responses to Spending

    Based on the estimated SVAR model, I also calculated the variance decomposition of
the forecast error of the levels of regional production in relation to the four studied shocks.
The results are shown in Table 2.
    The variance of the forecast error in the activity level of the five Brazilian regions is
explained for the most part by the business cycles shocks. The monetary shock is the
second most important, especially in the short term (one to three months). The Central-
West region is the one in which the fiscal policy shocks, especially ones in government
spending, explain a significant portion of the variance of the forecast error in the short
term.
    Mountford and Uhlig (2009) argue that fiscal shocks can be described as a linear com-
bination of changes in spending and revenues. To deal with this problem, the fiscal shocks
were estimated again considering three different scenarios: (1) only government spend-
ing increases in the period; (2) only government revenue decreases in a given period; (3)
revenue and spending increase in the same proportion (balanced budget).
    In the case of a policy characterized by a balanced budget (Figure 5), inflation falls
for the first month and then stabilizes. The interest rate increases from the second month,
the monetary base expands, the exchange rate depreciates and the credit volume increases
slightly during the first six months, and then the variables stabilize. Regarding the level of
regional activity, there is a decrease in the South and Southeast regions. The Central-West
and North do not seem to be affected. The Northeast has a mild reduction in the level of
activity from the sixth month lasting about a year until it stabilizes again.
    For the fiscal policy in which the level of government spending increases and the rev-
enue remains constant (Figure 6), it is observed that consumption and inflation are little
affected. The interest rate is reduced in the first six months and then stabilizes. There are
no significant changes in credit, exchange rate or monetary base. The regional activity also
shows no significant changes in the Central-West or North. In the Northeast, South and
Southeast, there are small increases in production from the sixth month. The response of
the South is greater.
    Finally, an isolated reduction in government revenue (Figure 7) promotes increased
consumption, inflation, exchange rate appreciation, and reduction in the monetary base
and volume of credit. The interest rate decreases in the first month following the shock.
Regional outputs behave similarly to the previous case, the Central-West and North are
unaffected, and the Northeast, Southeast and South have positive changes. Again, the
response of the South is greater. Considering the past results, the fiscal policy seems to
affect more the regions with greater share of secondary and tertiary sectors in GRP.
    The variance decomposition of the forecast error of the regions output considering
the three scenarios of fiscal policy are shown in Table 3. The results indicate that the
product of the five Brazilian regions is explained for the most part by the fiscal policy
shock caracterized by a decrease of government revenue. The balanced budget shock is
the second most important.

5   Conclusions
This paper aims to analyze the effects of monetary and fiscal policy shocks on the Brazil-
ian economy from a regional perspective. Therefore, we estimate a VAR model with the
output from each of the five Brazilian regions, policy variables and other relative macroe-
conomic variables. The sign restrictions approach is used to identify the shocks.
   The results indicate that there are no significant differences in how the production of
each region responds to a business cycle shock. All regions show a positive and lasting
response.
   The regional products also behave similarly in response to monetary policy shocks.

The output tends to fall in short run in all regions. The effects of the monetary policy
shock are shorter lived than those of the business cycle.
    With respect to a reduction in government revenue, it is noticeable that the South and
Southeast regions respond more sharply, but this shock has no long-term effects in any
of the regions. If the revenue reduction is not accompanied by changes in spending, the
responses are more extensive in all regions.
    Finally, none of the regions seem to be affected significantly by an increase in govern-
ment spending. However, when a spending increase occurs without a change in govern-
ment revenue, the Northeast, Southeast and South regions exhibit a significantly positive
response after about six months. These are the regions in which secondary and tertiary
sectors are relatively more important.
    Thus, it is concluded that the Brazilian regions exhibit different behaviors in responses
to economic shocks, especially in terms of various given scenarios of fiscal policy. The
government should consider these differences when tailoring policies to achieve its vari-
ous goals. Future research should seek to clarify the reasons for these differences.
