Abstract
We reconsider Kaldor (1966) model of growth and income distribution where he introduces some ideas of
financial market in the “Cambridge Equation”, extending it to a general model with government activities
and an Open Economy. We show how the implications of Political Orientation affect the income
distribution. This paper corrects Charles (2007) about the negatively effects the income distribution when
the government expands the consumption in favour to households. We also prove that the political choice,
both in the case with and without an Open Economy, does not influence the essential nature of the Kaldor
neo-Pasinetti dynamic equilibrium and the “Cambridge Equation”. Connections with the neo-Kaleckians
or post-Kaleckians theories (wage-led and export-led growth) are considered. Next, applying the Olech’s
Theorem we guarantee that the global equilibrium is stable in both cases.

Resumo
Reconsiderando o modelo de crescimento e distribuição de renda de Kaldor (1966), onde ele introduz
algumas ideias de mercado financeiro na “Equação de Cambridge”, nós estendemos aqui para um modelo
geral com atividades governamentais e Economia Aberta. Mostramos quais os efeitos a distribuição de
renda quando consideradas as Políticas Orientadas. Este artigo corrige Charles (2007), sobre os efeitos
negativos encontrados na distribuição de renda quando o governo expande o consumo em favor das
famílias. Nós também provamos que as escolhas políticas, para ambos os casos com e sem Economia
Aberta, não afetam a natureza da dinâmica de equilíbrio Kaldor neo-Pasinetti e da “Equação de
Cambridge”. São consideradas conexões com as teorias neo-Kaleckianas e pós-Kaleckianas (wage-led e
export-led). Por fim, aplicamos o Teorema de Olech, garantindo que ambos os casos são globalmente
estáveis no equilíbrio.

1. Introduction
       The theory of long-run growth macroeconomic analyses starts when Harrod (1939) and Domar
(1947) present the “razor wire” problem, which implicates that the growth of the economy could be
sustainable if the natural growth ratio is equal to the effective growth ratio. By analysing this problem,
Solow (1956) and Kaldor (1956) search for an alternative solution. The latter creates a theory of growth
based on the side of income distribution. This effort shows us that the growth rate will be given by the
multiplication between the propensity to save and the profit rate of the economy. Such result was named as
“Cambridge Equation” and all extensions from this theorem have to return to the original result if the
modifications are not considered.
        Studying the kaldorian approach, Pasinetti (1962) divide the economy in two classes, workers and
capitalists, saying that Kaldor (1956) committed a “logical sleep” when he did not consider the division of
classes. Pasinetti proves that the “Cambridge Equation” is not given by de propensity to save of the
economy, but only from the propensity to save of the capitalists. This indicates how much the economy
will grow.
        Using this classes division, but named the capitalists as firms, Kaldor (1966) create the “Kaldor neo-
Pasinetti Theorem”. His model present two sides. It shows how the existence of the financial system
implicates on the income distribution. The first side indicates the traditional profit rate and the second the
valuation ratio of the firms in the financial market. The significant point of this theorem is that the profit
rate affects negatively the valuation ratio, and the existence of financial assets leads to a reduction of the
profit rate.
       Concerned with to how the valuation ratio and the profit rate behave in Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model,
Araújo (1995) reproduce graphically the theory and design the model as an IS-LM alternative. Another
extension is presented by Panico (1997), which introduce the concept of capital gains to analyse how the
existence of firms can impact the level of income and the implication on the income distribution with
government activities. It is interesting to note that all the Political Orientations of the above extensions were
assumed to be exogenous. Trying to endogenize these assumptions, Charles (2007) introduces the concept
of investment increased by government expenditures involving two favouring choices. The first is to
increase the consumption (households) and the second to expand the profit of the economy (firms).
        The relevance of the Kaldor-Pasinetti theory persists in our days, Romero (2019) combine the
kaldorian perspective with Schumpeter to present a new cumulative growth model. Another example is the
empirical analyses to the case of the “Cambridge Equation”. Pacheco-Lópes and Thirlwall (2014) verify
the association between manufacturing output growth, export growth as well as between export growth and
GDP growth in 89 developing countries. Bernardo, Stockhammer and Martínez (2016) shows the
reinterpretation of the Tobin’s q from the Kaldor neo-Pasinetti perspective. George (2018) made a positive
analysis of the modern capitalism from the Pasinetti perspective to consider the implication of investors
decisions in a long-run perspective.
        The present article, focussing the kaldorian perspective, analyses the interaction between
government, financial market and an Open Economy (especially introducing the Political Orientation to the
model). In this case, we are dealing with a more realistic context in comparison with the most of the
literature. This work is divided in five sections; the first one synthesizes the history and contextualizes the
literature. The second presents the evolution of the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model” and their extensions,
showing the development of the theory. Also corrects the formal version of the model published by Charles
(2007), since it contained a number of mistakes.
        In the third section we extend the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model” showing the effective expansion of
the consumption by the government and the stability condition of this extension. This improved alternative
has as consequence interesting results about the proper incentives (increasing consumption) of the Political
Orientations to households. This leads to a positive relation with income distribution. In the fourth section
we extend our model to the case of an Open Economy showing the impact of this new configuration, using
                                                       2
the same approach as in the third section when we use the Olech’s Theorem for the stability condition, as
was presented by Garcia (1972). Section 5 contains the conclude remarks.


2. Review of the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model” and extensions
       Kaldor (1966) starts with the assumptions that in this model we have two classes, firms and workers.
The first agent is owned by capitalists and workers (households) and the profit is divided between then. 4
The last agent will also be remunerated with wages coming from his\her jobs. The sum of these two
remunerations is equal to the national income. The savings functions are similar to the one used by Pasinetti
(1962) when he made the distinction between workers and of capitalists. Following Kaldor (1966) and
Charles (2007) assumptions:5

                                                            S = S w + Sf                                                 (ii)
                                                           Sw = sw W                                                    (iii)
                                                            Sf = sf P                                                   (iv)
                                                            xI = sw W − cG                                               (v)

        The difference from the equations above and Kaldor (1956) is that he and Charles (2007) consider
that the total saving is composed by the one of workers and that of firms. The new part of the investment
function derived from the financial market is given by (v).An interesting property of this equation is to
show that the existence of financial market will be direct affected from workers savings.
Following the assumptions by Kaldor (1966), Araújo (1992), Charles (2007) and Lavoie (2014), the
equilibrium between investments and saving to maintain the full employment has to be written as in (vi)
and (vii):6

                                                I = sf P + xI                                                           (vi)
                                                I = sf P + sw W − cG, been 0 ≤ c ≤ 1                                   (vii)

        The capital gains in (v) and (vii) is provided from financial market equilibrium where the valuation
ratio (vr ) is equal to the amount value of equities (pN) divided by the total capital stock (K). That is:
                                                                        pN
                                                                 vr =                                                  (viii)
                                                                        K

        Deriving (viii) with respect to time, and applying some algebraic manipulations, we have the capital
gains function. This results can be either positive (capital gain), zero or negative (capital loses). Thus:

                                                             G = (vr − x)I                                              (ix)

        Substituting (ix) in (vii), Kaldor (1966), Araujo (1995), Charles (2007) obtained the main results
like as presented in Lavoie (2014). First of all, they find the profit rate “Cambridge Equation” (1), showing
that the existence of financial market will make a decreasing impact on the profit rate. The other result
presents the valuation ratio (2), which indicates the signal of capital gains. The rate of investment by
financial market is impacted positive in the valuation ratio:

  It is possible to consider that not all the workers own part of the firms, but those who have earn profits. This concept is
maintained in the rest of this paper.

       Following assumptions (i) to (ix), Panico (1997) introduced the government expenditures (x) which
increase the investment function (vii). He assumed that the government budget is balanced as expressed by
(x) and (xi):

                                     T = t w W + t p P, been 0 ≤ t w ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ t p ≤ 1                        (xi)


      Assuming the existence of government and the respective direct taxation, we obtain the right landside
of the equations (xii) and (xiii) which, in equilibrium, show that investment is equal to total amount of
saving, as expressed by (xii):

                                          I + Ge = sf (1 − t p )P + sw (1 − t w )W − cG                        (xii)

        After some mathematical manipulations, Panico (1997) shows new extensions of Kaldor (1966)
approach now with government activities, as presented in (3) and (4). The interesting part of these results
is concerned with the existence of the government expenditures affecting positively the profit rate and
negatively the valuation ratio as we can see in the equations below (we just have to make the partial derivate
of r and vr with the respect to g e ):

                        G
       Note that g e = Ke . However, the government expenditures decisions are exogenous. Wondering
about this, Charles (2007) elaborated a kaldorian extension model with Political Orientation which deserver
especial attention. The section V of his article starts by differencing the government orientation in two
ways. The first was to increase the consumption in favour to households and the second to increase profit
favouring to firms. Being 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, we have:

       The equation of the consumption (xvii) incorporates the taxation:

                                            C = cw (1 − t w )W + (1 − sf )(1 − t p )P + cG                    (xvii)

     Mathematical manipulations in the Appendix 2 indicate that Charles (2007) committed some
mathematical mistakes. Our first contribution corrects his results in relation to the consumption incentives.
His model disappeared with the difference between the valuation ratio and the share of investments financed

affect the income distribution negatively. In addition, the equation (7) and (8) indicate that government
expenditures tend to increase profit and the profit ratio will be bigger, favouring the firms.
        A number of extensions considers some cases and empirical applications for the Kaldor neo-
Pasinetti approach, published by Park (2002), Ryoo (2016) and Ryoo (2018). Thinking about the incentives
and fiscal policy we realized that some issues were not considered in the extensions above. One of our main
contribution is to present how much bigger it will be C̅ > 𝐶 . From this assumption we develop a new
extension of the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Theorem” with proper Political Orientation. We formulate this new
approach in section 3 of this paper.

3. Extension of the Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Model With Proper Political Orientations
        This part of our article focus on a generalization for the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Theorem”, concerning
governmental economic Political Orientation favouring consumption (benefit to households) and/or profit
(benefit to firms), from government preferences determinate by the political power. Our contribution is
composed in two characteristics: the first is that we are considering that the government can incentive
simultaneously both classes in the model and what happens in our new extension when the policymakers
decide to increase consumption. This is defined here as the sum of the consumption of the economy and
the incentive derived from the government expending (income transfer).
       Assume the assumptions below:

      Which represents the government expenditures considering Political Orientations to both
consumption and profit, where the first is designated to households and the second to firms. From some
mathematical manipulations, as we can see in the Appendix 3 (a), we develop our extension of the
“Cambridge Equation” to the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Theorem”.

        It is easy to see that the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Theorem” can be obtained by assuming that α = 0.
Furthermore, the extension of the “Cambridge Equation”, by Steedman (1972), is obtained if α = x = 0.
We get Pasinetti (1962) if α = x = t p = 0.
        Relaxing the assumption of full capacity utilization, we take into account the implications of non-
competitive markets and their imperfections8. To determine an investment function, as in models à la
Kalecki, it is possible to construct a new version of our extension with wage-led and profit led growth view.
Another accomplishment to consider, instead of to propose the incentives to consume, we determinate
income transfers to workers and the analysis of how will behave the fluctuation of the income in short,
medium9 as well as to determinate the equilibrium in long-run term from Kalecki’s and Kaldor’s visions.
        A desirable extension, linking the idea of Political Orientation and Kaleckians views, could be
supported by the following sentence in Lavoie and Stockhammer (2012, p. 1): “Income distribution can be
modified or influenced by appropriate government policies that act both on primary income distribution,
for instance by reinforcing the bargaining power of labour unions or securing low real interest rates and on
secondary income distribution, by modifying the tax code”. This is something to think in another work.
        To deal with the interrelation between neo-kaleckian (post-Kalekian10) and kaldorian models, in the
case of small closed economy for both theories, Araujo and Teixeira (2015) as well as Araujo and Teixeira
(2016) reinterpreted the “Cambridge Equation”, which can be viewed as particular case of the Kalecki

  For an example, consider the following parameters: β = , α = 1 , Gi = 4 and P  ̅ − P = 2 . From these values we have Ge =

consumption and 1 for incentives to profit.

         In the same way that r was analysed from (10), we can obtain from (11) the original model if α =

(households) and/or profit (firms), it follows that the income distribution will be affected positively.
Consequently the profit ratio will increase. Note that we have been dealing with a model for small closed
economy. In order to generalize our approach, we extended it to the case of an Open Economy in section

        Applying the Olech’s Theorem in (14), we have all the tools to analyse the stability in a Matrix 2x2.
This is a necessary and sufficient condition, if the trace is negative and the determinant is positive, thus:

       These results show us that with all the assumptions assumed above, the model is stable as required.
Furthermore, we conclude that our extension satisfied the stability conditions, as indicated in Figure1.

4. An extension of the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti model” with Political Orientation and an Open
Economy
        This section will concentrate on the implications of an Open Economy in a “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti
Model” with economic policy. We consider what happens if our extension takes into account the financial
international market and how this can improve the income distribution. Such formalized preoccupation
came from Kaldor (1966). We are considering an income function presented by Metcalfe and Steedman
(1979) and also used by Teixeira & Araújo (1997) when the latter introduced the idea of foreign bounds.
Thus:


                                                             Y=W+P+F                                                  (xxvii)


       Being, F = iZ, i = r, the new assets are holding by firms and will be introduced in the general saving
of an Open Economy impacting the aggregate investments. Let (xxviii) be the saving function and (xxix)
the aggregate investment. Thus:


                                       S = Sw + Sf = sw (1 − t w )W + sf (1 − t p )(P + F) − cG                      (xxviii)
                                                 AI = I + Ge + M − X + rZ                                             (xxix)

         From these new conditions we develop our extension considering an Open Economy, as we can see
below:


                                                        ng (1−x)+(1−β)αr̅+βαgi +gn z
                                             ∴ ⁡r = (1−β)α+s                                                             (18)

        The crucial point to notice is that (18) is an extension of the “Cambridge Equation” with Political
Orientation and an Open Economy. This extension can be linked to the neo-Kaleckian theory, when the
export-led growth model is considered. Such literature was started by Blecker (1989) and Bhaduri and
Marglin (1990). The former, was concerned with the relationship between income distribution and
international competitiveness, being extended by the later, which introduced the real exchange rate to the
model.
        Hein (2014, Chapter 7) shows that the exchange rate is the cause of redistribution in this kind of
models and he also presents the positive relationship between profit share and international
competitiveness. This assumption can be relevant if linked to our model and considers the effects13. In order
to introduce the financial sector, it is possible to follow the investment function presented by Arestis,
González-Martinez and Dejuán (2016), when they consider the relation between capital accumulation and
financial market.
        Therefore, as was done by Araujo and Lima (2007), it is possible to analyse the implications of the
balanced-payments-constrained growth in different economic structures and/or structural changes.
Following their proposal one may consider to construct a new Kaleckian extension to verify some

        The equations (18) and (19) show that in the case of an Open Economy and Political Orientation we
will have a positive result for the profit ration. On the other hand, like in Kaldor (1966), the implication of
the profit ratio will be negative to the valuation ratio. The partial derivative of profit ratio in relation to the
                                ∂r                                                                 ∂v
foreign equities is negative (∂z < 0). However to the valuation ratio it will be positive ( ∂zr > 0). One
important issue here is that both total income to capitalists and workers are direct influence from the Current
Balance of Payments (difference between exports and imports) and that is a sensitive issue, because in the
case of a sustainable deficit in the long-run perspective, both classes will be damaged as we can interpreted
in Teixeira and Araújo (1997).

4.1. Stability analyse of the model with an Open Economy.
         Using the procedure to the stability from extension without Open Economy, we now have to apply
it to this case. From (1B)16 we have:

               dr                                   sw                          sw
                    = E(r, vr ) = δ [g n −               ] = δ {g n + g n z −        (1 − t w ) − [(1 − β)α + sf (1 − t p )(1 + z) −
               dt                                   v                           v
                                                sw (1 − t w )(1 + z)]r + βαg i + (1 − β)r̅ + cgvr − cxg n }⁡, δ > 0 (20)

        Take into account the assumptions (xxv) and (xxvi), but considering the national income from
(xxvii), we have:

dvr                       Dp       Sp           s
      = E(r, vr ) = φ [ K −             ] = φ { vw (1 − t w ) − r[sw (1 − t w ) − sw (1 − t w )z] − cg n vr + cxg n − xg n } ,
 dt                                K
                                                                                                               ⁡⁡φ > 0 (21)

       To analyse the stability condition, we have to consider the first term of the Taylor expansion and
from this we obtain the matrix system and the matrix in the middle is Jacobian Matrix (J). Thus:


                                    −δ[(1 − β)α + sf (1 − t p )(1 + z) − sw (1 − t w )(1 + z)] δcg n
                    J[E(r, vr )] = [                                                                  ]                          (22)
                                              −φ[sw (1 − t w ) − sw (1 − t w )z]               −φcg n



14
   It is essential to know that, one important difference between the Kaldorians perspectives and the neo-Kaleckians approaches
on the capacity utilization is that in the first case is assumed full employment and in the second one is not. These imply in a great
difference in studies about structural change and economic structures. We recommend to read Palley (2013).
15
   If the reader has the intention to deepen in others kinds of methodologies issues on an Open Economy, we advise to read
Romero and McCombie (2017), especially for the case considering Thirlwall’s Law.

   “B” refers to equation (2B) in the Appendix 3 (b).
                                                                       10
        Applying the Olech’s Theorem in (22), we have all the tools to analyse the stability in a Matrix 2x2.
As already stated above, this is a necessary and sufficient condition if it trace is negative and the determinant
is positive, thus:


                      Tr(J) = −δ[(1 − β)α + sf (1 − t p )(1 + z) − sw (1 − t w )(1 + z)] − φcg n < 0                     (23)

                           |J| = δφcg n [(1 − β)α + sf (1 − t p )(1 + z)] > 0                                            (24)


       These results show us that, with all the assumptions assumed, the model continue stable as required.
From this we conclude that our extension satisfied the stability conditions, as we present in Figure 2.

       Equalizing the equation (16) and (17), we determinate the value of the equilibrium β to our
extension. Thus:


                             s
                            [ w (1−tw )−x(1−c)gn ][α+sf (1−tp )(1+z)−sw (1−tw )z]−[gn (1−x)+αr̅+gn z][cgn +sw (1−tw )]

                                                (αgi −αr̅)[cgn +sw (1−tw )]+ w (1−tw )α−x(1−c)gn α
                                                                                                                         (25)

       This expression determinates β when r = vr , as is presented in the Figure 2. An interesting issue
about this stability analysis is that, if we consider a small increase in z, the equilibrium between r and vr
does not modified, but the value of β∗ grows. Which means that the government will be forced to increase
consumption (incentive to households) more than the profit to maintain the equilibrium condition in long-
run.17
       Note that some care is essential concerning the use of a Political Orientation based on the strategy
of export-led growth. It is not difficult to raise the point that such approach necessarily suffers a fallacy of
composition. Of course, not all countries can pursue export-led growth simultaneously, unless the domestic
economy can expand as a result of a general international expansion of trade. We leave this issue to another
opportunity in which we intend of deal with special requirements involving the relevant equations in the

  It is possible to prove this affirmation, making a numerical exercise considering in the second extension z = 0 and
increasing the value of z.

5. Concluding remarks
        The present paper contains three important issues. The first, presented in the second section is that
kipping Charles (2007) hypotheses and correcting his mathematical mistakes, we have the same conclusion
that favouring households, the impact continues to be negative in relation to the income distribution.
        As a second issue, we presented in the section three a new version of the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti
Theorem” with Political Orientation. One relevant contribution of this part of our article is that the
government can decide how much will be designated as incentives to profit (firms) and/or to consumption
(households). As 0 ≤ β ≤ 1, our approach is relevant to the post-Keynesian theory since we consider a new
way to deal with government decision: the interval of political choice given by β. Another accomplishment
is that we established the difference between increased consumption by government expenditures and the
natural consumption of the economy (Gi ). Therefore, the impact of profit ratio is positive independently of
the governmental choice.
        At the subsection 3.1 we present the stability of the model. From this we can conclude that in the
long-run the extension will always converge to equilibrium in steady-state. This new extension can be
linked to the neo-Kaleckian theory with respect to the wage-led growth model.
        As was showed in the section 3 and 4, it is important to think, with the intend to develop some
interesting ideas, show how is it possible to link the Kaldor-Passinetti and neo-Kaleckian views, as we can
see in Fonseca and Araujo (2018), these models have lots of common principles.
        The third issue, in section four, is an extension of the “Kaldor neo-Pasinetti Model” with Open
Economy, government activities and Political Orientation. It shows that the globalization affect the income
distribution. The existence of international financial system increase the valuation ratio, which is positive
to the firms growing the value of their bonds by the introduction of foreign equities, one the other hand,
decrease the profit rate, however, increase the value of β. Implying that, in this condition, it is necessary
that the government grow the incentive to households to maintain the equilibrium. Especially the latter,
where we concluded that the profit ratio (with respect to foreign equities) has positive results. Subsection
4.1 show us that our model with an Open Economy, as in the subsection 3.1 is also stable. We showed that
our model can be connected with the export-led growth theory in the post-Kaleckian framework.
