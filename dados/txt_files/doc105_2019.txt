Abstract: We investigate the competitiveness of Brazilian and Chinese exports to
MERCOSUR from 2008 to 2017. Following conventional methods, we compute an Export
Similarity Index (ESI) for Brazilian and Chinese exports to MERCOSUR. This index is
disaggregated according to product similarities. Results show that the similarity between
Brazilian and Chinese product exports has increased over time. However, the ESI
disaggregation reveals that the similarities largely occur with vertically differentiated goods,
where the quality of the goods exported by Brazil are considered superior to those exported by
China. Thus, competition between Brazil and China in the MERCOSUR has declined over time
since the two countries export to different market segments.

Resumo: Este artigo investiga a competitividade das exportações brasileiras e chinesas para o
MERCOSUL para o período de 2008 a 2017. Com a utilização de métodos convencionais, o
Índice de Similaridade das Exportações (ISE) é calculado entre as exportações brasileiras e
chinesas para o MERCOSUL. Este índice é desagregado de acordo com as similaridades dos
produtos. Os resultados mostraram que similaridade entre as exportações brasileiras e chinesas
vem aumentando com o tempo. No entanto, a desagregação do ISE revelou que as maiores
similaridades vêm ocorrendo com produtos diferenciados verticalmente, ou seja, naqueles
produtos cuja qualidade se mostra superior para as exportações brasileiras do que as
exportações chinesas. Ou seja, a competição entre Brasil e China no MERCOSUL tem
declinado ao longo do tempo, pois os dois países exportam bens destinados para diferentes

1. INTRODUCTION

         A large portion of China’s economic growth can be attributed to increased
participation in international markets. The contribution of international trade to China's GDP
increased from virtually zero in the sixties to approximately 30 percent in 2006 (Rodrik, 2006).
By 2013 China became the world’s largest trading nation, outpacing the United States and
Germany. The rapid integration of China into world markets has attracted the attention of many
economists. Rodrik (2006) notes that, despite the important role of the intensive export sectors,
China has increased its exports of more sophisticated products. Paradoxically, despite low per
capita income, China has a highly sophisticated and diversified export structure, similar to
countries with per capita income many times higher.
         The international trade of China and Brazil is closely linked. Increased Chinese
participation in international markets has directly impacted Brazilian foreign trade. Between
2000 and 2009, total trade (exports plus imports) between Brazil and China increased from $
2.3 to $ 56.4 billion, making China the main trading partner of Brazil in 2009 (IPEA, 2011).
The pattern of trade between the two countries is clearly inter-industry in nature; Brazil exports
primary commodities (iron ore, soybeans and derivatives, leather products, wood pulp) and
imports mostly industrialized products (electrical equipment, inorganic chemicals, optical
instruments, photographic equipment) (IPEA, 2011). While China constitutes an important
target market for Brazilian exports, Chinese products compete with Brazilian products in
markets with similar export structures.
         Filgueiras and Kume (2010) analyze the degree of similarity of export structures of
Brazil and China in North American markets. By applying the Finger and Kreinin (1979)5
similarity index, the authors found that the similarity of each country’s their exports to North
American increased from 0.11 to 0.15 between the years 2000 to 2005, but retreated to 0.10 by
2008. Filgueiras and Kume suggest this decrease could be due to the displacement of Brazilian
exports by increased Chinese exports.
         Carmo et al. (2014) investigate the trade similarities between Brazilian and Chinese
exports to MERCOSUR for the period 1995-20096, and they conclude that the similarity of
exports for MERCOSUR has increasing over time, however, most of it based on vertically
differentiated products, which indicates that Chinese exports are not an important threat to the
Brazilian exports at the time.
         According to Fontagné et al. (2007) trade competition between countries can be
reduced if the products exported are vertically differentiated or have distinct qualities and thus
targeted for distinct market segments. To illustrate, these authors examined the competition
between the European Union (EU) and China in vertically differentiated products during the
period 1995-2004. They grouped the products into three categories: low, medium and high
quality according to the unit value of the product. They found the EU concentrated its exports
on the high-quality segment, while Chinese exports were concentrated on the low-quality
segment. They conclude that export competition is lessened when the exported products are
directed toward different market segments.

 The Finger and Kreinin index varies in the interval between 0 and 1. See section 3 for more details.

 In Carmo et al. (2014), however, it might be possible that the results were mostly influenced by the boom in the
commodities’ prices in the international markets.
                                                                                                                3

          Based on the contributions of Filgueiras and Kume (2010) and Fontagné et al. (2007),
our goal here is to analyze the competitiveness of exports from Brazil and China to
MERCOSUR7, in an attempt to revisit Carmo et al. (2014) study, but considering a more recent
period, without a possible influence of the commodities higher prices for the most of 2000s.
We begin by computing Finger and Kreinin´s index of export similarity. This is followed with
a disaggregation of the index to assess whether the quality of Brazilian products is superior or
inferior to the quality of Chinese products. We thus gain a more detailed and more
comprehensive understanding of the nature of competition between the two countries.
          The results of this study suggest that the similarity of exports from Brazil and China
in MERCOSUR has increased over time, suggesting that competition between countries has
become stronger. However, through the decomposition of the Finger and Kreinin (1979) index,
we find that the similarity of exports occurs mostly in vertically differentiated products, where
the quality of products exported by Brazil are higher than the quality of products exported by
China. These conclusions seem to confirm and stress most of the results showed in Carmo et
al. (2014).
          We follow with four sections. In Section 2 we present our theoretical framework. In
section 3 we describe our empirical strategy and data sources. We present and discuss our
results in Section 4. And, in section 5 we offer some concluding remarks.


2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND: HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL PRODUCTS
DIFFERENTIATION

          Products can be differentiated in either horizontal or vertical form. Horizontal
differentiation is due to heterogeneous consumer preferences. Even if the differences among
products are very subtle there is a consensus about which product is best. Vertically
differentiated products have substantial quality differences so that a consensus is reached as to
which product is preferred (Church and Ware, 2000).
          To better distinguish the concepts of horizontal and vertical differentiation we use an
example for the automobile industry where new cars are produced by different firms. These
cars can be described as horizontally differentiated, since they have certain characteristics and
attributes that distinguish them from each other. These differences are small and specific
resulting in a consensus among consumers about which car is better. Here we might compare
the products of different luxury car manufacturers.
        Vertically differentiated products show substantial quality differences, as when we
compare entry-level to luxury cars. Luxury cars have characteristics and attributes that elevate
them to a higher level than entry-level cars. Consumers are thus likely to conclude that luxury
cars are of higher quality than entry-level cars.


2.1. MAIN THEORETICAL MODELS

         The foundation of the neoclassical theory of international trade is the Heckscher-Ohlin
(HO hereafter) model. In this model international trade is determined by the comparative
advantage of countries, which stems from the relative abundance of capital and labor. The main
result is that capital-abundant countries specialize in the production/export of capital-intensive
products, while labor-abundant countries specialize in the production/export of labor-intensive
products. The resulting pattern depicts inter-industry trade behavior where countries trade
products from different industries.

7
  The choice of MERCOSUR was due to the fact that this market is an important export market for the Brazilian
manufactured products (Hiratuka and Cunha, 2011). MERCOSUR consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay.
                                                                                                             4

        The basic assumptions of the HO model began to be questioned in the literature when
Balassa (1967) and Grubel (1967) found that international trade between countries belonging
to the newly formed European Economic Community took place in two ways. Although the
trade list of countries can be similar, a different pattern of trade can emerge that is of intra-
industry in nature.
        While empirical evidence appeared in the sixties, not until the late seventies did
theoretical models of intra-industry trade emerge, from which we have the seminal work of
Krugman (1979, 1980, 1981).
        Krugman (1981) starts with a monopolistically competitive structure where economies
of scale are internal to the firm, and consumer preference is of the "love for variety" type.
Krugman shows that exported goods will be similar for all countries, following an intra-industry
pattern of trade. This model suggests that the specialization of countries no longer occurs at the
industry level, but at the product level, which is differentiated horizontally (in variety).
        The theoretical models of Krugman (1981) and Helpman and Krugman (1985)
accommodate inter-and intra-industry trade patterns. Krugman (1981) assumes that inter-
industry trade is explained by the comparative advantage of countries, as in the HO model,
while intra-industry trade is explained within a monopolistically competitive structure. The
conclusion of the Helpman and Krugman (1985) model is that the list of export products of the
countries will become more similar the greater the similarity in capital-labor ratios.
        It is important to mention that the models of Krugman (1979, 1980, 1981) and Helpman
and Krugman (1985) assume the productive specialization of countries might occur at the
product level, where it is differentiated horizontally i.e., by variety. However, some theoretical
literature finds the intra-product specialization may occur vertically, when it is differentiated
by quality as in Falvey (1981), Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987), Flam and Helpman (1987), and
Grossman and Helpman (1991).
        Falvey (1981) and Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987) demonstrated that vertical product
differentiation is a direct consequence of the differences in the production functions of trading
partners. The capital-abundant country will specialize in the production of differentiated high
quality products, while labor-abundant country will specialize in the production of low quality
products. Thus, models of Falvey (1981) and Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987) can be viewed as
a variation of the HO model. Instead of production specialization occuring at the industry level,
in Falvey (1981) and Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987) it occurs at the level of product
specialization, that is, varieties of a product have different qualities.
        Thus, while the HO model predicts trade of different goods, models based on Falvey
(1981) and Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987) considers trade in different varieties of goods, but
with different qualities. According to Greenaway and Milner (1986), "Falvey" type of models
can be considered neo-Heckscher-Ohlin model of intra-industry trade. These are based on the
assumptions described in Jones (1974) and Deardorff (1979), in which: (i) all countries have
access to the same production technology; (ii) the available technology is of constant returns to
scale; (iii) countries, on the supply side, differ only in the relative factor endowments; (iv)
different varieties of goods have different requirements of production factors, that is, the higher
the quality, the higher the relative capital intensity; and (v) factor prices are only partially
equalized8.
        Further, the model of Flam and Helpman (1987) considers the differences between the
qualities of the products are from technological differences between countries. In this case, the
most technologically advanced countries will specialize in exporting the highest quality
products, while the less technologically advanced countries will specialize in products of lower
quality.
          In the same line of Flam and Helpman (1987), Grossman and Helpman (1991) develop
a theoretical model of the product cycle, known in the literature as "quality ladder model". In
8
  This assumption avoids the problem of trade pattern indeterminacy, which occurs when having more factors
than final goods if factor prices are equalized (Bhagwati, 1972).
                                                                                                                    5

this model, the most technologically advanced countries use their comparative advantage in
innovation to develop new products of higher quality. After venturing into the market, these
new products are then copied by follower countries.

2.2. WHAT DOES THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE HAVE TO SAY?

          With the development and improvement of international trade data at more
disaggregated levels, empirical studies have emerged that examine not only the similarity of
the exports of the countries but also the intra-product specialization. For example, Hummels
and Klenow (2005) used a database composed of 126 exporting countries and 59 importing
countries, with trade flows disaggregated at six-digit Harmonized System. They find robust
evidence that countries with higher levels of per capita income export to a larger number of
products and penetrate their products on a larger number of markets at export prices slightly
higher than the competition. They assumed that product price reflects the quality. The authors
conclude that international trade specialization exists at the product level with the most
developed nations specializing in the production and exporting of the highest quality products,
while the less developed nations specializing in the production and exporting of lower quality
products.
          Using disaggregated U.S. import data at the level of 10-digit Harmonized System,
Schott (2006) observes that the U.S. imports the same products from different countries, but
product prices vary systematically according to the level of income of trading partners. In this
case, the evidence shows that product prices from rich countries are higher than those coming
from poor countries. Again it is assumed that the higher product price reflects its higher quality.
Schott argues that firms from capital abundant countries use their productivity advantage to
specialize in the production of higher quality products and mitigate competition with low
quality products from labor abundant countries.
          Following this logic, Fontagné et al. (2007) argue that competition between countries
can be reduced if exports are differentiated in quality. In examining the competition between
the European Union and China, based on the unit value of the products the authors divide the
trade flows in low, medium and high quality. In this case, the authors observed that the EU
exports are concentrated in the high quality segment, while China had a high share of exports
in the low quality market segment9. The authors conclude that European Union-China
competition is mitigated due to the form of product differentiation.
          Faruq (2010) found the quality of exported products to be directly related to research
and development activities, supporting the hypothesis of technological leadership models (Flam
and Helpman, 1987; Grossman and Helpman, 1991). Faruq also finds evidence that the quality
of products is determined by foreign direct investment, confirming the results of Reganati and
Pittiglio (2005) and Caetano and Gallego (2007). The foreign firm uses the investment to adopt
new technology, thus improving product quality.
          Krishna and Maloney (2011) analyzed the imports of the U. S. in the period 1990-2001
using unit values as proxies for product quality. They found that U.S. imports many of the same
products from different countries, even though there can be large differences in their unit values
(which are interpreted as differences in qualities). These imports are positively correlated with
the level of per capita income of the exporting country. They also argue that there is an intra-
product specialization in international trade, corroborating the results found in Hummels and
Klenow (2005) and Schott (2006). Moreover, Krishna and Maloney (2011) also identified that
the growth rate of the quality of products has increased over time, but differ across countries
where the highest rates are observed for the richer countries belonging to OECD.
          Kang and Lee (2012) study the relative quality of products traded between South
Korea and 15 OECD countries plus Taiwan. For the period 1996-2003. The authors used

    Paillacar and Zignago (2007) also conclude that the Chinese exports are concentrated on low quality products.

disaggregated bilateral trade flows for high quality and poor quality goods. They observed that
the quality of exported products from South Korea is inferior to the quality of the products
exported by the 15 OECD countries. Using panel data econometric methods, the authors found
that differences in the availability of physical capital tends to increase trade in vertically
differentiated products, supporting the central hypothesis of Falvey (1981) and Falvey and
Kierzkowski (1987).


3. METHODOLOGY

          The above literature shows that export specialization occurs in intra-product form,
which can be either either horizontally or vertically differentiated. When differentiated
vertically, competition among countries in the international market is reduced, given products
are designed for different market segments. Following this idea, this section describes the
methodology we use to investigate the competition between China and Brazil in the
MERCOSUR market. Following the theoretical models of Falvey (1981) and Falvey and
Kierzkowski (1987), does competition occur in differentiated products in variety or quality?
          The methods used in this paper are defined two fold. First, using the index of Finger
and Kreinin (1979), we identify the similarity of products exported by both Brazil and China to
MERCOSUR. Second, we characterize how product differentiation occurs, whether products
are differentiated horizontally or vertically.


3.1. MEASURING AND DECOMPOSITION OF THE EXPORT SIMILARITY INDEX

    The measurement of product similarity of exports from Brazil and China in the
MERCOSUR is performed through the Finger and Kreinin index:


                               ESI       =       min C        ;C                                           [1]


where,             denotes export similarity index of country i (Brazil) and country j (China), in
the market m (MERCOSUR), at time t;                is the share of product k, in the list of exports
from country i (Brazil), in the market m (MERCOSUR), at time t;             is the share of product
k, in the list of exports of country j (China), in market m (MERCOSUR), at time t.
          The export similarity index (ESI) varies in the interval between 0 and 1. When the
exports of country i (Brazil) and country j (China) have the same distribution, the index is equal
to one. When exports have completely different distributions, the index is equal to zero. An ESI
index close to unity can be an indication that the competition between China and Brazil in
MERCOSUR is quite fierce.
          In this paper we propose a way to decompose the index of Finger and Kreinin (1979)
to identify whether exports from Brazil and China to MERCOSUR occurs in horizontally or
vertically differentiated products. This decomposition will be based on the criterion of
similarity of products (Crespo and Fontoura, 2004), which is difined as the ratio of unit values
of product k exported by Brazil (VU ! ) and China (VU " ) for MERCOSUR10. If the ratio of unit

   The application of the criterion of similarity of products in the index of Finger and Kreinin (1979) is an
innovation of this paper, since most of the studies in the literature (Abd El-Rahman, 1991;. Greenaway et al, 1994;
Fontagné and Freudenberg, 1997; Durkin and Krygier, 2000; Nielsen and Lüthje, 2002; Crespo and Fontoura,
2004; Jensen and Lüthje, 2009) employ the criterion of similarity of products to obtain the disaggregated index of
Grubel and Lloyd (1975).
                                                                                                                         7

values11 [λ = VU ! #VU " ] is near the one, the products marketed by the countries do not have
significant differences and are considered horizontally differentiated. When the ratio of unit
values deviates too far from one, the products marketed have significant differences and are
considered vertically differentiated. The criteria used to define if λ is close or far from the unit
is the dispersion interval: [(1-α); (1 + α)]. Thus, when λ lies within this range the products are
horizontally differentiated; otherwise, they are vertically differentiated.
          When applying the criterion of product similarity, the the parameter α is very important
because it sets the way the products are marketed by different countries. Following Greenaway
et al. (1994), Durkin and Krygier (2000), Nielsen and Lüthje (2002), Crespo and Fontoura
(2004) and Jensen and Lüthje (2009), we use a dispersion factor (α) equal to 25 percent12. Thus,
the range for identifying the horizontal product differentiation is defined by: [0.75; 1.25]. If the
ratio of the unit values (λ) lies outside this range the products are considered vertically
differentiated.
          The similarity criterion further allows us to identify if the quality of the products
exported by Brazil are superior or inferior to the quality of products exported by China. In this
case, from Brazil’s perspective, the product quality is considered inferior or superior when λ <
(1-α) or λ > (1 + α), respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the differentiation of products according
to similarity.

         It is also important to note that the similarity criterion assumes that the unit value of
the product is a proxy for quality. According to Greenaway et al. (1994), the rationale for the
use of unit value as a proxy for quality derives from the assumption that consumers have perfect
information and are able to distinguish product quality. The good will have a higher quality
when the unit value is larger than the good of poorer quality. Stiglitz (1987) sbmits the unit

   According to the standard literature (Greenaway et al., 1994; Fontagné and Freudenberg, 1997; Schott, 2004;
Crespo and Fountoura, 2004; Fontagné et al., 2007; Jensen and Lüthje, 2009; Hiratuka and Cunha, 2011) the unit
value is calculated by the ratio between the trade value (V) and the trade quantity (Q), that is: VU = V/Q.

   Abd-el-Rahman (1991), Fontagné et al. (1997), and Jensen and Lüthje (2009) use a dispersion factor (α) equal
to 15%. According to Greenaway et al. (1995), the adoption of a dispersion factor equal to 15 percent will result
in a range of dispersion equal to 30 percent, which may be considered too narrow, if imperfect information prevails
in the market. Thus, the authors advocate the use of a dispersion factor of 25 percent, which provides a range of
dispersion equal to 50 percent; with such interval it is expected to cover information gaps that are due to the size
and diversity of the country (Zhang et al. 2005). Greenaway et al. (1995), Durkin and Krygier (2000), Crespo and
Fontoura (2004), and Jensen and Lüthje (2009) found no statistically significant differences between factors of
dispersion of 15 and 25 percent. However, despite all the care in choosing the dispersion factor, its definition still
has an arbitrary nature. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, see Davis and Weinstein (2001).

value (price) will have a positive relationship with product quality even when consumers do not
have perfect information13.
         Most product quality studies in the international trade literature are based on the
assumption that, at high level of disaggregation, relative prices reflect relative quality.
Greenaway et al. (1994). Fontagné et al. (1997) recognize that the direct association between
the unit price and the quality has limitations, because other factors, such as, market structures,
cost differences, differences in technology may affect the unit value of the product and, thus,
lead to an erroneous interpretation of quality. Fontagné et al. (2007) also point out that the
adoption of the unit value as a proxy for quality uses the restrictive hypothesis that productivity
is homogeneous across countries, following the assumptions described in Jones (1974) and
Deardorff (1979). Despite these limitations, Fontagné et al. (2007) argue that at the empirical
point of view, the quality that distinguishes exported products are present in unit values,
supporting the plausibility that the unit value of the product is a reasonable proxy for quality.
         After applying the criterion of product similarity, the export similarity index (ESI)
described in equation [1] can be decomposed:


                                   ESI      = ESI$      + ESI&                                         [2]
            or:
                                                                    &'*+,
                            ESI     = ESI$      + ESI&'( ) + ESI                                       [3]


         Thus, the export similarity index (ESI) between countries i (Brazil) and j (China), in
the market m (MERCOSUR), at time t, is the sum of the similarity index of exports in
                                           -

(               ) and vertical superior (            ). These definitions are elaborated in Table 1.

3.2. DATASET

         The index of Finger and Kreinin (1979) of equation (1) is sensitive to the level of trade
data disaggregation. The index tends to be higher the higher the level of aggregation. Therefore,
to enable us to achieve our objectives, we use trade data disaggregated at six-digit level of the
Harmonized System, which includes more than 5,000 products. These data come from the Base
pour l'Analyse du Commerce International (BACI), which is published by the Centre d'Etudes
Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales (CEPII) and is available for download at:
http://www.cepii. fr / anglaisgraph / bdd / baci.htm. These data cover the period 2008 to 2017.
         The use of the database BACI has an advantage over other databases of international
trade, such as COMTRADE. While most databases report exports on FOB value (free on board)
and imports on CIF value (Cost, Insurance and Freight), in BACI, the monetary values of
exports and imports are supported on a FOB-FOB base, considering CIF costs were estimated
and removed from the values of imports. For details of the BACI dataset, see Gaulier and
Zignago (2010).
         It is important to recognize that the use of trade data at the six-digit level, while
extremely disaggregated, has at least one potential problem. Baldwin (2006) refers to the fact
that these data do not measure the total number of products exported by individual countries,
given that a large number of products must be comprehended under the same category of the
Harmonized System. Thus, it is possible that the values we obtain will overestimate the true
degree of export similarity Brazil and China to MERCOSUR. Despite this limitation, we
believe that the data used here can provide a good picture of the trade competitiveness of Brazil
and China in MERCOSUR.


4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1. BRAZILIAN AND CHINESE EXPORTS TO MERCOSUR FROM 2009 TO 2017

         Before analyzing export competitiveness, we present an overview Brazil and China
exports to MERCOSUR during the period 2008-2017. Throughout the period Brazil’s exports
are higher than those of China, but their difference is getting smaller over time (see Figure 2).
For instance, in 2008, China's exports to MERCOSUR was only 31.5 percent of Brazilian
exports to that market, but in 2017 this figure exceeded 56.5 percent, reflecting the rising share
of Chinese products in MERCOSUR14.




14
   A fact which contributed to greater integration of China in MERCOSUR was the entry of China into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.

         The sectoral composition of exports from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR is shown
in Table 2, noting that the numbers are average percentages for the sub-periods of 2008/2010
and 2015/2017. For Brazil in both periods 2008/2010 and 2015/2017, exports were concentrated
in the sectors: Transportation, Machines/Electrical, Mineral products and Chemicals, which
together accounted for around 69.6 percent and 69.2 percent of Brazilian exports to
MERCOSUR in the two periods, respectively. Brazil's exports to MERCOSUR have become
more concentrated over time, largely driven by the transportation sector. Similarly, in the first
sub-period China's exports to MERCOSUR were concentrated in Machinery/Electric, Textiles,
Transoirtation and Chemicals, which collectively represent around 75 percent of exports.
However, by the latter sub-period China’s exports were focused on the same sectors and, to a
lesser extent Miscellaneous Products, accounting for 82.7 percent of China's exports to
MERCOSUR. Like Brazil, there was also an increase in the concentration of China's exports in
MERCOSUR over time. However, in China’s case this increase was largely driven by the
transportation and miscellaneous products sectors.

          The number of products exported by Brazil and China to MERCOSUR (at six-digit
Harmonized System) is reported in Table 3. The number of products exported by Brazil to
MERCOUSR dropped from 3,454 in 2008 to 3,417 in 2014. After 2015, a slight recovery in
the total number of products exported by Brazil, reaching 3,541 in 2017.
          In China's case, the total number of products exported to MERCOSUR showed an
increasing trend, from 2,901 products in 2008 to 3,121 products in 2011. After a slight decrease
in 2012-13, the total number of products exported reached 3,266 in 2017. While China added
365 products to its MERCOSUR export list, from 2008 to 2017, Brazil saw an increase of only
87 products over the same period.
          In Table 3 we also show that the products simultaneously exported (same products) by
both countries increased from 2,469 in 2008 to 2,754 in 2017. After a slight decrease in 2009
and 2012, the number of products simultaneously exported increased after 2013. It is interesting
to note that in 2017, 77.8 percent of products exported by Brazil were also exported by China,
up from 71 percent in 2008. This suggests increasing product competition in MERCOSUR.

         In Table 4 we present the average number of products exported to MERCOSUR by
Brazil, China, and simultaneously by sector, for the periods 2008-2010 and 2015-2017. Both
countries are focusing their exports on the Machinery/Electric, Metals, Textiles and Chemicals
sectors. An interesting observation is that, between periods of 2008-2010 and 2015-2017, China
increased the number of products exported in all sectors, except for the footwear sector, while
Brazil showed small increases in some sectors, mainly for Transportation, Mineral Products
and Textiles.
         For the Machinery/Electric, Miscellaneous products, Textiles, Footwear and
Stone/Glass sectors, the number of products exported by China exceeded the number of
products exported by Brazil in 2015-2017. As increasing Chinese penetration in MERCOSUR
occurred in virtually every sector, the products simultaneously exported by Brazil and China
for MERCOSUR also increased.

        Between 2008-2017 China increased its exports to MERCOSUR and this increase has
been accompanied by a rise in the total number of products sold. With the increase of the
number of products simultaneously exported, the export basket of China in MERCOSUR has
become increasingly similar to Brazil. A closer analysis of the extent of the similarity of exports
from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR will be performed in the next section by computing the
ISE index.


4.2. EXPORT SIMILARITY INDEX (ESI)

         We now further quantify the similarities of products exported from Brazil and China
in MERCOSUR. This is done in two steps. In the first step we compute product similarity
indices at the aggregate level, all trade between Brazil and China with MERCOSUR. In the
second, we compute disaggregated indices by sector.


4.2.1. Agregate analysis

          The evolution of the export similarity index (ESI) of Brazil and China in MERCOSUR
over the period 2008-2017 is shown in Figure 3. It is unmistakable that exports from Brazil and
China have become increasingly similar over time, as the ESI index is increasing. From the
initial year (2008) to the final year (2017), the index increased from 0.19 to 0.20, or 7.8 percent.

         The evidence found here is different from that found by Filgueiras and Kume (2010)
in the North American market. These authors found the similarity of exports between Brazil
and China in the North American market first increased from 0.11 to 0.15, between the years
2000 to 2005, then decreased to 0.1015 in 2008, virtually no change over the entire period. In
Figure 3 we can see a slight increasing trend. This could well indicate that the competition
between China and Brazil in MERCOSUR has become stronger over time, but at lower pace
than showed in previous studies, such as Carmo et al. (2014).
         We argued earlier that the competition between Brazil and China can be smoothed if
the traded products are vertically differentiated. This may be the situation here as the same
products may be sold in different market segments, according to Fontagné et al. (2007). Thus
we decompose the ESI into horizontal and vertical differentiated components, ESIH and ESIV.

   The data used by Filgueiras and Kume (2010) to calculate the similarity of exports from Brazil and China in the
North American market were more disaggregated from those used in this study. While these authors used data
disaggregated at 10-digit level, in the present study the data are disaggregated to six-digit level. Thus, as noted in
subsection 3.2, more disaggregated data tend to provide lower values of the ISE index than more aggregated data.

         In Table 5 export similarity occurs mainly in vertically differentiated products
(products with different qualities), as the ESIV represents more than 70 percent of the ESI over
the entire 2008-2017 period. Thus, product competition between Brazilian and Chinese
products in MERCOSUR has been attenuated, since the products simultaneously exported are
directed toward different market segments.
         Whereas vertically differentiated products possess different qualities, in Table 6 we
compute indices to see if the quality of products exported by Brazil are superior or inferior to
those exported by China.

         In Table 6, it is apparent that when products simultaneously exported by Brazil and
China possess different qualities, the quality of Brazilian products is larger than the quality of
Chinese products. These data are consistent with the results observed in Filgueiras and Kume
(2010) in the North American market, and Carmo et al (2014) for Brazilian and Chinese exports
to MERCOSUR, where these studies also found the quality of products exported by Brazil to
be higher than the quality of products exported by China.
         According to the neo-Hecksher-Ohlin (Falvey, 1981; Falvey and Kierzowski, 1987),
the quality of exported products is directly linked to the capital-labor ratio of the countries. The
country with the larger capital-labor ratio will export a higher quality product to the country
with a lower capital/labor ratio. Therefore, the relatively higher quality of Brazilian exports is
attributed to the relatively higher capital-labor ratio of Brazil16. These results are in consonance
with other studies which also found the existence of a intra-product trade specialization
(Hummels and Klenow, 2005; Shott, 2006).
         In sum, we find that the similarity of exports from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR
has increased over time, suggesting that competition between countries in that market is
increasingly getting stronger. However, this competition has softened a bit since a high portion
of the exported products are vertically differentiated. We further observe product quality
differences; the quality of Brazilian products exported to MERCOSUR is higher than those
from China.

  Based on World Bank data, Filgueira and Kume (2010) report that in 2008 per capita income in Brazil was US$
10,070 while in China it was US$ 6,020. The rationale for the use of per capita income as a proxy for capital/labor
ratio is the following: consider that Y = F (K, L), where Y denotes GDP, K is the amount of physical capital, (.) L
denotes the number of workers and F is a smooth function of degree one. Thus, by dividing both sides by the
function L, we get: y = f (k); where y = Y/L and k = K/L.

          In Table 7, we see how export similarity between Brazil and China has changed over
time. The highest similarity occurs in the Footwear industry, reaching a magnitude of 0.65 for
the period 2011-2014 and 2015-201717. Ranking second in 2008-2010, the Plastic/Rubber
industry saw a continuous rise in the ESI reaching 0.44. Other sectors that showed continuous
increase in similarity over time were Food products and Timber. All sectors in Table 7 show
increases over time, with the exception of Stone/Glass sector. The lowest ESI are for those
sectors producing primary goods (Animal and animal products and vegetable products) and
sectors that are intensive in natural resources (Mineral products). This is plausible since the list
of exports from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR focus mostly on manufactured products, as
seen earlier in Table 2.
          We now desaggregate the ESI in ESIH and ESIV for each of the fifteen sectors. These
results are reported in Table 8 as the mean percentages for the sub-periods: 2008-2010, 2011-
2014 and 2015-2017. For the majority of sectors, the ESI occurs in vertically differentiated
products, given that the ESIV is larger than the ESIH. However, the ESIH increases in the last
sub-period for Timber sector. This may suggest that the quality of Brazilian and Chinese
products in this sector have recently become more similar. In the case of Animal and animal
products, however, the similarity changed over time from vertically to horizontally
differentiated products.

         In Table 9 we see if the quality of the Brazilian exports is superior or inferior to the
quality of the Chinese exports when they are vertically differentiated. Because ESIV-Sup. is larger
than the ESIV-Inf. the quality of products exported by Brazil is superior to the quality of Chinese
products in most industries. However, in some sectors the ESIV-Inf. is larger than ESIV-Sup. such
as Animals, Food, and Mineral products. Specifically in the case of Animals and Mineral
products, there has been a change in the pattern of product differentiation between the
subperiods. Although the export similarity index (ESI) in these sectors are very low (as in Table
7), product quality can be strongly influenced by the behavior of a single product, making the
quality measurement less stable.

       In the sectoral analysis, it was possible to verify that most of the results has the same
trend as showed by Carmo et al. (2014) for the period 1995-2009. Therefore, even after the
period of the boom in the commodities’ prices, there were some changes in the sectors’
competitiveness in the Brazilian and Chinese exports to MERCOSUR, which might be a sign
of other factors than export prices.

5. FINAL COMMENTS

          The rapid growth in China’s participation in international product markets over the
past couple decades has impacted exporters competing in similar markets. In particular, exports
from China to MERCOUSR may threaten Brazilian exports, especially when the exported
products are similar. However, Fontagné et al. (2007) finds that competition between countries
can be mitigated if the exported products are vertically differentiated.
          In this paper we investigate the competitiveness of exports from Brazil and China in
MERCOSUR over the period 2008 to 2017. We measure the similarity of their exports to using
the index (ESI) proposed by Finger and Kreinin (1979). The further decomposition of the index
enables us to identify product quality. Thus we are able to find out if the quality of Brazilian
exports is superior or inferior to the quality of Chinese exports to MERCOSUR.
          Using disaggregated trade data at the six-digit level of the Harmonized System, our
results suggest that the similarity of exports from Brazil and China in MERCOSUR has
increased over time, ESI moving from 0.19 (in 2008) to 0.20 (in 2017). Thus, export
competition between the two countries has become stronger.
          Through ESI decomposition, we found that the similarity of exports occurs mostly in
vertically differentiated products, where the quality of the products exported by Brazil is greater
than the quality of the products exported by China. Our findings are consistent with trade
models of the "Falvey" type, which show countries with a higher relative abundance of capital
will produce goods of superior quality to those produced by countries with a higher relative
abundance of labor.
          Despite increasing exports by both Brazil and China to MERCOSUR, Brazil has
increased its relative share of high value added (quality) export products. As Brazil seeks to add
value to its MERCOSUR exports, the China’s increased presence may not be in direct
competiton with Brazil.
