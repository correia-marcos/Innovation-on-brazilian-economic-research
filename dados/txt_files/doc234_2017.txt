ABSTRACT
Hospitalizations for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSH) are health conditions for which
hospitalization can be avoided if primary care is provided in a timely and effective manner. ACSH
account for more than half of all hospital admissions among children under five years old in Brazil.
The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of primary care physicians (PCPs) on
hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions among children under five years old in
Brazilian municipalities. Spatial dynamic panel data model was estimated using municipality data
over a period of eight years from 2005 to 2012. The regression includes two spatial variables, hospital
beds and PCPs, which allow spatial interactions between neighboring units. The results indicate that
primary care physician supply contributed to the decline of ACSH among children. Spillover effects
associated with hospital beds and number of PCPs are relevant in explaining ACSH among children.
These show that there are regional benefits beyond the municipality of observation.

RESUMO
Internações por Condições Sensíveis à Atenção Primária (ICSAP) são doenças e agravos de saúde
cuja hospitalização são potencialmente evitáveis diante de um nível de atenção básico efetivo e
oportuno. No Brasil, as ICSAP correspondem por mais da metade de todas as internações hospitalares
entre crianças menores de cincos anos. Nesse sentido, o presente estudo tem como objetivo analisar
o efeito do aumento no número dos médicos da atenção básica na taxa de hospitalização por condições
sensíveis à atenção primária entre crianças menores de cinco anos nos municípios brasileiros. Para
tanto, foi estimado um modelo de dados em painel dinâmico espacial para o período de 2005-2012.
Duas variáveis espaciais foram incluídas, número de médicos da atenção básica e leitos hospitalares.
Os resultados indicam que o aumento do número de médicos da atenção básica contribuiu para a
redução das ICSAP entre crianças. Além disso, as variáveis espaciais também foram significantes
para explicar as ICSAP, indicando a existência de benefícios regionais além do município de
observação.

1 INTRODUCTION

         The patterns of hospitalizations provide useful information to determine health problems
related to primary care (CASANOVA et al., 1996). In recent decades, hospitalization for ambulatory
care sensitive conditions (ACSH) has been extensively used as an indicator to evaluate the
accessibility and effectiveness in the delivery of primary care (ANSARI et al., 2006). This indicator,
also called potentially preventable hospitalization, is based on the knowledge that adequate care might
reduce the occurrence of disease and consequently decrease the need for hospital admission. The term
of ambulatory care sensitive (ACS) conditions was developed by Billings et al. (1993) to denote
health conditions for which hospitalization can be avoided if primary care is provided in a timely and
effective manner. The lower risk of hospitalization is related to prevention, control and management
of the disease or condition.
         There are two empirical approaches using ACSH indicator (ANSARI et al., 2006). First, the
relationship between ACSH and access to health care is analysed by the effects of physician supply.
This approach has as assumption that access is positively associated with supply. The second
examines the relationship between ACSH and self-rated access to health care. Both approaches has
been empirically confirmed.
         In recent years, evidence of the physician supply on ACSH rate has been accumulating in
diverse groups, such as among adults (LIN et al., 2016; RIZZA et al., 2007; ROSANO et al., 2016),
children (FRIEDMAN; BASU, 2001; GUTTMANN et al., 2010) and by specific disease (WALKER
et al., 2014). Laditka et al. (2005) evaluated the effects of PCP on ACSH rates for children, younger
adults and middle adults. They found the number of physicians associated with lower ACSH in all
age groups, with largest contributor of PCP to ACHS among children.
         In Brazil, children’s health has received priority attention (PEDRAZA; ARAUJO, 2017).
Some of the preventable diseases, such as acute disease, occur predominantly during the early years
of life (CARVALHO et al., 2015; MOURA et al., 2010; PAZÓ et al., 2012). In addition to other
avoidable comorbidities, they represent a high proportion of hospitalization and mortality among
children under five years old. In 2012, ACSHs accounted for around half of all hospital admissions
among children under five years old in Brazil (DATASUS, 2017). Children were predominantly
admitted for pneumonia, intestinal infections (other), gastroenteritis and colitis of infectious origin,
asthma, and acute bronchitis and acute bronchiolitis.
         In view of the high ACSH rates in Brazil, the Ministry of Health elaborated the Brazilian list
of hospitalization due to primary care sensitive conditions in 2008 (ALFRADIQUE et al., 2009;
MINISTRY OF HEALTH, 2008). Since then several studies have emerged on this topic. In general,
these studies have analysed the time trend and causes of ACSH. There are few studies using
longitudinal data, especially for ACSH among children. We identified two studies that evaluated the
effect of primary care on ACHS among children in Brazil. The first one restricts the analysis to one
Brazilian state, Pernambuco State (CARVALHO et al., 2015). Second study assess a specific disease,
pneumonia (PAMPONET, 2014). Both studies use a negative binomial model and show the effective
of primary care in reducing hospitalization rate. However, these studies don’t evaluate the effect of
overall PCP on ACSH.
         In order to evaluate the effect of increasing PCP on ACSH rates among children under five
years old in Brazilian municipalities, we use a robust approach, spatial dynamic panel data model,
for a period of eight years from 2005 to 2012. Dynamic panel data model accounts for endogeneity
and unobserved municipality-specific effects, furthermore, it improves the accuracy of estimates
when the dependent variable is persistent over time. The model also includes two spatial variables,
hospital beds and PCPs, which allow spatial interactions between neighboring units. These variables
identify the spatial spillovers effects of hospital beds and PCPs on municipal hospitalization rate.
2 DATA AND METHOD

2.1 Data

        The study follows a balanced panel of 3,846 municipalities in Brazil over a period of 8 years
from 2005 to 2012. The study focuses on hospital admission, therefore, only municipalities with
hospital beds are included in the main analysis. ACSH rate is defined as the number of hospitalization
for ambulatory care sensitive conditions under five years old per 1,000 population under five years
old. The definition of ambulatory care condition follows the Ordinance SAS/MS No. 221, of April
17, 2008. Based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the Ministry of Health
elaborated the Brazilian list for ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations. This list was created, after
extensive discussion, as a tool for measuring the Brazilian health system performance. Table A1, in
Appendix, reports the Brazilian list for ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations and the codes used.
        In addition the density of primary care physician, defined as the total number of PCPs per
10,000 population, a set of variables known to be associated with child health was included in the
analyses as covariates: other FHS team per 10,000 population, hospital beds per 10,000 population,
percentage of female illiteracy, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, area density, percentage
of household with sewage and percentage of household with trash collection.
        The data are mainly taken from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (DATASUS – Department
of the SUS). Primary care physician and other FHS team are collected using TabWin – program
developed by DATASUS/Ministry of Health. Primary care physician, other FHS team and hospital
beds are from National Registry of Health Facilities (CNES).
Hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions is obtained from the Hospital Information
System of the Unified Health System (SIH/SUS). Data on GDP, area and population are obtained
from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Data on trash collection and sewage
are taken from National Census Bureau. The data on female illiteracy is based on the Annual List of
Social Information (RAIS) from the Ministry for Labor and Employment (MTE); this data is only
available for female workers in the formal sector.
        Annual values for all variables are available from the database, except for household facilities.
Linear interpolation is used to estimate annual values of trash collection and sewage for the period
2005 to 2009. The estimates are based on the National Census for 2000 and 2010. For the posterior
period, 2011 and 2012, linear extrapolation is used based on the same function.
        In this paper, primary care physicians are measured using the sum of the hours worked per
week of FHS physicians, community physicians, general practitioners (GPs), general pediatricians
and gynecologists/obstetricians who work in healthcare centers (healthcare centers include Centro de
Saúde/Unidade Básica de Saúde, Posto de Saúde and Centro de Apoio a Saúde da Família – CASF).
Healthcare centers are designed to provide primary health care to the population and they concentrate
primary health teams. Physicians working in hospitals are not included. The total number of PCPs is
calculate dividing the total hours worked per week by 40. The professionals work, in general, 40
hours per week. This measure allows more accuracy to compare the availability of physicians among
municipalities, since the physicians may present diverse workload in Brazil.
        Other FHS team include nurses and nurses assistant. Nurses of FHS are included as covariate
based on their relevant role for primary care and infant health (SANTOS; MIRANDA, 2007;
SAPAROLLI; ADAMI, 2007). The total number of other FHS team is calculate dividing the total
hours worked per week by 40.

        The Pearson correlation matrix shows that there is a highly positive correlation between PCP
and Other FHS team, ranging between 0.68 and 0.73 in the period. This occurs because a large portion
of the PCPs make up the FHS team. Percentage of household with sewage and with trash collection
also indicate a high correlation (Table 4).

2.3 Method


       In this section, we describe the empirical approach to identify the effects of PCPs on ACSH
rates among children under five years old. We estimated a dynamic equation, which can be written
as:
                     ACSHit = δACSHit-1 + γPCPit + β’Xit + λt + ηi + εit                   (1)

        The dynamic models can be estimated using Difference and System Generalized Method of
Moments (GMM) estimators. Roodman (2009) compares both estimators and argues that System
GMM is more appropriate for applications with persistent series - as our case. Therefore, we use the
System GMM estimator for dynamic panel models developed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and
Blundell and Bond (1998).
        The literature demonstrates that the estimation of equation (1) using pooled OLS and fixed
effect will potentially lead to biased and inconsistent results. According Nickell (1981), estimations
using pooled OLS with lagged dependent variable violate the orthogonality condition. The
assumption of OLS that the error is uncorrelated with the regressors is needed for the validity of
estimates, which means the estimator may be inconsistent and biased. In other words, the correlation
between ηit and imit-1 or Xit is very likely not to be zero.
        The fixed effects model treats the municipality specific effects producing unbiased and
consistent estimators. However, the fixed effects estimator requires strict exogeneity and it is not hold
in models with dynamic dependent variable (WOOLDRIDGE, 2001). As a result, the assumptions
required for estimation of the model are also violated.
        Difference and System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) are estimators developed to
dynamic panel models. There are popular for avoiding dynamic panel bias and handling with fixed
effects and endogeneity of regressor (ROODMAN, 2009).
        Initially, Arellano and Bond (1991) suggested the difference GMM estimator. This estimator
includes the lagged levels of the explanatory variables as instruments and eliminates the fixed
municipality specific effect by estimating the equation (1) in first differences

                      Δimit = δΔimit-1 + γΔPCPit + β’ΔXit + Δλt + Δεit                     (2)

where Δimit = imit - imit-1. Since Δimit-1 and Δεit are correlated by definition, the OLS estimate is
inconsistent. Later, Blundell and Bond (1998) showed that the GMM estimator obtained after first
differencing is likely to perform poorly when the number of time periods is moderately small and the
autoregressive parameter is moderately large. In such a case lagged levels of the series provide weak
instruments for first differences. In order to address this problem, Blundell and Bond (1998) proposed
the System GMM, a system of regressions in differences and levels, where the instruments used for
the levels are lagged first-differences of the explanatory variables.
        In order to allow spatial interactions between neighboring municipalities, the estimates
include two spatial variables, hospital beds and number of PCPs. The spatial dynamic equation can
be represented as:

        ACSHit = δACSHit-1 + γPCPit + β’Xit + φW.PCPit + ωW.HBit + λt + ηi + εit           (3)

where ACSHit is the hospitalization rates for ambulatory care sensitive conditions of municipality i at
year t; imit-1 denotes the lagged infant mortality rate and it is included to capture persistence in infant
mortality; PCPit is the density of primary care physicians; Xit contains a set of explanatory variables;
HBit is the density of hospital beds; W denotes the spatial weight matrix; λt indicate the unobserved
time-specific effect controlling for common shocks to the infant mortality rate of all municipalities;
ηi is the unobserved municipality-specific effect; and εit denotes the error term.
         The System GMM estimator generates numerous instruments. There are two sorts of problems
caused by the instrument proliferation (ROODMAN, 2009). First, the numbers of instruments can
overtif the number of endogenous variables, just as known for applications using instrumental
variable. The second problem refers the feasible efficient GMM, given that an optimal weighting
matrix for the determining moments between instruments and errors is estimated using sample
moments. As a result, the GMM estimator makes some asymptotic results and weakened specification
tests. One way to deal with this problem is to collapse the instruments and limit the lag depth, as
suggested by (ROODMAN, 2009). We follow this approach.


3 RESULTS

3.1 Dynamic panel model

        Table 5 reports estimates for the effects of PCP on ACSH among children under five years
old, equation (1), using OLS, random effects, fixed effects and System GMM. The regressions include
a full set of variables known to be associated with child health, as well as year dummies. All
estimations use robust standard errors.
        The lagged dependent variable, hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions
(ACSHt-1), indicates a high degree of persistence in the ACSH among children over time, except after
accounting for fixed effect which coefficient is small in magnitude. Column (1), (2) and (4) show that
the coefficient on the number of PCPs is negative and statistically significant. It indicates that a rise
in PCPs density leads to a decline in preventable hospitalization among children. Number of hospital
beds is positively associated with hospitalization rate. The effects of other FHS team are not
consistent over the four different estimation models, since the coefficients produce mixed evidence.

       Nickell (1981) pointed out that models estimated by OLS using panel data and including
individual fixed effects produces asymptotic biases. In addition, Arellano and Bover (1995) and
Blundell and Bond (1998) argue that, since lagged dependent variable exhibit a high degree of
persistence, System GMM estimator is more appropriate. Thus, the following tables use GMM
estimators.
         The System GMM is consistent if the instruments are valid and there is no second order serial
correlation. The validity of instruments is tested using the Hansen/Sargan test of over-identifying
restrictions. The instruments are valid if the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. First-order, second-
order and third-order serial correlation are tested using AR1, AR2 and AR3 statistics. The System
GMM estimator is consistent if there is no significant AR(2) serial correlation of the residuals. If we
cannot reject the serial correlation of order 2, deeper lags should be used. We use only lags starting
at depth 3, since there is no evidence, at the 10% significance level, for no second-order serial
correlation. As shown in table 6, all estimations present valid instrument and there is no evidence for
significant AR(3) serial correlation of the residuals. Different specifications using System GMM are
presented in order to test the sensitivity of the results to including additional controls.
         The results show a negative and statistically significant effect of PCPs on ACSH among
children. This finding is robust across all considered specification. The last column (column (6))
indicates that an increase of one PCP per 10,000 population is associated with 4.5 fewer children
hospitalization per 1,000 population under five years old. All specifications of the model find a
positive and statistically significant coefficient on other FHS team. In order to explore the relationship
of theses variables, we estimated a new specification only including “other of FHS team” as
independent variable (Table A1). It was estimated with and without year dummies. The results
confirmed the positive association between other workers of FHS team and ACSH using fixed effects
and OLS. A negative association between theses variables was found only in estimations without year
dummies.
         Column (2) add hospital beds. The coefficient is positive and statistically significant. As
expected, it shows that municipalities with more hospital beds is associated with more hospitalization.
         The percentage of female illiteracy, column (3), was not statistically significant, even though
the coefficient had the expected sign. Additional estimations showed a positive relationship between
female illiteracy and ACSH (Table A2). However, it was statistically significant only for
specifications without year dummies.
         Column (4) adds the GDP per capita. The variable has a negative and statistically significant
effect on hospitalization. The column (6) include household facilities. The results show that
percentage of households with sewage and trash collection are negatively associated with ACSH
among children. This is also the most complete specification and all the coefficients and the p-values
remain relatively similar.

3.1 Spatial dynamic panel model

         The analyses of hospitalization rate may be affected by neighboring municipalities. The
density of hospital beds and the density of PCPs of the neighbourhood are expected to impact the
population’s health. Thus, it is relevant to perform a diagnostic of spatial dependence of these
variables.
         Table 7 shows the Moran’s I statistic and it confirms the spatial correlation of PCPs and
hospital beds. The results indicate that is possible to reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness
at the significance level of 1%. The Moran scatterplots indicate positive spatial correlation. In general,
positive spatial correlation denotes that municipalities with high (low) value of the variable tend to
be surrounded by high (low) value of this variable in the neighboring municipalities.
        The analysis of Moran’s I statistic suggest to use the 8-nearest neighbors to define the spatial
weight matrix.

       Table 8 reports the estimate using spatial dynamic panel data, equation (2). The estimate
includes two spatial variables, hospital beds and number of PCPs, which allow spatial interactions
between neighboring units. Both variables are relevant in explaining ACSH among children. The
signs of the coefficients are consistent with the variables considering the effects of the units. They
show that number of hospital beds in the neighborhood is positively linked to hospitalization, whereas
number of PCPs in the neighborhood is negatively linked to preventable hospitalization.

       In addition, we estimated the equation (2) including all Brazilians municipalities (Table 9).
The previous results are based on municipalities that have at least one hospital bed. Municipalities
without hospital beds were dropped from the estimations since the non-local availability of hospital
beds could reduce the number of hospitalization even when it is necessary. Table 8 reports the results

        The number of PCPs is negatively associated with the hospitalization for ambulatory care
sensitive conditions among children (Table 9). After including all municipalities, the coefficient of
hospital beds is no longer statistically significant. However, the number of hospital beds in the
neighbourhood is positive and statistically significant. Other control variables, GDP per capita,
sewage and trash collection still remain relevant in explaining hospitalization. The lagged dependent
variable evidences the high degree of persistence in the preventable hospitalization among children
in Brazilian municipalities. The tests show that the instruments are valid and there is no third order
serial correlation in the residuals.


4 DISCUSSION

         The association between primary care and health outcomes is well described in the literature,
including for children (STARFIELD et al., 2005). In this study, the results show the effect of primary
care physicians on preventable hospitalization among children under five years old. This relationship
remains significant after controlling for various socioeconomic characteristics. Additionally, this
study uses a robust methodological approach, spatial dynamic panel data, and a longitudinal database.
         Previous studies have showed that infants with at least the recommended number of doctor
visits by The American Academy of Pediatrics had a lower adjusted rate of emergency department
visits and hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (HAKIM; BYE, 2001; PITTARD
et al., 2007). Similar result was showed by Ladikta et al. (2005), which increase PCP by one standard
deviation reduces the ACSH rate by 0.239 standard deviations. The relationship between primary
care and ACSH rates have also been evaluated by conditions. Monahan et al. (2013) found that
gastroenteritis hospitalization rates were associated with increasing coverage of primary care in
Bahia, Northeast Brazil. Pamponet (2014) showed the negative effect of primary care on
hospitalization rate for pneumonia in Brazilian municipalities. Both studies, Monahan et al. (2013)
and Pamponet (2014) are longitudinal analyses and use fixed effects. These conditions, gastroenteritis
and pneumonia, are among the most common hospital admissions of children. Our results provides
additional evidence of a negative association between the number of primary care physicians and
children health. The results indicated that the increase of PCPs lead to lower rates of hospitalization
for ambulatory care sensitive conditions among children.
         Hospital beds indicated a positive and significant effect on ACSH. This results was expect
since municipalities with more hospital beds may record a higher number of admissions
(DELAMATER et al., 2013). The association between the number of hospital beds and higher
hospitalization is well-know, as showed by Lugo-Palacios and Cairns (2015), Carvalho et al. (2015),
Macinko et al. (2011). Table 9 shows that after considering all municipalities, with and without
hospital beds, the municipal number of hospital beds is no longer significant to explain
hospitalization. These results confirm that geographical accessibility is a relevant component of
access to hospital. Individuals are more discouraged by long travel times for health service and tend
to seek for other nearest provides (LUO; WANG, 2003).
         In terms of spatial effects, the results indicate that the numbers of hospital beds and PCPs in
the neighborhood are associated with ACSH. The number of hospital beds of the surrounding areas
is positively associated with the total number of hospitalization. It indicates that even that the
individuals tend to settle for health services in nearby locations, the availability of this services in the
neighborhood is relevant. Similar result is found for PCP, the coefficient is negatively related to
ACSH. These finds suggest that the population mobility to nearby areas is a relevant factor to health
care access.
         Hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions are found related to GDP per capita
in both developed and developing countries (MAFRA, 2010; ROSANO et al., 2013). Even though
income level and income inequalities are important variables to explain preventable hospitalization
rate (AGABITI et al., 2009), Preston (1975) argues that national income is possibly the best indicator
of living standards in a country. Once national income includes all final products, which may
influence health’s variables, this indicator is more appropriate than on another socioeconomic
variable.
         The estimations include two variables related to household facilities, sewage and trash
collection. They are widely associated by the literature with some preventable diseases. Diarrhea,
gastroenteritis, leptospirosis, poliomyelitis and salmonellosis are examples of diseases caused by
untreated sewage or sewage contaminated water (ASHBOLT, 2004; PAYMENT et al., 1991). On the
other hand, garbage burning is one important source of pollution. The environmental pollution of
waste dumping can have health effects of short and long-term, including congenital anomalies,
asthma, respiratory infection, headache, and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (MATTIELLO
et al., 2013; TRIASSI et al., 2015). Our results show that only trash collection had the expected sign.
This may occur due to dependent variable, hospitalization, include all preventable disease, and not
only diseases identified as being associated with household facilities.
         It is noteworthy that two variable did not show the expected result. First, we expected that the
number of other workers of FHS team was negatively associated with ACSH. The results show a
positive relationship between them. Previous literature has indicated the inverse association between
hospitalization and FHS in Brazil (CECCON et al., 2014; MACINKO et al., 2011). Additional results
showed a negative association between these variables only in estimations without year dummies.
Even estimates including FHS coverage (instead of other FHS team) showed positive sign after
including year dummies. All cited studies for ACSH in Brazil don’t include year dummies. Second,
female illiteracy also was expected to be found with positive sign and significant. Although the sign
is consistent with expected, it is not statistically significant. Additional estimations indicated a
positive and statically significant relationship between illiteracy and ACSH only for specifications
without year dummies. These three results, other FHS team, FHS coverage and female illiteracy,
reveal that after control for year effects they didn’t show the expected sign. All year dummies in all
models were statically significant at the 1% level, which indicate the relevance of capturing aggregate
trends.


5 CONCLUSIONS

       The Brazilian policy regarding public health system has given substantial importance to
primary care in recent decades, potentially providing lessons for other developing countries. The
objective of this study has been to investigate the relationship between number of primary care
physicians in local areas and hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions among children
under five years old. The results suggest that primary care physicians play an important role in
accounting for the reduction of hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive condition among
children. In addition, spatially lagged variables indicate that there is a spatial spillover related to
hospital beds and number of PCPs.
