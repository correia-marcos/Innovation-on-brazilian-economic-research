         China’s accession to the WTO has shifted international trade and the literature on its impact in
other countries’ exports is still scant. This paper aims to contribute to this literature by investigating the
impact of Chinese expansion in the international trade in the exports of three Latin American (LA)
countries: Brazil, Mexico and Peru. Considering developed and developing countries as destinations
from these LA countries, results suggest that these three countries were affected by the insertion of
China in the international trade. Overall, firms of these three countries lost 5.7% of their exports to the
US and 7.2% to the EU due to China expansion. In terms of volume, these three countries lost USD 9
billion dollars of exports just in the US market. Comparing the outcomes between countries, Brazil
seems to be the most affected compared to Mexico and Peru in relative terms. Looking at the margins
and types of goods, final goods suffered more from the Chinese competition compared to
intermediaries, yet it is not feasible to distinguish which margin, intensive or extensive, was mostly
affected.

        A entrada da China à OMC mudou o comércio mundial e a literatura sobre seus impactos
permanece escassa. Esse artigo visa contribuir para essa literatura ao investigar o impacto da expansão
chinesa no comércio internacional nas exportações de três países da América Latina: Brasil, México e
Peru. Considerando países desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento como destinos das exportações desses
três países, os resultados sugerem que os mesmos foram impactados negativamente pela entrada da
China no comércio mundial. De uma forma geral, as firmas desses três países perderam 5,7% de suas
exportações para os EUA e 7,2% para a União Europeia por conta da expansão da China. Em termos de
volume, esses três países deixaram de exportar US$ 9 bilhões somente para o mercado americano.
Comparando os resultados entre os países, o Brasil apresenta ser o mais afetado comparado a México e
Perú em termos relativos. Olhando as margens e os tipos de produtos, os produtos finais sofreram mais
com a competição chinesa em comparação aos produtos intermediários, porém não é factível distinguir
qual margem, intensiva ou extensiva, foi a mais afetada.

Introduction
Trade policies (such as trade liberalization, trade agreements and so forth) have dominated to
international trade literature as the main economic shock to affect trade. However, this emphasis began
to be questioned by some scholars. For instance, Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016) argues that other
economic shocks, such as Chinese productivity growth and its entrance to the WTO in 2001, became
more relevant to affect international trade than trade policies per se. Different scholars have already
started to investigate the impacts of China in developed and developing countries [see Acemoglu et al
(2016), Autor et al (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016) for the USA, Mion and Zhu (2013) for Belgium,
Utar and Ruiz (2013) and Blyde et al (2017) for Mexico, Costa et al (2016), Moreira and Lage de Sousa
(2017) and Paz (2017) for Brazil]. Majority of these papers focuses on labor market adjustments and
some on firm’s efficiency.1 Although Chinese import penetration has displaced some domestic
producers, it has also substitute imports from other countries in a diverse range of markets. While the
effects on the former are widely explored, the impacts on the latter are still scant. Closer to the spirit of
this paper is Bas and Bombarda (2012), since it investigates the liberalization occurred in Asian countries
on the French exports. This paper tries to fill out the gap in the literature on how exports from other
developing countries have been affected by the entrance of China in the WTO using export micro data
from three developing countries: Brazil, Mexico and Peru.
This paper contributes to that literature on the effects of trade on the extensive margin. A part of the
literature investigates the impact of trade in general on the extensive margin, such as Feenstra (1994)
and Broda and Weinstein (2006) and their results suggest a substantial impact of trade on the extensive
margin. Another part assess the impact of trade policies on the extensive margin either new variety or
new destination [Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997), Arkolakis et al (2008) and Goldberg et al (2010)],
while another on the extensive margin of entry [see Caliendo et al (2015) as an example]. Klenow and
Rodriguez-Clare (1997) and Arkolakis et al (2008) found limited impact of trade policy on the extensive
margins in Costa Rica, yet these results are not corroborated in Goldberg et al (2010) in India since their
results suggest an impact in new products. Moreover, Caliendo et al (2015) evidences infer that trade
policy has a large impact on firm entry and the effect is more pronounced in developed than in
developing countries. Therefore, much more work in this area should be pursued in order to have a
general assessment of the effects of trade on the extensive margins, as pointed by Goldberg and Pavcnik
(2016).
Given this background, this paper adds in the literature in two fronts. First, it assesses the impact of an
economic shock, China shock, more relevant to international trade than a trade policy per se. Moreover,
it was a shock at international scale which has affected a diverse range of countries not only inward
their economies but also outward. Second, it contributes to the recent investigation on the margins of
trade, which has received increasingly attention by the literature.
In order to investigate this issue, this paper uses export firm-level data from three Latin American (LA)
countries representing three different economic trade blocks: Brazil (Mercosur); Peru (Andean
Community); Mexico (NAFTA).2 Using a detailed firm-level data, this investigation evaluates how much
firms from these countries have reduced their exports to relevant markets, such as the United States
and European Union, and to other developing countries, which is represented by the bilateral trade
between them. Additionally, differences between intensive and extensive margins are explored as well
as products classification between final and intermediate goods. Results suggest that firms in these
countries were negatively affected by the expansion of Chinese goods in any kind of markets. Moreover,

for example productivity. All other papers listed investigate only labor outcomes.

final goods suffered more from the Chinese competition compared to intermediaries, yet it is not clear
which margin, intensive or extensive, was mostly affected by the China shock. Although it is not
distinguishable between intensive and extensive margins, outcomes are robust to find an impact of a
trade shock in the margins, which is contribution to the literature which was controversial as described
in Goldberg and Pavcnik (2016).
In order to explore this issue, this paper is structure as follows apart from this introduction. Section 1
provides an economic background of these countries export performance after the emergence of China
in the international trade market. Methodology is described in Section 2 followed by data description in
the next section. Section 4 provides the results in different markets. Different angles of exports are
explored in Section 5, such as intensive versus extensive margins as well as distinct types of goods. Last
section provides the concluding remarks.
Economic Background
The three countries investigated in this paper have close ties to the United States (US) and European
Union (EU). For instance, nearly 90% of Mexican and a quarter of the Brazilian and Peruvian exports
were destined to the US market in 2000. After 13 years, their export shares to the US have reduced to
78.8% for Mexico, 10.2% for Brazil and 18.3% for Peru. One part is explained by the increase importance
of China in the export basket from these LA countries, but another is their loss of market share in the US
market. In order to have an idea on how much these countries have lost market share in the US and
European market, Graph 1 presents the share of these three countries in both markets from 90’s until
2013.3 As shown, similarities between these two destinations exist, but also there are distinct patterns.
One different fact is that China already had a larger share of the EU imports compared to these three
countries in the 90’s, but the opposite occurs in the US market. Another distinction between these the
US and EU markets is that the shares of Chinese exports and the share of these three LA countries were
stable in the EU market in the 90’s, yet an upward trend in the US market is perceived for both (China
and LA countries) during the same period. The path changes completely after 2000 for China and these
three LA countries. On one hand, China remains acquiring market share in the US, reaching 20% of total
US imports. On the other hand, these LA countries stalled completely around 12.5% in the twenty first
century. In the EU market, China shares jumped to over 10% while imports from these three LA
countries remained less than 2%.
                                         INSERT GRAPH 1 HERE
Overall, China gained substantial market share in the US and EU markets since their ascension in the
WTO (10.6 p.p. and 6.7 p.p., respectively), while these three LA countries stagnated. The increased
participation of Chinese goods in these markets enhanced the competition for exporters from those
three LA countries.
Chinese export success is not restricted to the main markets, US and EU; thus it is also interesting to
consider the impact of China in the exports from these three LA countries to other developing countries.
As Brazil, Mexico and Peru are considered similar in terms of their export performance, according to the
World Bank, considering each of them as a destination from another one seems reasonable. In other
words, how much was lost from Brazilian exporters due to the imports of Chinese products in Mexico
and Peru is considered in this investigation. This might be important for Brazil and to a less extent to
Mexico and Peru, since Brazil manufacturing exports to Latin America is a relevant share of its total
exports.
Methodology
Our empirical strategy begins by pooling all export information from three origin countries (Brazil,
Mexico and Peru) to five destinations: USA, European Union and the other two Latin American

 The share of these LA countries is the total US or EU imports from these three countries divided by the total
imports from the US and EU.

countries. For instance, Mexico and Peru are the destinations considered in the Brazilian exports, and so
forth. For econometric specification, this paper follows the commonly empirical trade literature which
works with firm-level data, sometimes named “shift-share” analysis. While the dependent variable is at
firm level, the main important independent variable is aggregated at product level, which provides an
exogenous measure for the referred investigation. In summary, basic econometric specification utilized
in this paper is described by equation 1.
Log(Yiodp,t+1)= c + γ log(ChinaSharedp,t)+ α V’iodp,t + µiodp + θt + εiodp,t                                    (1)
Yiodp,t+1 is the export value of firm i from country o to destination d of product p in time t+1,
ChinaSharedp,t is the Chinese export share in destination d of product p in time t, V’iodp,t is a vector of
controls, µiodp is the firm-origin-destination-product fixed effect, θt is the year fixed effect and εiodp,t is the
error term. In other words, the estimations consider fixed effects in terms of firm, product, origin,
destination and year. Therefore, all time-invariant characteristics which could explain any of these
dimension, such as country’s geographical location, natural comparative advantage to produce a certain
product, bilateral trade advantage, or even firm’s location close to good infrastructure, are captured by
these fixed effects.
Moreover, the specification has one-year lag between the independent and dependent variable to
provide a more exogenous independent variable, which is commonly used in the literature, see Bas and
Bombarda (2012) as an example. As the main variables are in logs, the coefficient gamma (γ) is the
elasticity between the import share of Chinese goods and firm’s export of the referred product.
For controls, aside the fixed effects, a combination of time-variant characteristics is also considered.
First, total exports of the firm to the world is utilized to capture any size variation at firm level. Since the
independent variable is lagged one-year, then the total amount exported in the previous year is utilized
as a measure of firms’ size. As there are other factors at firm level that varies over time, such as
efficiency measured by productivity, firm-year fixed effect is included to capture the entire time-varying
characteristic at firm level that affects firms’ capability to export.
Other two extra controls are considered at product level. First, goods exported from these countries
face different import tariffs in distinct destinations. Therefore, effective import tariffs faced by each
product at HS 4 level in each destination is included to absorb that, as used in Li and Moreira (2018).
Products from these countries might have a different performance over the years, for example a policy
aiming to improve the productivity of specifics products, thus share of each product for each country in
the world market is calculated to capture any kind of improve of comparative advantage obtained
during the period or even any kind of change bilateral trade agreement.
After having the full picture of the exports of all three investigated countries in four markets, being two
developed markets and other two developing countries, it is interesting to break down the sample in
order to investigate the effects in each market. First, effects in the EU and US markets should be
investigated. Therefore, all the firm-level database from Brazil, Mexico and Peru are pooled to see if the
Chinese share in the American and European market have reduced level of exports of these three Latin
American countries as a whole. In order to estimate this, one fixed effect should be discarded as only
one destination for all countries is considered, therefore fixed effect shifts from firm-product-origin-
destination to firm-product-origin only. However, firms in each country face different market access, for
instance, Mexican firms have NAFTA yet Brazilian and Peruvian not, yet when estimating by country, it is
relevant to remove another fixed effect (origin), therefore fixed effect remains solely as firm-product.
Aside time-invariant characteristics, this paper estimate the model combining some characteristics with
year to control for any characteristic-year fixed effects to capture any kind of time variant characteristics
which might interfere the export performance of a product from a firm originated from one of those
three countries to the investigated destinations, such as any change in the trade policy that might have
benefited specific firms to export a particular good originated from one LA country to one of the four
destinations considered. As described in the time-invariant fixed effects, each data used will require a


4
different characteristic-year fixed effect, ranging from firm-product-origin-destination-year fixed effect
to only firm-product-year fixed effect depending on which data is considered.
Although the main variable is lagged in time and aggregated at product level, it remains endogenous
since an exogenous demand shock might be correlated to the participation of China in the total import
from each country. Following Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) methodology, the share of China in a
similar region lagged another three years is used as instrument. For example, if when investigating the
effects of China imports in the US market on the Brazilian exports, the share of Chinese imports in the
European Union market is used as an instrument lagged in time, and vice-versa. For exports to other LA
countries, information between them is triangulated. Since these countries are similar in terms of export
performance, using the remaining country as instrument seems reasonable. For instance, the share of
Chinese imports in Peru as the instrument lagged in time is used when estimating the impact of Chinese
goods in the exports of Brazilian firms to Mexico, and so forth.
Data
To implement this investigation, export firm-level dataset from the three countries mentioned
previously is utilized: Brazil, Mexico and Peru. Peruvian and Mexican datasets are from the Export
Dynamic Database created by the World Bank, see Fernandes, Freund and Pierola (2016) for further
information. While the Brazilian export data was provided by the Brazilian Trade Secretary (Secretaria de
Comercio Exterior – SECEX). All these data are disaggregated as firm-year-product-destination.
Different HS classification occurred in the investigated period. Cebeci (2015) is used as a guide to create
a homogenous product classification over the years. The period available differs from each country,
while Peruvian data is from 1993 until 2007, the Mexican ranges from 2000 until 2007 and the Brazilian,
from 1997 until 2010. Therefore, the common period for this investigation is from 2000 until 2007,
which is the base period for this paper.4
Our independent variable is constructed by using the UNCOMTRADE product-year level dataset from the
following economic regions: European Union, United States, Brazil, Mexico and Peru. Chinese import
shares in the European Union and United States are used for the three countries investigated. The
information on the Chinese import share in each of the investigated country is used in triangular way
between them, as explained in the empirical strategy.
Controls measured at product level have two different sources. Tariffs are extracted mainly from WITS,
but some more detailed information are obtained from the Latin-American Integration Association (its
acronym ALADI in Spanish) or Central American Common Market (CACM). The value of the tariff
represents the preferential tariff which each product of these countries face in each market. For the
share of each product from each particular country, trade information from the UNCOMTRADE dataset
is utilized.
Results
First results are presented in Table 1 and they are based on estimating equation 1 using the firm-level
data from the three countries pooled together to all destinations considered in this investigation. The
first three columns present the outcomes using only fixed-effects approach, while the last three columns
show the results using IV approach, where the share of Chinese goods in the other market lagged three
years is utilized as instrument. The first columns of each method (columns 1 and 4) present results using
only the time-invariant FE at firm, product, origin and destination level as well as year FE. The second
columns (2 and 5) incorporate the firm-year FE. The last columns (3 and 6) is the most complete
specification since it considers firm-origin-destination-year FE.
Considering controls used, they all present the expected outcomes, which is larger firms and those
exporting products with higher comparative advantage (measured by the product share in total exports

averaged at firm-level) tend to export more, while those facing larger barriers by import tariffs appears
to export less. Focusing on the main investigated variable, results back up the idea that Chinese
penetration in the international trade has reduced the exports of LA firms, since it is negative despite
which approach is considered. Although negative, some results seem to be elastic while others not
much. Using the IV estimation with all the controls available, for every 1% increase of Chinese exports to
US, a firm in these countries diminishes its export of that good by 0.9%. It is important to mention that
instrument used shows reasonable first-stage evidence.
                                            INSERT TABLE 1 HERE
Estimating the effects in the US market is important because it was the market which Chinese goods had
an incredible growth reaching nearly 1 in every 5 dollars imported from Americans. Then, focus on this
market to evaluate what was the impact of Chinese imports is relevant. Table 2 shows the results in the
USA market following the same structure from Table 1.
                                            INSERT TABLE 2 HERE
Results on the US market remain similar to those presented in Table 1. For controls, the only difference
occurs in the tariffs which become non-significant in most cases, including the most complete one. The
main reason might be that existent trade agreements have removed the explanation power of tariffs in
firms’ export performance, especially considering that most of the observations are from Mexico which
signed NAFTA in the 90s. Looking at the main investigated variable, China Share, it is easy to observe
that the Chinese expansion has reduced the level of exports from each firm; however, at a lower
magnitude. In the most complete model, the elasticity is 0.75 which means that any 1% increase in
imports from China would reduce the export from Latin American firms by 0.75%.
Another important market for Latin American countries is the European Union. Table 3 presents the
results considering only this destination as a market for LA goods. Results become even more similar to
Table 1, since the parameter for tariffs shift back to negative consistently. The China Share persists
negative across specifications as in previous results. However, the magnitude is larger in all
specifications, which means that the elasticity regarding the European market is higher. Considering the
most reliable estimate, column 6, an increase of 1% of Chinese exports to the European Union reduces
the exports by 1.6% from firms of these three LA countries. In other words, the effects on the European
market is twice more intense than in the US market. This might indicate that the commercial ties
between US and these Latin American countries are stronger than those with European Union.
                                            INSERT TABLE 3 HERE
Analysis shifts to how Chinese import penetration in the US and EU markets has impacted each of these
three countries individually. Although these three countries are similar in terms of export performance,
they still have their own particularity, especially in terms of their export destination. Table 4 shows the
estimation of equation 1 for each of these three countries and the US as a destination of their exports.
The first 6 columns show the estimation without instruments and the last 6 columns, using an IV
approach. Each country has two columns. Those with odd numbers does not contemplate the firm-year
FE, but it includes size as a control. Columns with even numbers includes the firm-year FE, which drops
the size as control.
                                            INSERT TABLE 4 HERE
Results remain consistent with all the countries pooled together, which means: Chinese penetration in
the US market has reduced the exports of firms in these three LA countries. Using or not instrument,
firms in Brazil, Peru and Mexico have their exports reduced to the US due to the increase competition of
China goods. However, countries differ in term of the effects. Looking at the IV results using firm-year
FE, Brazil and Peru show elasticity equal to one, while Mexico show a lower magnitude. For every 1%
increase of Chinese imports in the US market reduced the export volume of a Brazilian or Peruvian firms
by around 1%, but only 0.65% from a Mexican firm. These results may suggest that countries with a
trade agreement tend to suffer much less than others. For instance, Mexico has a trade agreement with


6
the US since 1994 and the effect of Chinese goods on Mexican exports was inelastic and around a third
lower of what Brazilian and Peruvian firms suffered.
As described previously, it is relevant to investigate the effects in the EU market. Table 5 presents the
outcomes on how these three LA countries were affected by the import of Chinese goods from the EU
market following the structure of Table 4. Results remain similar to those from Table 4, since the main
estimated parameters, China Share, are negative in most specifications. For comparison between
countries, the most reliable result is considered, which contain the IV estimation and controls for firm-
year FE (columns 8, 10 and 12). Looking at these results, it is feasible to conclude that Brazil and Mexico
were more impacted than Peru, around 10 times. For every 1% growth of Chinese imported goods in the
EU market, exports from Brazilian and Mexican firms are dropped by 2% yet from Peruvian firms, only
0.2%. This evidence confirms that Chinese goods tend to be more substitutes of Brazilian and Mexican
goods compared to Peruvians, which seems plausible as the economies of Brazil and Mexico are more
diverse than from Peru.
                                            INSERT TABLE 5 HERE
Another interesting comparison is in which market these countries were most affected by the increase
competition of Chinese goods in the US and EU markets. Peru seems to be less impacted in its exports to
EU market than to US market, because results are more robust across specifications in the later than in
the former. Moreover, the elasticity in the US market is five times higher in magnitude than the same
for the EU market. In this regard, results suggest that Peruvian exports tend to be more similar to
Chinese goods in the US market than in the EU market.
Brazil and Mexico suffered more from the competition of Chinese goods in the EU market than in the US
market, yet these two countries differ substantially in terms of their intensity in each market. While
Mexican firms were affected nearly four times in EU (2.3/0.6) than in the US, Brazilian firms less than
double (1.9/0.9). For Mexico, one possible explanation might be the length of time of Mexican trade
agreement with these two destinations. Mexico has signed a NAFTA free trade agreement in 1994 and
with EU six years later; therefore, trade relationships between Mexico and the USA seem more resistant
that those between Mexico and EU to an exogenous shock (the emergence of China). This evidence
suggests that the length of a trade agreement might attenuate the effects of the China shock.
The impact of Chinese goods is not restricted to the main markets, such as the US and EU, but rather all
other destinations. In order to evaluate the impact of the Chinese expansion in developing world, the
impact on the export of these countries to each other is estimated, as explained in the empirical
strategy section. Table 6 shows the results using the most complete method, which is the IV approach
using firm-year FE (last columns from each case in previous tables).
                                            INSERT TABLE 6 HERE
Brazil and Mexico are the countries which have a larger export base than Peru to developing countries,
especially in terms of manufacturing goods. As a consequence, these two countries were the most
affected by the Chinese import penetration while exporting to other LA countries. The elasticity from
these two countries ranges from 1.5 to 2, which means that every 1% increase in imports from China
reduces the export of Brazilian and Mexican firms by nearly from 1.5% to 2%. Peruvian exporters were
the only ones not affected by the competition of Chinese goods in the Brazilian and Mexican markets,
since the elasticity estimated is non-significant. Overall, it is feasible to infer that Peruvian goods are not
competitors of Chinese goods in developing countries, while Brazilian and Mexican are. Moreover, these
results suggest that the loss derived by the Chinese competition for Brazilian and Mexican exports to
developing countries are similar to those observed in EU. Therefore, firms from Brazil and Mexico
compete with similar Chinese products in developing countries as in the European market. Therefore, a
policy recommendation might be the expansion of trade agreements within LA countries in order to
mitigate the impact of China expansion in these markets.

Further Results
Outcomes from this paper have shown that Brazilian, Mexican and Peruvian exporters were affected by
the Chinese penetration in a diverse range of markets, but so far, they are silent in what type of exports
has been mostly affected, such as by intensive versus extensive margins and by product type (final
versus intermediary).5 In this section, these possibilities are explored. Initially, intensive versus extensive
margins is assessed by dividing the sample into these two categories. In sequence, extensive margin is
split into entry in the investigated market and exporting a new product to this aforementioned market.
Every export belonging to the intensive margin means that a firm has exported the same good to the
same destination in a previous year. If they have started to export to the investigated destination or a
new product to the designated destination, then it is considered an extensive margin.6 Basically, data is
divided according to the diagram below:

Outcomes for intensive and extensive margins are presented in Table 6 for all three LA countries
investigated in this paper to all destinations considered: developed region (US and EU) and developing
countries (Brazil, Mexico and Peru). The table is structured as follows, the first four columns show the
results in the US market, followed by other four columns on the EU market and the last six columns to
the LA countries as destinations. The first four lines show the results on intensive margin, followed by
other four lines on the extensive margin, another four lines for extensive margin entry and the last four
lines, extensive margin product. All results are based on the most reliable result as shown in Table 6: IV
approach with firm-year FE for countries individually and firm-origin-year FE when pooling Brazil, Mexico
and Peru together (columns 1 and 5). Contrary to the existent literature on the effects of trade shocks
on the margins, our results suggest robust evidence that China shock has impacted negatively on any
kind of margin.

Overall, the Chinese invasion in the US market has impacted negatively exports of intensive margin from
these tree countries jointly, but this result is mostly driven by Brazil and Peru, since Mexican exports
were not impacted. This is evidence that the bilateral trade developed after NAFTA came into force
might have attenuated the Chinese impact. In the EU market, all countries show a negative sign in the
intensive margin, not only jointly but also isolated. Brazil was the most affected as an increase of 1%
from Chinese imports reduced the exports in the intensive margin of Brazilian goods by 2.5%, while the
Mexican by 1.8% and Peru 0.5%. Comparing these results with the US, Brazil has suffered more in the EU
market, but Peru in the US market. When estimating these elasticities in the intensive margin for the

  As it is investigating only one destination, it is assumed that a new country destination is considered a new entry.
For instance, consider a firm which was exporting to other countries but not the US, if it starts exporting to the US,
it is considered a new entry rather than a new destination. Moreover, classification of intensive and extensive
margin is made on a year by year case. For instance, it is considered the previous year to establish if it is an
intensive or extensive margin, as well as to classify them by entry or product.

exports to developing countries, Brazil and Mexico were also affected by the Chinese penetration in
these markets; Peru does not show any effect. However, the magnitude is similar to what was observed
to the European market. Comparing which markets, either from developing countries or from developed
countries, only Peruvian exports shows a distinction, since only their exports to developed countries
that were affected by the Chinese expansion in the international trade market.
The effect of China expansion in international trade seems to have distinct impacts in the extensive
margin compared to intensive margin depending on which bilateral trade is considered. Considering the
three LA countries jointly, outcomes suggest that extensive margin was more impacted in their exports
to the US compared to intensive margin, yet differences in the European market does not allow us to
say which margin suffered more. In the US market, Mexico is the only case which it is possible to infer
that the extensive margin was more affected than intensive margin. Thus, although existent
relationships between Mexico exporters and US importers appears to not be impacted by the China
Shock, the possibility to enter in the US market, either by a new firm or by exporting a new product, has
become harder for Mexican exporters due to the increase presence of China in the US market. In terms
of exports of extensive margin to developing countries, Peru remains not being affected by the Chinese
invasion in the Brazilian and Mexico markets, yet Mexico and Brazil were negatively affected in their
bilateral trade.
Looking at the impacts of the two types of extensive margin, Chinese competition was fiercer in the
extensive margin of entry compared to the extensive margin of products in the US market (1.1 versus
0.7), yet the opposite occurs in the EU market (1.6 versus 0.9). In other words, Chinese imports in the US
makes it more difficult for LA firms to enter in this market than in the EU market, but the exports of a
new product from these three LA countries to the EU become more challenging compared to the US.
This suggests that once firms from LA countries are able to establish a relationship with the US, they
suffer less from other competitors compared to the EU which entrance seems easier, yet difficult to
export a new good. Regarding the extensive margin for entry and product to developing countries, only
Brazilian exports to Mexico show robust results in the two dimensions (entry and product). Mexican
exports to either Brazil or Peru were also negatively impacted at the introduction of a new product in
these markets by the Chinese competition.
Evidence on extensive and intensive margin are linked with the idea that Mexican and Brazilian
economies tend to export products similar to Chinese goods compared to Peru. Therefore, larger and
more diversified economies in developing world tend to suffer more from the competition from Chinese
goods. Moreover, the elasticities obtained in this paper are generally above one, which means that for
any increase of Chinese exports, firms from those countries tend to lose much more.
Another venue which could be explored is evaluating the impact on distinct types of goods, as done in
Bas and Bombarda (2012). Following this aforementioned paper methodology, products are reclassified
into two categories from the BEC: final and intermediary. Following the format of Table 7, results
splitting the sample into these three products categories are presented in Table 8. The only difference
from Table 7 is how lines are distributed. The first lines are now for final goods, followed by lines for
intermediary goods and lastly by lines for capital goods.
                                            INSERT TABLE 8 HERE
In terms of final goods, Brazil and Mexico seem to be the most affected, since all the elasticities
estimated are superior to what is encountered in Peru regardless which destination, either developed
countries (EU and US) or developing countries (Mexico or Peru). According to the outcomes, Brazil
appears to be mostly affected than Mexico, especially in the US and in developing countries. Moreover,
most of all the significant elasticities are above one, which means that any increase of imports of
Chinese final goods will reduce the export of those countries more than proportionally.
As for intermediaries, the elasticity is lower in the US market compared to EU, which is the opposite of
what was found for final goods. In the US market, only Mexico seems to be affected by Chinese

imported goods and with an elasticity below one, which means that the effect in the US market was very
limited. In the EU market, estimated elasticities for Brazil and Mexico are above two, and then exports
of these two countries suffered more than proportionately by the import of Chinese goods. In
developing market, the effect is very similar to the EU market, as the estimated elasticity was around 2
for Brazil and Mexico. Peruvian intermediary goods exported were not affected by the Chinese
competition in neither market: developed and developing regions.
Conclusion
In this paper, the impact of Chinese goods in the exports of three LA countries (Brazil, Mexico and Peru)
to developed and developing regions is estimated. These three countries represent different trade
economic zones in LA: MERCOSUR, NAFTA and Andean Community. Results suggest that these countries
were highly affected by the Chinese competition in both regions. Overall, elasticities estimated show
that an increase of Chinese penetration in any market generally imposes a larger loss in these countries
export, since the elasticities magnitude is over 1 in most cases. Considering the expansion of China was
7.7% in the US and 4.5% in the EU from 2000 until 2007, the loss of the exports due to the Chinese
expansion in these markets was 5.7% and 7.2%, respectively.7 This evidence contrasts with those using
aggregate data, which showed a higher impact in the US rather than in the European Union, see Pereira
(2014). However, results using aggregate data are based on the comparison of absolute value of the loss
in USD. In this paper, just considering the US as a destination, these three countries lost USD 9 billion
dollars in exports because of Chinese goods.
Comparing results of which country was mostly affected, outcomes suggest that countries with a trade
agreement, such as NAFTA from Mexico and the US, tend to be less impacted by the inclusion of a new
competitor in relative terms, but these results need to be corroborated with other investigations since
most of the effect might have taken place before signing the trade agreement.8 Despite this discussion
on trade agreements, it is evident that Brazil was the most affected by the China shock, since elasticities
estimated are predominantly higher in the Brazilian case.
Impact of trade shocks on the margins is still debatable in the current trade literature [Goldberg and
Pavcnik (2016)], but outcomes of this paper provide robust evidence on the effect of the China shock on
the margins of trade. However, it is not clear which margin, intensive or extensive, was mostly affected
by the Chinese shock, because results differ substantially across countries. However, evidence on
different types of goods seems more robust as they show a higher impact on final goods compared to
intermediary goods. These results on types of goods are complementary to what Bas and Bombarda
(2012) found for French exporters. According to their findings, intermediary goods were more imported
after the liberalization process occurred in Asian countries, especially China, which means that these
countries are assembling goods in their territory to export to other countries. This is not surprising as
China has become the main manufacturing country in the world.
Although this paper has shed some lights on the impacts of China in exporting firms from other
developing countries, other venues should be explored. For instance, outcomes suggest that trade
agreements might be an important tool to mitigate the impact in trade relations originated by an
exogenous shock, especially by the increase competition from other countries. However, further
research should be pursued in order to confirm this hypothesis, which may provide an additional
argument to foster trade agreements between countries.
