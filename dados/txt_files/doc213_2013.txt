Analisar os diferenciais de rendimentos nas ocupações dos trabalhadores brasileiros é o foco central deste
trabalho. Em virtude da vasta diversidade de ocupações catalogadas pelo IBGE (cerca de 800), aplica-se
um procedimento teórico para reduzi-las em apenas sete a fim de permitir tratamento estatístico dos
dados. São estimadas equações mincerianas quantílicas, sobre as quais são feitas decomposições para
verificar o hiato entre os rendimentos dos indivíduos com atributos inerentes distintos, bem como entre
aqueles residentes em regiões mais e menos desenvolvidas do país. Os resultados das estimações
ratificam a importância da análise desagregada em estratos ocupacionais e por quantis, uma vez que os
efeitos das variáveis explicativas são distintos ao longo das distribuições de rendimentos e entre as
ocupações. Em relação às lacunas existentes entre as distribuições de rendimentos, verifica-se um glass
ceiling effect em algumas ocupações, ou seja, a defasagem é maior no topo da distribuição. Entretanto, na
maioria dos casos, a ocorrência do hiato é maior na base da distribuição – sticky floor effect. Além disso,
diferente das lacunas entre gêneros, que são decorrentes apenas da remuneração às características dos
indivíduos (discriminação), os diferenciais de rendimentos entre raças e regiões também decorrem das
diferentes características dos trabalhadores.

Analyzing the income differentials amongst the Brazilian workers’ occupations is the focus of this paper.
Due to the wide diversity of occupations cataloged by the IBGE (around 800), a theoretical procedure is
applied to reduce them to only seven in order to allow statistical treatment of the data. The
methodological approach is based on Mincer quantile equations to be estimated in various strata of the
workers’ income distribution, on which a breakdown is made to check the gap among the individuals’
income with distinct inherent attributes and between those living in both more and less developed
regions. The estimation results ensure the importance of breakdown analysis for occupational strata as
well as for quantiles, since the effects of explanatory variables are distinct along the income distribution
and vary among occupations. Regarding the gaps in this distribution, there is a glass ceiling effect in
some occupations, that is, the gap is greater at the top of distribution. However, in most cases the gap is
greater at the bottom of the distribution – sticky floor effect. Moreover, contrary to the gap in gender,
which is due to the compensation characteristics of individuals only (discrimination), income
differentials between regions and races also occur from the heterogeneous characteristics of workers.

1. INTRODUCTION
         Economic growth and the increase in demand for jobs has generated significant changes in the
Brazilian job market dynamics. Besides that, the recent phenomenon of income inequality reduction has
a direct implication for the transformations that have occurred in the market occupational distribution, be
it transformations in demand, be it supply ones. (BARROS, 2007).
         However, centuries old problems such salary inequalities between individuals who work at
similar activities and also have the same qualifications, are still observable. For instance, the salary gap
                                                                                                               2

between men and women, between whites and non-whites and between residents of more and less
developed regions. In some cases, acquired attributes such as education level and work experience seem
to have less relevance than a worker’s gender or race. As an illustration to grasp this idea, data from the
Brazil’s National Household Sampling Survey (PNAD) of 2011 reveals that for individuals 10 years and
older, the averages of education years of women and men are respectively 7,5 and 7,1, which means a
5,6% superiority in favor of women. On the other hand, the men’s average monthly earning are 73,7%
higher than that for women, that is, R$1.129 and R$650, respectively.
         So, it becomes relevant to investigate how education and other personal attributes have affected
the Brazilian worker. It is also believed to be indispensable such analysis to take into account not only
distinctions between inherent attributes and regionalization, but also differences among the diverse
occupational categories due to requirements on each of them regarding human capital level.
         On an empirical application of such nature, it is usual to get theoretical support based on Mincer
equations that spot the effects of explanatory factors on the average variation of the individual worker’s
income. Worth reminding is that the impact of every factor can significantly vary among the income
distribution strata. It is expected, for instance, that effects of inherent characteristics such as ethnicity and
gender, or acquired characteristics such as human capital to differentiate according to occupation and
income stratification. Therefore, the results obtained by applying this methodological technique on non-
stratified samples, which is often applied in literature, produce inconsistent and distorted effects.
         This paper relies on quantile Mincer equations to verify the impact of explanatory variables on
every earning distribution quantile, allowing for the occurrence of differentiated effects when stratifying
workers’ income distribution by occupation. Starting from strata, an investigation about the lagging
between workers’earning caused by gender, ethnicity and region differences, according to the
methodology by Machado and Mata (2005), which expands the formulation of the Blinder-Oaxaca
Decomposition (BLINDER, 1973; OAXACA, 1973). For this purpose, the conditional wage distributions
of these categories are estimated via quantile equations, marginal distributions are obtained, when
comparisons are made between the abovementioned categories, they turn possible the decomposition of
differences in income distributions into two components: one that comes from observable characteristics
of workers and another from the returns to these characteristics, which may be interpreted as
discrimination.
         The main methodological hurdle for the actualization of the estimations is the considerable
number of more than eight hundred occupational categories designated by The Brazilian Institute Of
Geography and Statistics Foundation (FIBGE) . To overcome such hurdle and make estimations possible,
it is vital to implement a special handling on the data so as to create occupation groups and then have a
statistically-practicable numbers that lead to inferences of greater degree of freedom and accuracy,
despite the possibility of information loss.
         The seminal contribution to the investigation of occupational choices is believed to have been
made by Roy (1951), who identified in such choices, the skills and these skills’ return distribution for
every occupation. In order for a proper continuity of this analysis through the application of adequate
inference methods with discrete choices, some researchers suggested the grouping of those numerous
occupational categories in smaller strata.
         One of the earliest proposals was made by Erickson, Goldthorpe and Portocarrero (1979) which
was later honed by Goldthorpe, Llewellyn and Payne (1987), who designed a scheme known as EGP
(named after the initials of the first authors). It is comprised of seven occupational classes and it is
internationally used, including by the CASMIN Project (an acronym for Comparative Analysis of Social
Mobility in Industrial Nations), whose purpose is centered on the analysis of labor mobility in the
industrial realities of various European Union countries. Later on, many other grouping formulations
came up, and all of show similarity to the EGP proposal. Among them, the Vale Silva (1988) formulation
stands out, for it incorporates significant axes for the identification of similarities and differences
between categories, such as the dichotomy between rural and urban sectors as well as the dichotomy
between manual and non-manual labor, so it grouped the numerous categories into eighteen sets.
Nevertheless, such scheme has not been widely used due to its analysis difficulty, so researchers have
been opting for the implementation of a grouping proposal which contains a lower number of categories.

        It is expected that this study will contribute to the debate about this subject when it conducts an
analysis of the earning distribution quantiles of every occupation, and by individual characteristics, it
identifies the factors that affect them. When using the EGP scheme, firstly a recoding of the
PNAD(Brazil’s National Household Sampling Survey) data is required to effectively group those various
occupational categories into just seven sets, and then an analysis of the Brazilian job market by
occupational categories is conducted. Such analysis is approached by the estimation of Mincer quantile
equations and by identifying and decomposing the existing hiatus between men’s income and women’s
incomes, whites and non-whites, individuals who reside in the Northeast region or in another more-
developed region (namely the South, the Southeast or the Midwest). Besides verifying the strata in which
the applied explanatory variables affect the income distribution, this procedure makes possible the
detection of distortions that may occur between personal attribute effects and in addition it also detects
the existence of likely effects such as glass ceiling or sticky floor, as previously seen in economic
literature. Once the distribution strata that are affected by each factor are identified, it becomes less
difficult to implement policies that aim to reduce income inequalities, which leads to the improvement of
workers’ well-being.
        This article comprises four additional sections. A selective review of the literature is highlighted
in the next section, followed by a discussion of both the methodology and the results. The last section is
reserved to the final remarks.
2. A SELECTIVE REVIEW OF LITERATURE: MINCER EQUATIONS, DECOMPOSITION
    OF INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND OCCUPATIONS
        In the 20th century, Schultz (1961) and Ben-Porath (1967) formulated, despite the absence of
theoretical strictness, the relation between education and income. However, the debates and the empirical
applications were intensified after the publishing of the seminal article by Mincer (1974), which
formalized the theory of the derivation of such relation whose equation specifies the worker’s income as
a function of his or her formal education and experience acquired on the job. It is worth mentioning, that
most applications use a simplified version of the Mincer model in which the rigidity hypothesis is
assumed, that is, returns from education and experience are invariable among individuals. However, the
most general of his model, and the most realistic one, acknowledges the possibility of such returns to
vary among individuals. And that leads to a random-coefficient model (HARMON et al, 2003). So, when
one stratifies earning distribution as it is done herein, this is the model to be applied.
        In this sense, this paper uses equations which have that methodological structure, despite having a
focus that differs from the focus usually seen in literature. For each occupational stratus, analyses of the
Brazilian workers’ income distribution and of the factors that cause changes in such distribution are
conducted. Initially, quantile mincerian equations are estimated to investigate the effects of variables like
education and experience on the workers’ income distribution. From these results, conditional
distributions are obtained from which in turn, the marginal ones will be extracted. Thus, it becomes
possible to decompose the workers’ income distributions into various components.
        The first works that contained this kind of analysis were done by Oaxaca (1973) and by Blinder
(1973), which decomposed the income distributions of males and females into a component that is
attributed to distinct individual characteristics, and into another component derived from the differences
between the returns to these characteristics. Such decomposition, however, was conducted via the Least
Squares method (LS), only for the average of the distribution. Later studies applied quantile regressions
in order to perform such analysis, thus giving information pertaining not only to the income distribution
center, but also pertaining to the substrata.
        A similar procedure was applied by Blau and Kahn (1996) to analyze the income inequalities in
the United States in comparison to nine OECD countries, with data from the 1980’s. Through the
estimation of the income densities of male workers, the authors concluded that salary inequality in the
U.S. is greater than in all other OECD countries. However, after disaggregating the income distributions
into several parts, Blau and Kahn verified that inequality in the United States is considerably
larger/smaller than in other countries in the lower/higher quantiles, respectively.
                                                                                                            4

        DiNardo et al. (1996) applied nonparametric methods to measure the effects of institutions and
the effects of job market factors on the changes of income distribution in the United States from 1979 to
1988. They concluded that labor unions and supply and demand shocks are vital to the understanding of
the income inequality rising in that period. Besides, they also found evidence that the decline of the
actual minimum salary value explains most of such inequality increase, especially due to the gender
factor.
        Based on the Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition by applying quantile regressions, Albrecht et al.
(2003) found in the Swedish workers’ income distribution what is conventionally named in literature as
the glass ceiling effect, that is, the difference in income between men and women is positive, it grows
along the distribution and intensifies at the top.
        The technique proposed by Machado and Mata (2005) has been applied in many recent articles. It
utilizes quantile regressions to identify and decompose gaps between the incomes of different categories
at different points in time. They applied the method with the purpose of verifying the changes in income
distribution in Portugal regarding the period from 1986 to1995, and concluded that the changes of the
individuals’ attributes as well as the returns of such attributes do contribute to the increase of income
inequality. They also concluded that education contributed in a decisive way to this increase.
        Albrecht et al. (2009) provided with greater theoretical support to the methodology of Machado
and Mata (2005) by evidencing the asymptoptic consistency and normality regarding such technique,
besides taking into consideration sample selection adjustments. The empirical application of such
technique aimed to test the hiatus between genders among Dutch workers’ income, and it was then that
these researchers noticed the presence of a glass ceiling effect on that distribution. Using these authors’
methodology, Paredes (2012) also analyzes the gender discrimination in the Chilean economy by
grouping up occupations in sets of nine 1, and identifies that the income hiatus between men and women
has been narrowed in categories such as managers, upscale self-employed professionals, and especially
in occupations dealing with finances and insurance. Similarly for Brazil and using data from
PNAD/2007, Coelho et al (2010) have also identified such an effect through the earning distribution gap
of black and white brazilian women by performing quantile regression with semiparametric correction
for sample selection bias. Their main finding is that the returns to education are higher at the top of the
distribution.
         This work also follows the Methodology of Machado and Mata (2005), but it also verifies the
changes in the Brazilian workers’ income distributions by occupational groups which has more accurate
results. So it will benefit policies that aim to reduce salary inequalities as those policies will be designed
in a more efficient way.
        The studies abovementioned analyze the variations of salary distributions either in a n aggregate
way or considering gender differences. This research proposes an analysis that takes into account
individuals’ different occupations. The most difficult task in researches that focus on this approach is to
narrow down occupational cathegories due to the high number of disaggregated job specifications. So it
becomes vital to aggregate them in order to accomplish a practicable analysis, even if that may lead to
some information loss. Thus, various researchers have proposed different ways to aggregate such
categories into smaller groups while simultaneously trying to avoid information loss.
        The first versions of occupational distribution were proposed by Erickson, Goldthorpe and
Portocarrero (1979) and improved by Goldthorpe, Llewellyn and Payne (1987), scheme internationally
known as EGP (first authors’ initials), which is comprised of seven classes. Based on this aggregation,
occupations were then grouped in several countries studied by the CASMIN Project (Comparative
Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations), which was coordinated by Goldthorpe in the early
1980’s.
        This methodological scheme takes into account the work relations between employers and
employees in both rural and urban activity sectors. According Ribeiro and Scalon (2001) the resulting
classes at the end of the aggregation are classes of comparable individuals in terms of their income level,

financial safety degrees, career-advancement probabilities and these individuals’ autonomy to perform
work.
        There are other class-aggregation proposals, but all of them share some degree of similarity with
the proposal by Goldthorpe. Pastore (1979), by proposing that the aggregation of numerous categories to
be done by forming six groups and that accentuates the heterogeneity of each of them due to the reduced
number of strata. Aiming to reduce such in-between groups difference, Silva (1988) proposed the use of
eighteen categories. Silva’s proposal was not used by other researchers as they considered this too high a
number of categories. The opposite happened to Scalon (1999) who rearranged Silva’s (1988) eighteen
categories into nine but managed to minimize the loss of information. To achieve this, Scalon applied
cluster analysis techniques and also a criterion for combining categories based on log-linear models.
        With the goal of verifying which are the determinants of the distinctions in Brazilian workers’
earning distributions, this research uses the EGP scheme’s theoretical principle and comes with a
recoding of the PNAD data about occupations, for it grouped more than eight hundred occupational
category classifications into just seven as follows: professional managers, routine non-manual laborers,
small business owners, rural owners/employers, skilled manual laborers such as technicians and
supervisors, unskilled manual laborers, and rural-sector unskilled manual laborers. Opposite to the
analyses usually found in literature, where job market approaches are done in an aggregate fashion, this
research stands out for its partitioning of the market by occupational category strata, and that leads to
inferences that produce more realistic results for more efficient policies.
3. METHODOLOGY
        The applied methodology comprises two procedures. In the first procedure it is measured the
returns to workers’ education through quantile Mincer equations which were estimated for each
occupational stratum. The second procedure is a counterfactual decomposition of workers’ earning,
taking into account differences of gender, ethnicity and region. The data used and the variables that make
up the models are to be described in the next sections.
3.1 Earning Equations
         The first empirical exercise is the estimation of earning equations in the traditional way, however
a little differently as this estimation applies a quantile regression model created by Koenker and Basset
(1978). This way, a detailed analysis of workers’ income distribution can be conducted and it differs
from the usual application of the LS method in this kind of investigation which provides only with the
characteristics of a part of the distribution of the response variable. However, for developing countries
such as Brazil, where there is a marked heterogeneity among workers in terms of income and also in
terms of inherent and acquired attributes, where the impact of individual characteristics on earnigs is
utterly significant, the analysis by quantile regressions is the most suitable one. Equations like these are
also used in order to obtain the conditioned income distributions that are so necessary for the
decomposition proposed by Machado and Mata (2005), which is described as follows.
3.2 Decomposition of Earning Distribution
       Counterfactual decomposition can be understood as a generalization of the Blinder–Oaxaca
(1973) procedure, that applies the LS method to obtain the estimations of the median of the distribution,
but with the advantage of using quantile regressions that are modeled on each distribution quantile. This
technique allows for the decomposition of the differences of income distributions of various categories.
For instance, men and women become two components which derived from differences between
observable characteristic distributions ( education, experience,etc ) for genders, and also derived from the
returns of these characteristics. Therefore, decomposition makes possible to identify the existing gap
between the incomes of distinct classes and also to measure how much of this gap is distributed as a
consequence of characteristics and coefficients. The effect of this may be considered as discrimination
between categories. This decomposition has some stages to be described as follows.
                                                                                                                                       6

3.2.1 Conditioned Income Distributions
        The first phase of decomposition is to derive the conditioned income distributions which are
estimated through the quantile Mincer equations. This kind of equation models the relation between
regressors type (𝑧𝑧) – education level, experience, square experience, gender, ethicity, regionalization – in
the corresponding quantiles of the dependent variable [w = 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(earning)]:

                                                                 𝑄𝑄𝑞𝑞 (𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧) = 𝑧𝑧 ′ 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞                                            (1)

Where 𝑄𝑄𝑞𝑞 (𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧), for 𝑞𝑞 ∈ [0,1], is the conditional 𝑞𝑞 𝑡𝑡ℎ quantile of the distribution of the dependent
variable and 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 is the 𝑞𝑞 𝑡𝑡ℎ coefficient vector of the mincerian equation.
          As the sample average is the solution to minimizing a residual sum of squares and the median is
the solution to a sum of absolute values of the residuals , the quantile regression can be defined as a
solution to an asymmetric minimization of a weighted sum of the absolute values of the residuals. This
way, 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 can be estimated by solving this following problem (KOENKER AND BASSET, 1978):
                                  𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝛽𝛽 ∈𝑅𝑅 𝑘𝑘 ∑𝑁𝑁                          ′
                                                   𝑖𝑖:𝑤𝑤 ≥𝑧𝑧 ′ 𝛽𝛽 𝑞𝑞�𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 − 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 � +
                                                                                          ∑𝑁𝑁                                ′
                                                                                           𝑖𝑖:𝑤𝑤 <𝑧𝑧 ′ 𝛽𝛽 (1 − 𝑞𝑞)�𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 − 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 � (2)
                                                       𝑖𝑖   𝑖𝑖                              𝑖𝑖   𝑖𝑖

        Despite not having an explicit form, this problem can be efficiently solved by the application of
linear programming methods and the standard errors can be known by bootstrapping (MARTINS and
PEREIRA, 2004). Besides, Cameron and Trivedi (2009) emphasize that quantile regressions become
robust in the presence of outliers and the absence of normality of the dependent variable, and they do not
need the existence of the conditional mean to be consistent. These characteristics favor and justify its
application in numerous economic investigations just like this one.
3.2.2 Marginal Density of Wages and Decomposition of Changes In Wage Densities.
        After specifying the conditional quantile function, the estimated parameters are used to simulate
the conditional distribution of w given z, by applying the Probability Integral Transform Theorem : If 𝑌𝑌
is a continuous random variable with 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝐹𝐹𝑌𝑌 (𝑦𝑦), then, the random variable 𝐹𝐹𝑌𝑌−1 (𝑋𝑋), where 𝑋𝑋 is 𝑈𝑈(0, 1),
has a distribution 𝐹𝐹𝑌𝑌 (𝑥𝑥), if U is a uniformly-distribruted variable in [0,1], then 𝐹𝐹 −1 (𝑈𝑈) has density
function 𝐹𝐹F. If 𝑞𝑞1 , 𝑞𝑞1 , … , 𝑞𝑞𝑀𝑀 derives from a uniform distributio (0,1), the corresponding M estimations
of the quantiles of the w condicionals to 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 , 𝑤𝑤                  � 𝑖𝑖 ≡ {𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝛽𝛽̂𝑞𝑞 }𝑀𝑀
                                                                                           𝑖𝑖=1 , constitute a random sample of the
(estimated) conditional distribution of the income given 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 .
        This simulation procedure characterizes the conditional quantiles for all z, but it does not gives
the w marginal density, once this marginal density depends not only on the conditional function 𝛽𝛽̂𝑞𝑞 , but
also on the distribution of covariates g(z). Aiming to generate a random sample of the marginal density
w, one can simulate g(z) data lines and, for every 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 line, starting from a distribution 𝑈𝑈(1), simulate a
random 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 and then form 𝑤𝑤       � 𝑖𝑖 ≡ 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽̂𝑞𝑞′ 𝑖𝑖 , which is a simulation of the w density implied by the model. By
replicating this technique several times, it is possible to simulate a random sample of the desired
distribution. This procedure is equivalent to numerically integrating the estimated quantile conditional
function 𝑄𝑄�𝑞𝑞 (𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧) with the distribution of s z and q to obtain 𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤                   �) = ∬ 𝑄𝑄�𝑞𝑞 (𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧)𝑔𝑔(𝑧𝑧)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
        Inferring about the gap between the incomes of two categories (e.g. between men and women)
requires to estimate two marginal densities of earnings: the density function estimated according to the
women’s earning distribution – based on a sub-sample – can be defined as the marginal distribution
derived from the model; and the counterfactual density function, which in this case corresponds to the
men’s density function related to the women’s characteristic distribution (MACHADO and MATA,
2005).
        The procedure to calculate the marginal distribution derived from the model is summarized by
these steps:

              1. A size-M random sample is generated corresponding to the M estimates of the conditional
                 quantiles, from a distribution 𝑈𝑈(1): 𝑞𝑞1 , 𝑞𝑞1 , … , 𝑞𝑞𝑀𝑀 .
                                                                                                                          7

           2. Using data about female individuals, it is then estimated that: 𝑄𝑄𝑞𝑞 𝑖𝑖 (𝑤𝑤|𝑧𝑧)= 𝑧𝑧′𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞 . As a result,
                M estimates for the quantile regression coefficients , 𝛽𝛽̂𝑓𝑓𝑞𝑞 𝑖𝑖 ; where the f symbol refers to
                females.
           3. A size-M random sample is generated, with replacement of the vector of covariates, 𝑧𝑧𝑓𝑓 ;
           4. Using this sample, an estimate is done of the density function through the multiplication
                of the estimated vector of coefficients times the generated size-M vector of covariates:
                  � 𝑖𝑖 ≡ 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽̂𝑓𝑓𝑞𝑞
                {𝑤𝑤                 ′
                                          }𝑀𝑀 .
                                        𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖=1
        The counterfactual distribution is calculated according to the procedure above, but, on step 2 , it is
  applied data of male workers to estimate the vector of coefficients and then obtain : {𝑤𝑤    � 𝑖𝑖 ≡ 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽̂𝑚𝑚𝑞𝑞
                                                                                                                ′
                                                                                                                       }𝑀𝑀 ,
                                                                                                                     𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖=1
  where the m symbol represents males. The difference of these two density functions defines gender
  discrimination in a given period.
        The described procedure conducts the investigation on the gaps between earning distributions
caused by differences of gender, ethnicity and region. Then, for every occupational stratum, threefold
replications of the procedure are required, for every set of the binary characteristics, namely: gender, race
and region.
3.3 Database
         The database for the estimation of the proposed models was obtained from Brazil´s National
 Household Sampling Research (PNAD), which is conducted yearly by The Brazilian Institute Of
 Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Information regarding the year 2011 was gathered (the most recent
 period of available data).
 3.3.1 Occupation Definitions
         Starting from the theoretical principle of the EGP scheme, a recoding of the PNAD data was done
 so as to aggregate more than 800 occupational categories into just seven which are described as follows:
1. Profissional general directors and managers (P.G.D.M.)
     Legislators, general managers of government departments, operation and production managers,
    bioengineering professionals, biotechnology and genetic engineering professionals, mechatronics
    engineers, mathematicians, physicists, chemists, architects, doctors, surgeon dentists, veterinarians ,
    pharmacists, teachers, lawyers, judges, managers and accountants.
2. Routine non-manual laborers (R.N.M.L.)
    Registrars in general, agents, assistants and managerial assistants, secretaries, office machinery
    operators, office juniors, storekeepers and warehouse keepers, postmen, checkout operators and box
    office staff, receptionists, telephone operators, telemarketers, clerks, pollsters/interviewers.
3. Small business owners (S.B.O.)
    Employers of more than five employees, providing they have declared themselves as employers or
    self-employed individuals: wholesale agents and sales technicians, dry-cleaners, laundry workers and
    similar kinds of professionals, replenishers and retail associates responsible for markups and
    markdowns, sales supervisors.
4. Skilled manual laborers such as technicians and supervisors (S.M.L.T.S.)
    Technical designers and fashion designers, civil engineering/construction technicians, petrochemical
    technicians, topographic/land survey/hydrographic technicians, production technicians and food
    technologists, industrial lab staff, medical and dental instrument technicians.
5. Unskilled Manual Laborers (U.M.L.)
    Workers in extraction of solid minerals, earthworks and foundations, masonry structures, weaving
    preparation, textile craft, feeders in production lines.
6. Rural owners/employers (R.O.E.)
7. Rural-sector unskilled manual laborers (R.S.U.M.L.)
         Due to the heterogeneity among rural and urban workers, as well as the different work
 environments in which these two groups operate, the categories (6) and (7) were excluded from
 sampling. These categories are the ones including rural workers. The purpose of such exclusion was to
 give the analysis the necessary robustness. With the purpose of homogenizing the sample, the northern
                                                                                                                                               8

workers were left aside, due to certain socio-geographic peculiarities of the north region that may
disguise the urban characteristics of native workers as compared to the other regions of the country.
3.3.2 Variable Definition
        For each occupational group mentioned in the previous subsection, quantile Mincer equations
were estimated, and then from these equations, a counterfactual decomposition of wage distribution was
conceived. The equations were estimated according to the following specification:
 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 (𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 )2 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟ç𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽5 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽6 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽7 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 +𝛽𝛽8 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 (2)
      • (w) is the main work’s wage logarithm
     • (ed) are the education years – corresponds to a grade or a level. For the purpose of equivalence,
        each accomplished passed grade is considered as one education year.
     • (xp) is the calculated experience, it conceived as age minus six, minus the education years 2.
        When adopting this procedure, it is assumed that all individuals started out their school years at
        the age of six and they do not spend any time outside school in the market (BERNDT, 1991 apud
        KASSOUF, 1998), that is, school-attending individuals do not work. Besides, it is hypothesized
        that the sample accounts for only individuals in the range of 15 – 55 years of age.
     • (ETH) is for ethnicity - 1 for whites and 0 for non-whites;
     • (GEN) is for gender - 1 for female and 0 for male;
     • (MW) represents Midwest– 1 for the midwest region residents and 0, otherwise;
     • (NE) Northeast- 1 for the northeast region residents and 0, otherwise;
     • (SE) Southeast- 1 for the southeast region residents and 0, otherwise;
     • (S) South- 1 for the south region residents and 0, otherwise;
        The descriptive statistics of the variables applied in the model of each occupational category is
shown in Table 1. The wide amplitude in the variations of the continuous variables points for
heterogeneity among the occupational categories, which in turn justifies the suitability of the
disaggregation performed. It is worth noting that the low relative representativeness of the small business
owners category may lead to results that diverge from those of other categories.

4 RESULTS
       In this section, the results of both proposed empirical enterprises are presented. In the first
subsection brings the quantile mincerian equations, followed by the earning decomposition.
4.1 Quantile Mincerian Equations
       The quantile mincerian equations estimates by occupational stratum, as well as by LS are shown
in Table 2. They reveal that all the coefficients are significant up to a maximum of 5%. In the majority of

    This procedure was adopted because the PNAD did not have information about individuals’ experience.
                                                                                                               9

the cases, besides differing from the estimation by LS, the effect of the explanatory variables is distinct
along the distribution of the dependent variable distribution. Such characteristic is statistically proved by
the Wald Test, whose results are shown in Table 4 of Appendix A. This effect also varies between the
occupational strata and can be easily seen on the graphs 1–5 of Appendix B. These graphs, besides
showing the results by LS estimation, also evidence the influence of each explanatory variable on the
dependent quantiles by occupational category.
        The coefficients of education (ed) and experience (xp) variables are positive in all cases, with
stronger effect on the general directors’ and managers’ category (P.G.D.M.) This implies, following the
literature, that human capital contributes significantly to the increase of workers’ earnings. It is worth
emphasizing that, except for the unskilled manual laborers’ category (U.M.L.), the effect of these
variables is greater at the top of the earnings distribution. For the total number of workers, a similar
effect was noticed in the U.S.A. (Chamberlain, 1994; Buchinsky, 1994), Germany (Fitzenberger and
Kurz, 1997), Uruguay (González and Miles, 2001), Zambia (Nielsen and Rosholm, 2001), Portugal
(Machado and Mata, 2005) and Brazil (Coelho et al, 2010) for a sample of women in the range of 20–60
years of age. The xp2 variable coefficients measure to what extent additional experience years translate
into salary increases. This, in most cases, shows the expected negative sign, evidencing that at some
point the effect of experience on salaries goes null or even negative. In certain points of the distribution
of some occupational strata, these coefficients differ from what was expected. Although positive, they
are in fact practically null.
        Gender and ethnicity show a negative-and positive sign coefficients, respectively, in all quantiles
and occupations, evidencing that if a worker is a female or a non-white person, she or he will get smaller
earnings. Regarding gender, this result is similar to the result found by Machado and Mata (2005) in their
study about Portuguese workers.The effects of these variables between the quantiles are distinct in the
magnitudes of the coefficients between occupations.For the effect is stronger on some of higher quantiles
while in some others, the opposite is true.
       Inserted in the model to detect differences in earnings variation between residents of
more-and less-developed regions, the dummy variables proved to be relevant in most of the
studied cases. As expected, the negative effects are predominant on the earnings of individuals
who reside in the least-developed region (the northeast) in almost all quantiles and occupations.
Except for Small Business Owners, on which the null effect prevails in all regions, but
principally in the southeast, and also income strata whose results might have been derived from
the homogeneity degree and low sampling representativeness relative to the other occupations.
4.2 Decomposition of Earning Distribution
        In order to decompose the workers’ earning distribution into two components – a component due
to individual distinct characteristics and another one that comes from the coefficients (that is,
remuneration to these characteristics) – the procedure described in section 3 was conducted with a
replication number M equals to 1000. The characteristics included were: years of education, experience,
ethnicity (when conducting decomposition by gender) and gender (when conducting decomposition by
ethnicity and by region).
        The results of the decomposition of the gap that exists in-between men’s and women’s income,
as well as results of the whites and non-whites and workers residing in the northeast region residents in
comparison to other regions, by occupational stratum, are shown in table 3.
        Regarding the gap between the men’s income and women’s income, it is clear that in all
occupational strata, the gap is negative while it is significantly wider in the unskilled manual laborer
category, where in smaller quantiles, it surpasses 100% mark, and that the proportion originated by the
characteristics is positive. Therefore, the wage differential has to do with the coefficients, that is, it has to
do with the remuneration given to the individual due to his or her characteristics, and this means the
presence of discrimination by gender in the job market. A similar result was verified by Albrecht (2008)
for the Netherlands and by Arulampalam, Booth and Bryan (2005) for several European countries.

            The gaps between whites’ and non-whites’ incomes who reside in the northeast or in another
     region are also negative gaps. Except for the small business owners category, is that there are positive
     gaps in some points of the distribution. Just like in the decomposition by gender, the largest part of these
     lags come from the coefficients, which evidences the existence of discrimination. However, the
     proportion that comes from the workers’ characteristics is also negative. Such fact means that non-white
     individuals who reside in the northeast region have characteristics (years of education and experience)
     that make them get smaller incomes than those of white individuals or individuals who reside in other
     regions. The implementation of policies that promote social integration of these categories becomes
     highly advisable, in the light of the evidences shown herein.

distributions, as well as between whites and non-whites and northeast residents and other regions,
coming from the coefficients (discrimination)with a 95% trust interval. Some occupations show a glass
ceiling effect, that is, the lag is higher at the top of the distribution. That can be observed, for instance, in
the Professional General Directors and Managers category (P.G.D.M.), likewise in decompositions by
gender and by race, where the income hiatus is higher than 19% in the bottom part of the distribution and
higher than 30% at the top part. However, the incidence of a sticky floor effect is more likely. It is an
effect whose name was used by Arulampalam, Booth and Bryan (2005) for situations when the hiatus is
higher in the bottom part of the distribution.In the decomposition by regions, such effect is observed in
all occupational strata, indicating that discrimination decreases as distribution evolves.
        The results of the decomposition over all of the distribution can be better seen in graphs 9, 10 and
11, depicted in appendix F. It is clear the hiatus variation between the incomes along the quantiles and
between occupations. In the decomposition by ethnicity, for example, in the category of Professional
General Directors and Managers, the income differential significantly varies along the quantiles and does
a strikingly distinct trajectory, different from the trajectory seen in the Small Business Owners (S.B.O.)
category. Facts like these ratify the importance of disaggregated analysis of occupational strata and by
quantiles.
FINAL REMARKS
         By grouping hundreds of occupational categories (as they were characterized by the PNAD/2011
survey) into just five categories, and also by following the schematic EGP theoretical principle, an
analysis has been conducted herein, of the Brazilian urban job market, by occupational stratum.
         Quantile Mincer equations were estimated to test the effect of inherent and acquired attributes on
various quantiles along workers’ earning distribution. Abiding by the Machado and Mata (2005)
methodology, a decomposition of such distribution has been conducted in order to verify the earning
differentials between men and women, between whites and non-whites, between northeast region
residents and other regions’ residents. This procedure made it possible to evidence how much of the
difference between these categories’ incomes is caused by distinctions in characteristics (experience and
education) and how much of the difference is caused by dissimilarities in remuneration to such
characteristics, which conclusively means discrimination.
         The results of the quantile Mincer equations ratify the importance of disaggregated analysis of
occupational strata by quantiles, once the effects of the explanatory variables are distinct along income
distributions and do vary between occupations. This suggests an alternative and realistic view of Mincer
equations with variable coefficients, especially regarding human capital return. Variables such as years
of education and experience, bring on a growth effect on workers’ wages, mainly in the Professional
General Directors and Managers category. On the other hand, regional variables show that the wages
earned by workers who reside in the northeast is smaller, except for the Small Business Owners category.
         Regarding the gaps between men’s and women’s income distributions, between whites and non-
whites, and between northeast-region residents and other-region residents, some occupations display the
presence of glass ceiling effect, that is, the lag is bigger at the top of the distribution. However, in most
cases, there is a sticky floor effect, meaning that the hiatus is bigger in the bottom part of the
distribution. In the decomposition by region, such effect is observable in all occupational strata,
indicating that discrimination decreases as distribution progresses.
         Regarding the income differential between men and women, it is negative in all occupational
strata, expressively higher in the Unskilled Manual Laborers category and the proportion derived from
the characteristics is positive. It shows that wage differential is originated mainly from the coefficients,
that is, from remuneration to individual characteristics, which evidences discrimination by gender in the
Brazilian job market.
         Similarly, the gaps between the incomes of whites and non-whites as well as between the incomes
of northeast residents and other-region residents are negative. Solely in the Small Business Owners
category, and on few distribution points, these gaps are positive. These lags are mostly consequential to
coefficients that indicate discrimination. However, unlike to what happens to gender, the differentials are
also resultant from these workers’ distinct characteristics. This indicates that non-white individuals and
                                                                                                   13

northeast region residents have characteristics, such as years of education and experience, that cause
them to get smaller income than the income earned by white individuals and residents of other regions.
This fact confirms the imperativeness of policies that foster aid and the social integration of these
categories.
