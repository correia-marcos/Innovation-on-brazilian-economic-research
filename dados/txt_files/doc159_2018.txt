Resumo
Apesar da reconhecida associação entre tráficos de drogas e violência urbana no Brasil, há muito pouca
evidência confiável sobre tal relação e quase nenhuma quando se considera as vizinhanças das cidades. A
partir de um banco de informações para os bairros da Região Metropolitana do Recife e modelos
econométricos que consideram explicitamente a dependência especial, o trabalho apresenta evidências
que sugerem que o maior tráfico de drogas afeta positivimente a ocorrência de homicídios nos bairros
analisados (elasticidade em torno de 0.34%). Tal evidência é obtida mesmo depois de considerar a
influência de um grande conjunto de variáveis, incluindo condicionantes socieconômicos tradicionais da
violência e novos controles, como o percentual de domicílios dos bairros que pertencem a favelas e a
densidade de empregos em bares e restaurantes. Os resultados do trabalho também indicam que uma
parcela (15%) do efeito estimado decorre de spillovers do tráfico de drogas de bairros vizinhos sobre a
taxa de homicídio de cada localidade.

Abstract
Although it is amply recognized that part important of urban Brazilian violence is associated with drugs
traffic, formal and academic investigation is rare and almost inexistent when the focus are urban
neighborhoods. Using a unique data set of 261 Recife Metropolitan Region neighborhoods and spatial
econometric models, the paper presents evidence about the spatial correlation between drugs traffic and
homicide rates. The main evidence indicates a positive and robust association between homicide and
drugs traffic (homicide rate elasticity related to drugs traffic rate around 0.34%). This result is obtained
even after controlling for the influence of a large set of cofactors, including not only traditional
socioeconomic local conditionings of violence, but also the presence of slums and bar and restaurants
activities in the neighborhoods. Additional evidence also indicates that around 15% of the drugs traffic
influence on local violence arises from the influence of neighbors, i.e., it comes from spillovers effects
(indirect impacts).

Spatial Correlation Between Drugs Traffic and Violence in Brazil: Evidence from Urban
Neighborhoods
1. Introduction
         Presenting a homicide rate around 48 homicides per 100.000 inhabitants in 2016, much higher the
homicide rate observed for the Brazil as all and for the mean homicide rate for Brazilian capitals
(respectively, around 30 and 42 homicides per 100.000 inhabitants), Recife Metropolitan Region violence
situation appears to resemble the high urban violence of Brazilian big urban centers. Although certainly
there are multiple causes for this situation, data from the Social Defense Secretary of the State of
Pernambuco, Brazil, call the attention for the fact of almost 70% of homicides that occurred in the
Metropolitan Region of Recife in this year was motivated or presented some relationship with drugs
traffic or consume. Thus, this initial information suggests that part important of violence in the RMR can
be explained by drugs traffic or use.
        Curiously, although very suggestive, the role of drugs traffic or use for explaining the urban
violence is not yet much studied in applied empirical investigations. In fact, different researches have
been studying the determinants of homicide rates in Brazil (De Mello, 2007; Cerqueira, 2003, 2014;
Silva, 2014; Melo et al. 2016) and there are specific works on the conditionings of homicide rates in the
city of Recife (Menezes et al. 2013; Pereira et al. 2017), but the set of investigation focus mainly the role
of socioeconomic determinants of the urban violence. De Mello (2015) is one of the few exceptions.
Considering a panel of municipalities of the State of São Paulo, the author provides evidence of a causal
effect of crack traffic on homicides rate of the municipalities, but found no role for drugs consume. More
recently, Ratton et al. (2017) have analyzed the drugs market in the city of Recife and called the attention
that violence associated to the functioning of this market is intrinsically associated with the urban
violence verified in the city. The authors, however, do not provide any empirical systematic support for
this link.
        The objective of this paper is to provide empirical evidence of the spatial association between
drugs traffic and homicide rate in the Recife Metropolitan Region. Using data from 261 neighborhoods of
9 municipalities of the RMR (including Recife) and considering a large set of covariates, including not
only traditional socioeconomic ones (income, inequality, unemployment, etc.), but also information about
the presence of slums and bar and restaurant employment level in the neighborhoods, the research
considers different econometric models to estimate a reliable relationship between drugs traffic and
homicide rate. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, it provides empirical evidence about the
association between drugs traffic and urban violence in an important Brazilian Metropolitan Region,
something still rare, considering a unique set of control variables. Second, it considers this association
using neighborhoods information, a more appropriated spatial unity since drugs traffic and homicide are
very collocate within cities. Finally, we are able to measure spillovers effects from traffic drugs of
neighbor localities on the homicide rate of the neighborhoods.
        The results obtained indicate that a 1% increase of the drugs traffic rate is associated with a 0.34%
increase of the homicide rate of a neighborhood in RMR, evidence generated after controlling for large
set of covariates conditioning the local environment. We also found that around 15% of this effect is due
to spatial spillovers from neighbors localities, in other words, due to traffic drugs in these neighborhoods.
        The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present theoretical arguments for the existence
of a link between drugs traffic and urban violence, together with empirical evidence about this links. In
section 3, we present our empirical strategy and the data set. Section 4 presents and discusses the results
of the investigation. Final remarks are presented in section 5.
2. Drugs and urban violence

        As highlighted by Goldstein (1985), different possible channels can be present behind the
association relation between drugs and urban violence. According to this author, there is a possible
pharmacological relationship between drugs and violence explained by the change of behavior of drugs
users, who can become more socially aggressive and violent.
        In the same way, the nexus can be justified by economic motivation; the violence associated with
drugs would occur due the necessity of habits sustentation. In this way, drugs consume would motivate
different kinds of crimes, such robbery and homicide associated with it. Finally, there would be a
systematic channel associated with the general illegality character of the drugs use and traffic; because
there is no legal or institutional instances for conflicts intermediation, they tend to be solved through
violent confronts1.
         Note that these different channels are related to both drugs use (pharmacological relationship and
economic channels) and traffic (systematic channel). Based on the available set of empirical evidence
about them, however, the knowledge about the operation of the channels tends to present clear variation.
Johson, Golup, and Dunlap (2000) summarize the empirical results for US literature indicating that, while
the pharmacological channel appears less important, the economic one appears substantive. On the other
hand, according to the authors, much less is known about the systematic channel, the one more directly
involving drugs traffic. Corman and Mocan (2000) presented evidence indicating weak relationship
between drugs consume and property crime.
        As for Brazilian case, although the high level of urban violence and its potential association with
drugs use and traffic, most of the studies focus on the determinants of homicide rates use municipal or
state information and do not directly consider the role of drugs use or traffic (Cerqueira e Lobão, 2003;
De Mello, 2007; Carvalho and Lavor, 2009; Scorzafave and Soares, 2009; Cerqueira, 2014).
Furthermore, only recently more researches have considered within cities crimes variation. Menezes et al.
(2013) and Pereira et al. (2015) both considered the determinants of homicide rates in the city of Recife
using neighborhoods or census tracts. Similarly, Oliveira et al. (2017) have studied the determinants of
homicide rate in the city of Fortaleza using neighborhoods as unity of analysis. Generally motivated on
Becker (1968) approach for crime and sociological Theories of Social Disorganization and Collective
Efficacy (Shaw and Mackay, 1942; Sampson and Raudenbush, 1999), these works have considered
traditional socio-economic determinants of violence, such as income, inequality, urban density and
unemployment. None of these previous studies, however, have considered the local association between
drugs traffic or use and urban violence, which tend to be mainly present at neighborhood or local level.
Thus, it is much possible that the obtained correlations in these previous three works just reflect the worst
social conditions caused by the presence of drugs traffic or particular characteristics of the neighborhoods
associated with drugs traffic.
        The most convincing evidence of association between drugs traffic and violence in Brazil was
provided by De Mello (2015) using information for municipalities of São Paulo state. Using a panel of
municipalities, the author obtained evidence about a positive and causal association between crack traffic
and homicide rates. The results of this work also indicate that this kind of causality is not present when
considering crack use and homicide rates, supporting the idea that the association between drugs and
violence in theses municipalities is associated with the systematic channel. More recently, using a
national survey, Abdalla et al. (2018) presented statistics associating cocaine use and alcohol disorder
with higher chance of being a violent aggressor. These new evidence for all the country are totally in line
with De Mello (2015) evidence for São Paulo’s municipalities. Nevertheless, both evidence are not
obtained considering local within cities characteristics or social environment, thus, the results are quite
general and do not account to the fact that the relationship between drugs traffic and urban violence tend
be strongly spatial concentrated within cities locations.

1
    De Mello (2015) also provides a good discussion about these channels.
         The specificities of the drugs market in Recife have been study recently by Ratton et al (2017).
The authors empathize the difference between closed and open drug markets and the different associated
implications to urban violence. While in the closed markets the transaction are effective by mutual
knowledge between the parts and tend to happen in private environments, in the open markets the
transactions tend to happen in public environments and the dealers have much less knowledge about the
each other. Accordingly, because conflict solutions are difficult and there is less information, there would
be a stronger association between drugs traffic and urban violence in the second market. Note that the
argument support the idea that the association between drugs and violence in Recife present a clear
systematic channel and is consistent with the results obtained by De Mello (2015) for São Paulo
municipalities.
         Recent information about the association between drugs apprehension and violence provided by
Social Defense Secretary of the State of Pernambuco suggest a very strong association between drugs
traffic and homicide in Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR). According the official information and based
on state law regulating crimes occurrence, around 69% of homicides in RMR during the year of 2017
could be attributed to drugs traffic or use, a percentage higher than the one observed for the year of 2010
(less than 50%). The following Graphic 1 presents the distribution of homicides among different
categories of motivations according to this official source. These associations, of course, do not consider
any simultaneous events and local characteristics and, thus, can not be taken as reliable indicators2.

3. Empirical strategy
3.1 Model specification

      Although there are significant different levels of urban violence across cities, across
neighborhoods within cities criminality differences can be even more significant (Sampson, 2012).

2
  Drugs traffic or use attributions as causes of homicide by the official records are based on the official norm nº 357 of 2010 of
GACE/PE (Gerência de Analise Estatística Criminal/PE). According to this norm, the association between drugs and homicide
is established when the victim was a drug dealer or drug consumer or was involved in crime related to drugs activities.
Additionally, within areas or urban neighborhoods’ social characteristics or circumstances are much
better measured by traditional social indicators than when such indicators are used for representing cities
as all. Thus, we use the neighborhoods of the municipalities of RMR as analytic spatial unity for
obtaining a confident measure of association between drugs traffic and homicide rate and consider
regressing drugs traffic on homicide rate. Traditional endogeneity problems and spatial dependence in the
variables remains challenges to be dealt with.
        To deal with the last question, we incorporate the possibility of spatial dependence among the
variables by considering initially the following general spatial model (Lesage and Pace, 2009; Elhorst,
2014):

𝐻 = 𝛼 + 𝜌𝑊𝐻 + 𝑋𝛽 + 𝜃𝑊𝑋 + 𝜀                                                                (1)

𝜀 = 𝜆𝑊𝜀 + 𝜇                                                                               (2)

where, H is the homicide rate (matrix 261 x 1); X is a set of explicative variables (discussed in the
following lines), including drugs traffic (matrix 261 x k); W is a spatial weighting matrix (matrix 261 x
261); 𝛼, 𝜌, 𝛽, 𝜃, and 𝜆 are parameters; and 𝜇 is a normally distributed random term. Note that the
specification captures three different kinds of spatial influence: the effect from the spatial endogenous
variable (lag spatial of H), the influence from the neighborhoods’ explicative variable (WX), and the
possibility of spatial correlation in the residues (𝑊𝜀).
        As shown, for example, by Elhorst (2014), different specific models can be obtained assuming
different hypothesis about the spatial parameters (𝜌, 𝛽, 𝜆). Note, particularly, that SDEM (Spatial Durbin
Error Model), SDM (Spatial Durbin Model), and SAC (Spatial Auto-Regressive Combined Model) are
obtained assuming, respectively, 𝜌 = 0, 𝜆 = 0, and 𝜃 = 0. We use LM and Wald tests for choosing the
appropriated model specification.
        Maximum-likelihood or Instrumental Variable estimations can be used to estimate parameters for
the above models, dealing appropriately with possible endogeneity arising from spatial dependence (in
the case of specifications presenting a spatial lag endogenous variable as regressor). However, these
strategies are not enough for dealing tradition endogeneities problems (reverse causality and omitted
variable problems). Although we recognize they are possible not enough, we believe that the two
additional strategies we adopt strongly attenuate the problem. First, we avoid much of reverse causality
considering explicative variables measured in the year of 2010, while the dependent variable (homicide
rate) is measured for the years of 2013-2015. Second, we included in the variables X a great set of
potential determinants of homicide rate, part of them still not applied in Brazilian empirical works.
        As for the set of variables in X, following previous empirical works, such as Kelly (2000), Cook
(2009), Scorzafave and Soares (2009), and Menezes et al. (2013), we include traditional socioeconomic
and environmental conditionings of urban violence, all measured at neighborhoods levels. More
specifically, this set of variables includes per capita income, the Gini index for per capita income,
population, density, percentage of female as household-head, percentage of young people, percentage of
non-occupied household heads, and distance to Recife’s CBD.
        Motivated by broken-windows theory and using google images, He et al. (2017) recently showed
that local physical aspects are strongly associated with urban violence. Thus, similarly to Oliveira et al.
(2017), we also use the new information of 2010 Demographic Census to build a neighborhood
infrastructure index based on the % of residences in streets with regular garbage collection, % of
residences with street with culvert, % of residence in streets with public illumination, % of residences
with paved street, and % of residences in streets with sidewalk. We use Component Principal Approach
(PCA) to sum up these information and use the first and most important component to obtain an index of
around neighborhood infrastructure indicating the quality of local public environment. In the appendix,
we present eigenvalues, autovectors, and the expression used for obtaining this index.
       Finally, three more conditionings still not explored in Brazilian literature are considered. To
control for the degree of local guardianship, we also use the percentage of rented residences in the
neighborhoods as an additional regressor; according to Homevoter Hypothesis by Fischel (2005), given
the possibilities of capital losses, houses owners tend to be more worry about local environmental
occurrences and, thus, more involved in public guardianship than house renters. Second, because there is
the possibility of drugs traffic be concentrated in some specific poor neighborhoods, we also consider the
percentage of residences of the neighborhoods located in slums. This conditioning is important if the
presence of slums is both associated with homicide and drugs traffic.
       Third, using geocoding techniques applied to the address information of all formal sector firms of
the RMR, we built an additional variable measuring the density of employment in Bar and Restaurant
(number of occupations/area) for each neighborhood of the RMR3. As suggested by Gruenewald (2007),
in order to differentiate from the others establishments and to avoid stronger competition in places with
higher density of bars, some of them implement strategies favorable to heavy drinkers and people with
more risk for problems. Leidenfrost et al (2017) present some researches supporting this idea. Since this
density can be both associated with homicide and drugs traffic, to get a credible estimative for the
association between these occurrences, this influence must be controlled for.

3.2 Data

        The RMR is composed by Recife (capital of the state of Pernambuco) plus 13 others
municipalities. Because of inexistence of data for neighborhoods of 5 municipalities, we consider only the
others 9 municipalities: Abreu e Lima, Camaragibe, Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Igarassu, Itapissuma,
Jaboatão dos Guararapes, Olinda, Paulista e Recife4. For these municipalities, we collect and build
information for 261 neighborhoods.
        The data set of the investigation is based on three different sources of information. The
information about crimes was obtained from the Defense Secretary of the State of Pernambuco. The
information includes occurrence of homicides and drugs traffic registries for each neighborhoods for the
years 2013-2015. In order to avoid extreme volatility when registering occurrence at the neighborhood
level, we consider the average of homicide and drugs traffic registry rates (occurrence/100.000) in this
period. The logarithm of the average of the homicide rates is our dependent variable5.
        As for the other explicative variables, most of them are built using information from 2010
Demographic Census (per capita income, Gini index, population, density, % of female as household-head,
% of young people, % of non-occupied household heads, % of residences in streets with garbage
collection, % of residences with street with culvert, % of residence in streets with public illumination, %
of residences with paved street, and % of residences in streets with sidewalk, % of rented residences, and
% of residences of the neighborhoods located in slums). The values of these variables for the
neighborhoods were obtained aggregating the information from census tracks. From RAIS and Minister
of Finance, we use the information necessary (firms location and employment) to obtain the density of
employment in Bar and Restaurant in each neighborhood.
        Table 1 and Table 2 present, respectively, description and descriptive statistics of the variables and
the coefficients of correlation between the variables. We perceive none very high correlation coefficient
between any pairs of variables, which indicates that multicollinearity is not an important concern in our
estimative.

  The geocoding uses the QGis soft and information from RAIS (Relação Anual de Informações Sociais) database provided by
Minister of Labor and Employmen and data from Minister of Finance.
4
  The excluded municipalities are São Lourenço da Mata, Araçoiaba, Moreno, Vitória de Santo Antão, and Ipojuca. These
municipalities and are more peripheral (more distant from Recife) and less urban ones.
5
  Because some few neighborhoods present no occurrences during the period, in order to use logarithms, we added 1 to the
values of the crime rates.

4.1 Spatial distribution of drugs traffic and violence

In the following Figure 1, we present the spatial distributions of drugs traffic and homicide rates across
the 261 neighborhoods of the RMR. We first note that both types are quite unequally distributed across
neighborhoods; for homicide rate, for example, we notice that some neighborhoods present a value higher
than 700 homicides per 100.000 habitants and others presenting less than 2 homicides per 100.000
habitants. Thus, there is a great urban variation in violence conditions among neighborhoods for both
kinds of occurrences. Additionally, the two maps of Figure 1 suggest spatial association or dependence
for both kinds of crimes; in general, higher (lower) rates in a neighborhood tend to happen together with
its neighbors.
        From the Figure 1, we also observe that homicide rates are spatially spreader across
neighborhoods than drugs traffic rates. Specifically, while drugs traffic are clearly located in some
neighborhoods of the RMR around the CBD of Recife and in the north part of it, higher homicide rates
are found both around Recife’s CBD and in the neighborhoods in different peripheries of the RMR.
Interestingly and important for our next exercises, from the two maps of Figure 1, we note that, although
there many neighborhoods presenting both higher drugs traffic and homicide rates, we also found others
neighborhoods presenting lower drugs traffic and higher homicide rates. This specific evidence suggests
that the registration of the drugs traffic occurrences is not driven by the possible more frequent presence
of police force in neighborhoods with higher homicide rates and, thus, brings more confident for our
regression results.

        Nonetheless, as the evidence from Figure 2 shows, there is a clear positive association between the
kinds of crimes6. This positive association, of course, can arise from many different factors affecting both
kinds of crimes and, in order to get an credible measure of the influence of drugs traffic on homicide rate,
we try to eliminate them in our regression exercises.

  We use the logarithms in order to deals with the big difference between the numbers of registry between the two kinds of
crimes. Because some few neighborhoods present zero registry, we add the value 1 for all neighborhoods’ registry. Positive
association is also found using levels.

Furthermore, as the numbers of Table 3 show, there is another difficult for our next empirical
investigation, the spatial dependence of homicide rates among neighborhoods. Using two traditional
measure of spatial correlation (Moran’s I and Geray’s C) and different kinds of spatial weighting matrix,
the evidence form Table 3 indicates that we must strongly reject the hypothesis of no spatial dependence
among neighborhoods’ homicide rates. This indicates that, even eliminating more traditional problems of
endogeneity, in order to guarantee unbiased estimative, we have to adequately with this spatial
association (Anselin, 1988).

4.2 Drugs traffic affecting homicide in RMR

         In the Table 4, we present estimative of the coefficient of our econometric models we used to get a
credible association between drugs traffic and homicide rates in the RMR. As advanced, we start by
running a traditional OLS estimation considering a great number of different sets of controls; then, we use
statistical tests and information for comparing and choosing appropriated spatial econometric model.
         The estimative of Table 4 corresponding to OLS estimative indicates that, after taking in account
the influence of different variable that potentially affect neighborhood homicide rates, there is a positive
association between drugs traffic and homicide in RMR’s neighborhoods: a 1% increase of drugs traffic is
associated with a 0.3% increase of homicide rate. The neighborhoods’ homicide rate appears also
positively associated with population and the presence of slums and negatively associated with the
neighborhoods’ per capita income and demographic density.
        In order to consider spatial information and models, we need to consider a spatial weighting of
neighborhoods. After running spatial models for contiguity and 1-10 nearest neighbors’ matrices, we have
chosen the 5 nearest neighbors matrix because it presents the highest value of the Log-Likelihood
function7. Thus, we use the 5 nearest neighbors matrix for testing for spatial dependence and for deciding
about spatial models.
        From the OLS column of Table 4, we note that LM tests for spatial dependence (Anselin, 1988;
Anselin et al. 1996) do not reject the hypothesis of no spatial dependence when OLS is compared with a
Spatial Error Model (SEM), but they indicate rejection of the hypothesis in favor of a Spatial Auto-
Regressive Model (SAR). When considering the same tests applied to a XLS model (a model
incorporating spatially lag of explicative variables), they indicate that we cannot reject the hypothesis of
no spatial dependence in favor of either SE or SAR models (XLS columns of Table 4). Nevertheless,
using a LR test for choosing between XLS and OLS models, we get a statistic with value of 18.94 and a
p-value of 0.09, what favors OLS model. In addition, a Wald test for the coefficients of WX of the XLS
model generates a statistics of 1.47 and a p-value 0.135, providing more evidence in favor of the OLS
specification.
        Given this initial evidence favoring the SAR model, we also consider more general models
including the spatial endogenous variable (SDM and SAC models) and additional tests for choosing the
appropriated spatial econometric specification. The evidences are presented in Table 5 and correspond to
LR and Wald statistics for testing SDM and SAC models against alternative models. According to the
numbers of Table 5, both for LR or Wald statics tests, it not possible to reject the hypothesis that
alternative models (XLS, SAR or SEM) are preferable to the SDM. On the other hand, the bottom part of
Table 5 indicates that SAC is preferable to SEM, but not to the SAR model. Taking together, these two
additional evidences indicate that the SAR model is the most appropriated way for modeling the spatial
dependence present in the data. Thus, in the last column of Table 4, we present coefficient estimative for
the SAR model, including the one for the coefficient for the spatial lag of the endogenous variable8.

       While in OLS and XLS models the estimated coefficients indicate marginal effects of the
explicative variables, as argued by LeSage and Pace (2009), the presence of the spatial lag of the
endogenous variable as a regressor indicates the existence of feedbacks effects arising both from
neighborhoods own explicative variables and from neighbors explicative variables. Thus, in the SAR
models, the estimated coefficients do not represent the marginal effect of the explicative variables on the
homicide rate of the neighborhoods. The marginal effects are obtained by considering a SAR
specification of equations (1) and (2) and taking appropriate derivative. More specifically, from the
following SAR specification,

𝐻 = 𝛼 + 𝜌𝑊𝐻 + 𝑋𝛽 + 𝜇 ,                                                                                    (3)
we obtain the marginal effect of a variable Xj as:
𝜕𝐸(𝐻)
 𝜕𝑋𝑗
        = (𝐼𝑛 − 𝜌𝑊)−1 𝛽𝑗 .                                                                                 (4)

Note that the right side of equation (4) corresponds to a matrix (261 x 261), where the average of
principal diagonal elements measures the direct effect (influence from own explicative variable) and the
average of elements off of it corresponds to the indirect effect (influence from neighbors’ explicative
variable).
        We present direct and indirect marginal effects of the variables in the next Table 6. Two general
evidences must initially be highlighted. First, although not all estimative are statically significant at
standardized levels, except for the case of the percentage of unemployment9, all the neighborhood level
variable present the expected influence on homicide rates. Second, considering the statically significant
effects, we note that influences on homicide rates arise mainly from the direct effects, but, in all cases,
there are also spillovers effects arising from neighbors’ characteristics.
        More specifically, we observe a positive effects of the drugs traffic on homicide rate higher than
the one once obtained for OLS estimative or indicated by the SAR coefficient estimative (Table 4): a one
1% increase of drugs traffic is associated with a 0.34% increased in the homicide rate, being around 15%
of this influence coming from spillovers effect (indirect effect) of neighbors locations. Thus, the results
indicate that the homicide rate is not only positively affected by the drugs traffic presence in own
neighborhoods, but also by drugs traffic occurrence in their neighbor locations. Thus, our results are in
light with these obtained by Mello (2015), for the influence of drugs traffic on homicide rate using cities
of São Paulo, and by Abdalla et al. (2018), who highlighted the association between drugs and violence in
Brazil using a representative survey. In addition, our set of evidence also indicates the importance of
considering spatial dependence when studying urban homicides rates in Brazilian urban space.
        Similarly to Oliveira et al. (2017), who studied the determinants of homicide rates for the city of
Fortaleza using its neighborhoods, we also found negative effects of neighborhoods’ income and density
on homicide rate, these evidence are consistent, respectively, with higher opportunity costs of being
arrested associated with higher income (Becker, 1968; Bruckner, 2011) and with stronger public
guardianship (Sampson, 2012). But differently from the estimative of these authors, our evidence
indicates that these influence also come from spillovers from neighbor locations. Thus, in the case of
RMR’s neighborhoods, important spillover effects arise from richer and denser neighbor locations
helping to reduce homicides. The opposite happens for the effect of neighborhoods population influence
on homicide rate.
        Although presenting some similarities, our results present important differences when compared to
those obtained by Menezes et al. (2013), who considered the determinants of homicide rates using
exclusively the 94 neighborhoods of the city of Recife (discarding the neighborhoods of contiguous
municipalities), 2000 Demographic Census information, and homicide in the period 2008-2010. As these
authors, we also found a positive influence of neighborhoods’ population on homicide rates when
considering small urban areas of almost all RMR’s municipalities and this appears consistent with the
higher probability of convergence in time and space between victims and potential offenders, as

  We do not have a definitive explication for this effect, but we note that unemployment can be correlated with less regular
activities and public exposition. Actually, Silveira Neto and Moura (2018) have recently shown that a longer commuting time
increases the probability of being victim of robbery in the Brazilian metropolitan regions.
advocated by routine activities theory (Cohen and Felson, 1979; Cohen and Cantor, 1981). Nevertheless,
we did not find any evidence for the role of income inequality (Gini index)10 and, more important, we
obtained a positive parameter of the spatial lag endogenous variable ( ), indicating positive feedback
effects of homicide rates from neighbors. Thus, in our case, areas with low crime rates are not surrounded
by neighborhoods with high murder rates as defended by those authors, but the opposite. In other words,
our evidence indicates that the higher the urban violence in its neighbors’ areas, the higher tends to be the
violence in the neighborhoods of RMR.

5. Final Remarks

        Although drug traffic is commonly associated with the very high level of urban violence in Brazil,
few studies have provided convincing evidence that this association does not merely reflect cofactors
affecting both circumstances, such as local infrastructure or location of bars or other events. Furthermore,
the most reliable available evidence about a potential causal association from drugs traffic and violence
was obtained comparing municipalities (De Melo, 2015) and, thus, ignoring the fact that both drug traffic
and violence are within cities spatial located events. In this research, we contribute to attenuate both

     This specific results is also similar to the one obtained by Oliveira et al. (2017).
limitations by providing evidence of the association between drugs traffic and homicide rate in 261
neighborhoods of RMR.
         Using a unique data set from different and complementary sources (2010 Demographic Census,
State Secretary of Social Defense, and RAIS), we were able to consider an important and unique set of
control variables, including the share of households in slums and density of employment in Bars and
Restaurants, and, applying econometric spatial models, we obtain a strong and reliable association
between drugs traffic and homicide rate for RMR’s neighborhoods. According to our estimative, a 1%
increase of the drugs traffic rate is associated with 0.34% increase of the homicide rate, being 15% of this
effect generated by neighbor locations (i.e., due to spillovers from neighbors). The evidence, thus,
supports the systematic association between drugs and violence proposed by Goldstein (1985) and is in
line with the results of De Mello (2015) and the drugs market characteristics in the RMR discussed by
Ratton et al. (2017).
         Although it is not possible to guarantee that we have obtained a causal relationship between drugs
traffic and homicide rate, the quantity and quality of the controls variable used in the investigation and the
fact that reverse causality is not apparent in our data make our results at least very suggestive. The
investigation could be improved by considering instrumental variables for drugs traffic (for example, the
location of residence of consumer of drugs or the share of different cohorts in the neighborhoods in past
decades) and by using the share of drugs traffic in the total of official violence registries.

Appendix: infrastructure index based on PAC
       The urban infrastructure index we used in the regressions is based on the results of Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and it is similar to the one used by Oliveira et al. (2017). The vector of
variables is composed by the % of residences in streets with regular garbage collection (C1), % of
residences with street with culvert (C2), % of residence in streets with public illumination (C3), % of
residences with paved street (C4), and % of residences in streets with sidewalk (C5). The following Table
A1 presents the principal components (autovectors) and associated eigenvalues.

       Similar to Oliveira et al. (2017), we also use the PC1 to obtain an urban infrastructure index for
each neighborhood j given by:
                                    𝑦𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑦𝑗
       𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑗 = 𝑦                                                               (A1)
                                    𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑛

where 𝑦𝑗 is the value of PC1 for the neighborhood j, 𝑦𝑚𝑎𝑥 corresponds to the maximum value of y, and
𝑦𝑚𝑖𝑛 corresponds to the minimum value of y. Thus, the formula allows obtaining a set of values between
0 and 1 for the 261 neighborhoods of the RMR
