          The interest in this paper lies in the environmental costs of the European Union
      (EU). EU membership requires a series of economic and political changes that should
      impact the country's production and consumption structures and its trade relation-
      ships. These, in turn, will aect CO2 emissions sources and levels. This is especially
      true for the former Soviet Union countries that recently joined the EU, given the
      dierence in their levels of development and production structure. Using a struc-
      tural decomposition analysis we are able to quantify the main drivers of changes
      in emissions dierentiating six components, namely: emissions intensity, industrial
      structure and sourcing, consumer preferences, nal demand sourcing and consump-
      tion level. Grouping the countries into ve clubs, New European Union countries,
      Old European Union countries, the United States of America, China, and the Rest
      of the World, we measure trading pattern changes and their impact on CO2 emission
      levels.

1    Introduction
There is a major transformation underway in international trade ows that is intensied
by multilateral trading system agreements and the transition from a Fordist to a more
exible production system in many world economies. The consequence of this transfor-
mation in international trade is greater production and commercial integration among
countries, the insertion of certain economies into specialized markets in the world, the
expansion of production scale, and the fragmentation of the production and distribution
of supplements, i.e. intermediate inputs and logistic processes. Among these transforma-
tions, we can highlight the trade dissociation of consumption and production, as well as
increases in the consumption and production of goods, which leads to economic growth.
Thus, the world has become increasingly integrated, given the technological advances es-
pecially in the elds of communication and information, the reduction of trade barriers,
and foreign investments.
    One instrument that fosters the increase of international trade, and is of particu-
lar importance to this paper, is the formation of monetary unions or free trade areas.
There are costs and benets involved in participating in such agreements. From the costs
perspective, one can note the loss of monetary policy as a macroeconomic tool for sta-
bilization. From the benets side, one can point to the increase in trade, investment,
and diversication of consumption basket (Micco et al., 2003). A large part of the trade
literature focuses on the impacts of the formation of the European Economic and Mon-
etary Union (EU) showing that this has a considerable eect on the member countries'
patterns of international trade, e.g., Bun and Klaassen (2002); Micco et al. (2003); Barr
et al. (2003); De Nardis and Vicarelli (2003); Flam and Nordstr√∂m (2006); de Sousa and
Lochard (2004); Faruqee (2004); Baldwin et al. (2005).

    The interest in this paper lies in the environmental costs of EU related economic re-
structuring. From an historical perspective, there have been dierent waves of entrance
into the EU. For the specic aim of this paper, we are interested in the wave that oc-
curred in the 2000s. Cyprus, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Malta, Poland, and the Czech Republic joined EU in 2004, while Bulgaria and Romania
joined the EU in 2007. As discussed by Barlow and Radulescu (2005); Grosjean et al.
(2013); BenYishay and Grosjean (2014); Tarabar and Young (2017) and Tarabar (2017),
EU membership requires a series of economic and political changes that should impact
the country's production and consumption structure and its trade relationships. These
institutional reforms aected the productivity of these economies (Drield et al., 2013),
which in turn, should aect the CO2 emissions level and source (Brizga et al., 2013; Malik
and Lan, 2016; Bae et al., 2017). This is especially true for countries that entered the
EU recently since there is a clear distinction in levels of development, and perhaps more
interestingly, because most of these countries were part of the Soviet Union (USSR). Our
hypothesis is that the entrance of new countries into EU should increase the trade among
these countries and the EU's old members which would increase or change the structure
of emissions (Levinson, 2009; Douglas and Nishioka, 2012; Brunel, 2017; Levinson, 2015;
Shapiro and Walker, 2015). Thus, this paper contributes to better understanding the
spatial pattern of CO2 emissions, considering the economic and political reforms towards
a more market-based economy occurring in former soviet countries upon joining the EU.
    Although there are gains linked to the evolution and growth of the world economy due
to the increase in the international trade, this process can be accompanied by negative
externalities, such as environmental degradation, deforestation, and pollution, among
others. Hence, free trade can have contradictory eects. On the on hand, it can facili-
tate the consumption and production of goods, which leads to economic growth which,
consequently can contribute to increase pollution. On the other hand, free trade-induced
economic growth leads to an increase in GDP and the willingness to pay for environmen-
tal improvement and the adoption of greener production technologies (Choi et al., 2010;
Shahbaz and Leit√£o, 2013; Sharma, 2011).
    According to Hoekstra et al. (2016), this scenario of changes in trade patterns and
growth of trade volume had a strong inuence on distribution of environmental pressures
among countries, in particular for CO2 emissions. The dissociation between consumption
and production mentioned earlier enables transferring the emission burden of production
from one country to another (Dietzenbacher et al., 2012; Oshita, 2012; Xu and Dietzen-
bacher, 2014; Lan et al., 2016; Malik and Lan, 2016; Vale et al., 2018). For the specic
case of CO2 emissions, the actual scenario for developed countries presents a trend of
stabilization of national emissions, but with an increase in the global emissions rooted in
their consumption. As for developing countries, both consumption and production are
sources of increasing emissions, but emissions from production side increase more than
those from consumption side. Therefore, developing countries are generating emissions
that are rooted in their exports to developed countries. Thus, the net imports of emis-
sions by the majority of developed countries increased and the same pattern occurred
for the net exports of emissions by the majority of developing countries (Arto and Diet-
zenbacher, 2014). It is important to highlight that this process is also motivated, at a
certain level, by the low production cost and moderate environmental regulations of the
developing countries. Hence, there is an incentive for developed countries to outsource

their production process (Grether and Mathys, 2013; Zhang et al., 2017).
    To quantify the main causes of changes in emissions, we employ a structural decompo-
sition analysis (SDA), in line with those developed by Oosterhaven and Van Der Linden
(1997); Arto and Dietzenbacher (2014) and Hoekstra et al. (2016), which enables us to
disentangle the dierent drivers of such changes, namely: emissions intensity, industrial
structure and sourcing, consumer preferences, nal demand sourcing and consumption
level. We use the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) and the countries grouped
into ve clubs or regions: New European Union countries (NEU), Old European Union
countries (OEU), the United States of America (USA), China (CHN), and the Rest of
the World (ROW). By creating these groups, we are able to quantify emissions costs of
the entrance of the new countries into the EU. The advantage of using an input-output
model is the possibility of performing a systematic analysis of the economies of these
countries through industrial linkages. Thus, we are able to map direct and indirect links
in the structure of intermediary and nal goods trade between these countries using
inter-sectoral and inter-regional interdependence relationships.
    The main results show that changes in economic structure, driven by market reforms
and new institutions in the NEU club are important to explain the changes in CO2
emissions. Although NEU countries diminished their emissions intensity, i.e., emission-
output ratio, the total emissions increased. This increased emissions are due to an increase
trade with OEU countries, especially the transfer of emission in nal goods exports. These
results are important because the environmental costs are not associated with domestic
production only. As new countries join the EU or other trade agreement regions, we
should expect a change in the sourcing of intermediate and nal goods. The facilitated
access to new technology should help mitigate but not overcome these sourcing costs.
    In the remainder of the paper, we proceed as follows. Section 2 describes the structural
decomposition analysis methodology and the World Input Output Database (WIOD); sec-
tion 3 presents our results; and, section 4 concludes, providing some policy implications.


2     Method and data
2.1    Method

The Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) is a standard method based on input-
output models that allows the division of changes in output, income or other variables
into explanatory factors, such as technological variation or nal demand variation (Miller
and Blair, 2009). We follow the work of Xu and Dietzenbacher (2014) and Hoekstra
et al. (2016) and extend the SDA for a Multi-Region Input-Output (MRIO) model and
to assess the eect of dierent groups of countries in CO2 emission in terms of sourcing.
    Starting from a standard MRIO with M regions indexed by superscripts t and r,
and N industries indexed as i, j , we can dene its main components as gross output (x),
intermediate interindustry and inter-country transactions (Z ), and industry nal demand
(f ). The classic input-output relationship holds, such that x ‚â° Z + f ‚â° Ax + f , in which
A = Z(xÃÇ)‚àí1 is the multi-regional technical coecient matrix, and xÃÇ is the diagonal matrix
vector x. If we solve this for the output, then, x = Lf , where L = (I ‚àí A)‚àí1 denoting
the Leontief inverse multiplier matrix.
    Dene ei as the emission intensity, i.e., the amount of CO2 emission per unit of output


                                             4
i. Hence, we can incorporate the emission level into our framework as:

                                       s = eÃÇx = eÃÇLf                                     (1)
where s is the vector of total emissions directly and indirectly required to satisfy nal
demand.
    As previously discussed, to enter EU countries should face economic and political
reforms that in turn will aect their production structure. For instance, the reduced or
non-existing trade taris within the EU should incentivize new members to trade more
intermediate goods with old member and vice-versa. Also, households should have access
to a dierent basket of goods and services. Both these changes should have an impact on
the emission levels from new members and old members of EU. Therefore, by breaking
down the change in emission levels in dierent components we are able to trace which are
the main drivers of CO2 emissions, namely, changes in energy intensity, in the countries'
production structure, in the sourcing countries, or changes in nal demand mix of goods
and level of consumption.
    We want to analyze emissions considering possible changes in sourcing patterns that
occurred after the entry of new members into the EU. Therefore, we need to dierentiate
technology changes, i.e., changes in the production structure, from changes in sourcing
of intermediate goods. For example, there may be no change in how a good is being
produced, but only from where a country is acquiring its input. The same is true in case
of nal demand; there can be a change in the level and mix of goods, such that this mix
can be broken down into types of goods and sourcing of goods. We follow Oosterhaven
and Van Der Linden (1997) and Hoekstra et al. (2016) and dierentiate the origin of
emission in ve clubs: new EU members (NEU), old EU members (OEU), USA, China
(CHN) and the Rest of the World (ROW).
    To properly disentangle these components let us dene Z ‚àót = [zij‚àót = r zijrt ] as the
                                                                                  P
total input requirementsÔ£Æof industry j for     Ô£π input of industry i in country t. Using Z we
                                                                                          ‚àót
                              ‚àó1           ‚àóM
                            Z    ... Z
                              .
can create Z ‚àó = [Z ‚àót ] ‚â° Ô£∞ ..   ..        .. Ô£∫, which is the intermediate input requirements
                                     .       . Ô£ª

                            Z    ... Z
regardless of the source country. In practice, the Z ‚àó matrix is the horizontal stacking
of Z ‚àót which is then vertically stacked M times. The Z ‚àót is used to create the trade
coecient matrix C = [cij = zijrt /zij‚àó ], which indicates the fraction of intermediate demand
for total (worldwide) products i, for industry j in country s, that is actually satised by
the supply from country r. Similarly, we can dene a matrix F that will capture the
trade coecients for the nal demand, and is created following the same steps presented
above.
    Matrices C and F , which allow the identication of each sourcing groups or clubs, are
key to our decomposition strategy. The intuition is that C and F give us the weighted
importance in trade for each country. Let A‚àó = Z ‚àó (xÀÜ‚àó )‚àí1 . Thus, dening A = C ‚ó¶ A‚àó ,
and f = (F ‚ó¶ B)y ‚â° Gy ,P   in which the symbol ‚ó¶ is the Hadamard product, i.e. cell-by-cell
multiplication, and y = r fijrt , we can re-write equation 1 as:

                           s = eÃÇLGy = eÃÇ(I ‚àí C ‚ó¶ A‚àó )‚àí1 (F ‚ó¶ B)y                         (2)

2.1.1   Decomposition Analysis

The starting point for the decomposition of changes in CO2 emissions between two period
of time (‚àÜs = s1 ‚àí s0 ) is the polar decomposition analysis by Dietzenbacher and Los
(1998):

                      ‚àÜs = (‚àÜeÃÇ)L1/2 G1/2 y1/2    emission intensity
                         + eÃÇ1/2 (‚àÜL)G1/2 y1/2   industry structure
                                                                                       (3)
                         + eÃÇ1/2 L1/2 (‚àÜG)y1/2 consumption pattern
                         + eÃÇ1/2 L1/2 G1/2 (‚àÜy)   consumption level
where the subscript 1/2 is the average of both period of times.
     Two of the most interesting components of equation 3 for our analysis are the industry
structure and consumption pattern terms. By using the matrices C and F described above
it is possible to further decompose these terms to properly identify changes in technical
coecients and changes in trade coecients.
     Start with ‚àÜL = L1 ‚àí L0 = L1 (‚àÜA)L0 . As A = C ‚ó¶ A‚àó , then by simple substitution
we have ‚àÜL = L1 ‚àí L0 = L1 ‚àÜ(C ‚ó¶ A‚àó )L0 . Pre and post multiplying it for (I ‚àí A1 ) and
(I ‚àí A0 ), respectively:

                       ‚àÜL = L1 (C1/2 ‚ó¶ ‚àÜA‚àó )L0 + L1 (‚àÜC ‚ó¶ A‚àó1/2 )L0                    (4)
where the rst term L1 (C1/2 ‚ó¶ ‚àÜA‚àó )L0 is the eect of the actual changes in the technical
coecients, and the second term L1 (‚àÜC ‚ó¶ A‚àó1/2 )L0 indicates the eect of the changes in
the trade coecients.
   Similarly, using G = F ‚ó¶B , it is possible to rewrite ‚àÜG as ‚àÜG = ‚àÜF ‚ó¶B1/2 +F1/2 ‚ó¶‚àÜB .
Thus, using this plus equation 4, it is possible to re-write equation 3 as:

            ‚àÜs = (‚àÜeÃÇ)L1/2 G1/2 y1/2                          emission intensity
                                      ‚àó
               + eÃÇ1/2 [L1 (C1/2 ‚ó¶ ‚àÜA )L0 ]G1/2 y1/2         technology change
               + eÃÇ1/2 [L1 (‚àÜC ‚ó¶ A1/2 )L0 )]G1/2 y1/2 intermediate trade source
                                    ‚àó
                                                                                       (5)
                + eÃÇ1/2 L1/2 (F1/2 ‚ó¶ ‚àÜB)y1/2             consumer preferences
                + eÃÇ1/2 L1/2 (‚àÜF ‚ó¶ B1/2 )y1/2             nal demand source
                + eÃÇ1/2 L1/2 G1/2 (‚àÜy)                      consumption level
    Lastly, since we explore the entrance of former USSR countries in the EU as a shock
to a country's trade pattern, we follow Hoekstra et al. (2016) and split the C and F
matrices to reect the geographic origin of the inputs. Dene cr as a (M N xM N ) matrix
and dr as a (M xM N ) matrix, both with ones for industries in each club r and zeros in
all other industries. Then, we can re-write equation 5 to incorporate them, as such:

2.2     Data

The data to quantify the drivers of changes in CO2 emissions and identify the environ-
mental costs of EU come from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). This database
provides a time-series of the World Input-Output Tables (WIOTs) covering the period
of 1995 to 2011. These tables have been constructed in a clear conceptual framework on
the basis of ocially published input-output tables in conjunction with national accounts
from national statistical institutes around the world and international trade statistics
such as OECD and UN National Accounts (Dietzenbacher et al., 2013; Timmer et al.,
2015).
    The WIOD covers 27 EU countries and 13 other major countries in the world and
a model for the rest of the world. These 40 countries represent approximately 90% of
world trade. The WIOTs provide details for 35 industries classied according to the
International Standard Industrial Classication revision 3. The WIOD also provides the
environmental satellite accounts for emissions expressed in Megatonne (Mt) of CO2 at
the industry level.
    Thus, WIOD we create ve groups1 of countries to quantify emissions costs of the
entrance of the new countries into the EU. Given our focus, the rst two groups are
straightforward: New European Union countries (NEU) and Old European Union coun-
tries (OEU). The other three groups are the United States of America (USA), China
(CHN), and the Rest of the World2 (ROW) were based on the relative importance in
terms of trade with NEU countries.
   1 NEU : Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Ro-
mania, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia; OEU : Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland,
France, United Kingdom, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Sweden;
ROW : Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Taiwan,
and Turkey.
   2 Although Russia was the main country of the USSR, its trade balance with NEU group is smaller
than the other groups. For instance, in 1995 Russia share of exports and imports from NEU were
10.1% and 17.1%, respectively; in 2007, its exports and imports share from NEU were 7.8% and 15.1%,
respectively. Moreover, a preliminary network analysis based on trade balances provides little support
for Russia to be a separate club. This analysis is available upon request. Therefore, we decided to
aggregate the results of Russia in the ROW. Nevertheless, he participation of Russia of the emissions
changes in the ROW between 1995-2007 was: 26.2% of the technology component, 26.9% of the sourcing
component, and 15.4% of the consumption component.


                                                     7
   The SDA requires the use of input-output tables expressed in constant prices to an-
alyze the structural changes across dierent periods. Therefore, we have used the input-
output tables in previous year's prices available from WIOD and chained the outcomes in
the year-to-year changes.3 Thus, for the change in 1996, we have used the input-output
tables of 1995 (in current prices) and 1996 (in constant prices of 1995). Also, follow-
ing Arto and Dietzenbacher (2014) and Xu and Dietzenbacher (2014), the results have
been cumulated over the full sample period. We consider only the period 1995-2007 to
avoid the dramatic inuence of the 2008 nancial crisis on the ow of world trade and
consequently the emission transfers through exports.

for the ve clubs (NEU, OEU, USA, CHN and ROW) presented as a percentage change4
of the global emissions. The eects are aggregated into three categories: technology
(emissions intensity and industrial structure), sourcing (industry and nal demand) and

    The overall increase in CO2 emissions in the period was 6,343.9 Mt. The result of the
decomposition shows an increase in total emissions in the OEU (3.1%), USA (5.6%), CHN
(44.3%) and ROW (47.6%). Only the NEU club reveals a reduction in total emissions
(-0.7%). These results reinforce previous evidence that, among the few countries that
managed to reduce emissions in the 1990s and 2000s, most of these countries emerged
from the former Soviet Union (Brizga et al., 2013).
    For all clubs there was a reduction in emission due to the emissions intensity (e)
of -7,142.3 Mt, which means that there was a more ecient use of fuels. However,
the eects of technological changes on the industrial structure component (L) reduced
emissions only in the NEU (-1.4%) and in the USA (-9.9%). The reduction of emissions
through technological changes (A) was driven by productivity gains (Y√∂r√ºk and Zaim,
2005) and research and development investments in low-carbon technologies (Steinberger
    3 Los        (2014)detail the procedures for the construction of WIOTs in previous year's prices.
            et al.
    4 Table   A1 in the Appendix shows the results of the decomposition of the emissions into Mt of CO2 .

                                                     8
and Roberts, 2010). However, the reduction of emissions driven by the technological
component was overcome by the increase in the consumption level (171.8%, equivalent
to 10,896.3 Mt of CO2 ).
    Global trade was responsible for the 18.1% increase in total emissions. The transfer
of emissions through a change in sourcing patterns was negative only in the OEU (-
2.2%) and in the USA (-5.3%). Change in sourcing patterns, in the countries with
emission-intensive technologies, that is, those countries that have higher CO2 emissions
per unit of production, was responsible for the 25.6% increase in global emissions 
NEU (0.5%), CHN (20.1%) and ROW (5.0%), which corresponds to the increase of the
emissions embodied in exports (Table 1). The sourcing eect transferred 1,148.6 Mt of
CO2 distributed between NEU (30.6 Mt), CHN (1,274.1 Mt) and ROW (316.8 Mt) as
shown in Table A1 in the Appendix.
    Figure 1 shows the evolution of the CO2 emissions decomposition between 1995 and
2007 for NEU and OEU clubs. This represents the accumulated change in emissions
for each year from 1996 to 2007. Tables A2.1 and A2.2 in the Appendix presents the
variation in sectorial emissions for each component of the decomposition and for each
country club.
    The OEU club's emissions increased 198.9 Mt of CO2 over this period. Changes in
the NEU club's emissions, also showed an increasing trend, except for the period be-
tween 1997 and 1999, accumulating a reduction of -42.2 Mt of CO2 (Figure 1.1). The
reduction in total emissions in the NEU club was driven mainly by changes in the in-
dustrial structure component, in particular in the electricity production industry (Table
A3.1 in the Appendix). This reduction was boosted by market reforms that the NEU
club went through after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, such as privatization, en-
terprise restructuring and competition policy (BenYishay and Grosjean, 2014; Tarabar,
2017). These reforms had strong eects in the electricity industry in Central and Eastern
Europe during the 1990s; this in turn, increased their energy eciency and mitigated
CO2 emissions (Stern and Davis, 1998; Pesic and √úrge-Vorsatz, 2001). In addition to
improved energy eciency, the European Union climate policy contributed to reduced
CO2 emissions in the post-Soviet Union countries (Bae et al., 2017).
    Technology changes generated variations of emissions in the NEU of -378.1 Mt of
CO2 and in -556.9 Mt of CO2 in the OEU (Figure 1.2). The technological changes in the
NEU were composed by the reduction of -291.8 Mt of CO2 from the emissions intensity
component (related to eciency in the use of fuels), concentrated in the following indus-
tries: electricity (-65.4 Mt), metals (-47.9 Mt), chemicals (-33.9 Mt) and non-metallic
(-33.4 Mt). Further, the NEU club reduced the emissions in -86.3 Mt originating in the
industrial structure component  with the reduction of -107.1 Mt of CO2 in the electricity
industry. The reduction in emissions in the OEU club, through technology changes, oc-
curred only in the emissions intensity component (-711.4 Mt); meanwhile, the industrial
structure component increased emissions by 154.6 Mt of CO2 .
    Sourcing patterns change generated a change in emissions of -137.2 Mt for the OEU
club and 30.6 Mt for the NEU club (Figure 1.3). The increase in emissions in the NEU club
through sourcing matches the period of entry of these countries into the European Union.
The cost of increasing CO2 emissions in the NEU through the change in sourcing patterns,
is related to the greater insertion of the countries of this club in the global production
chains. In these supply chains, production is fragmented in dierent territories, with the


                                            9
tendency of emission-intensive activities to be shifted to low-income countries (Hoekstra
et al., 2016; Vale et al., 2018).

    In this context, Bae et al. (2017) identied that the increased inow of foreign direct
investment in the countries of the former Soviet Union also increased its CO2 emissions;
this increase has not been fully oset by improved energy eciency and EU climate policy.
Malik and Lan (2016) also identied in an analysis for 186 countries from 1990 to 2010
that changes supply chain to improve technological eciency are not sucient to reduce
emissions. Therefore, although the NEU club enjoys greater welfare resulting from the
increase of income after its insertion into the EU, this club also loses welfare due to the
environmental cost of the CO2 emissions.
    The CO2 emissions through the consumption component (Figure 1.4) has increased
over time for the NEUs (305.4 Mt) and the OEUs (892.9 Mt). Although the consumer
preferences component, which measures a change in emissions due to changes in nal
consumption basket, has reduced emissions by -39.4 Mt in the NEU and -16.9 Mt in
the OEU. Therefore, while increased incomes in these countries have increased emissions
through higher consumption level, there was a reduction in emissions due to the change
in the composition of nal demand. Thus, the economic development of these countries

                                            10
created a shift from consumption of fuels and food to manufactured goods with lower
emission intensity.
    Emissions reduction due to change in consumer preferences was generated mainly in
agriculture, rened petroleum and nuclear fuel industry and electricity industry (for the
NEU club: -5.4 Mt, -6.7 Mt and -39.9 Mt; for the OEU club: -6.1 Mt, -8.3 Mt and
-27.6 Mt, respectively). Emissions increase in the OEU consumer preferences component
between 2002 and 2006 was concentrated in the electricity industry of Germany and
United Kingdom (in 2002) and the mining and quarrying industry in Greece (between
2003 and 2006).
    The overall change in OEU club emissions was higher than in the NEU club; this is
an indirect consequence of the size of these countries' economies. While the NEU club
concentrates 2.0% of the world's value added, the OEU club generates 26.8% of this
additional value. To control for this eect, the change in emissions were divided by the
total added value of each club. The NEU club presented the highest changes in emissions
when taking into account the size of the production. This can be explained by greater
intensity in the generation of emissions in the NEU club. Although NEU countries have
been able to reduce their emission levels, they still have a lower level of energy eciency
compared to the OEU countries.
    SDA's results were also partitioned into emissions associated with domestic activities
and associated with international trade. Thus, it is possible to identify to what extent the
outsourcing of production across national borders on the transfer aect emission levels.
The change in emissions through increasing foreign outsourcing is detailed in Figure 2,
which highlights the shift in sourcing patterns for the NEU and OEU clubs. The complete
results for each SDA eect are presented in Tables A2.1 and A2.2 in the Appendix.
    The shift in sourcing patterns captures the environmental costs of emissions embodied
in international trade, which has been impacted by the fragmentation of global production
(Zhang et al., 2017). Emissions growth embodied in imports (168.0 Mt) was lower than
the emissions realized in exports (213.5 Mt) in the NEU club between 1995 and 2007. This
emissions transfer through imports was caused by trade between the NEU club members
(26 Mt), OEU (42.0 Mt), USA (4.3 Mt), CHN (43.9 Mt) and ROW (51.8 Mt) clubs. On
the other hand, in the OEU the growth of emissions embodied in imports (1,266.6 Mt)
was larger than the growth of emissions embodied in exports (554.4 Mt). Global CO2
emissions to cover imports into the OEU club originated in the trade between OEU club
members (205.9 Mt), NEU (106.7 Mt), USA (34.4 Mt), CHN (371.4 Mt) and ROW (548.3
Mt). Xu and Dietzenbacher (2014) and Grether and Mathys (2013) also identied that
the growth of emissions embodied in imports from developed countries is greater than
the growth of emissions embodied in exports.

    Sourcing pattern change was responsible for an increase of 30.6 Mt of CO2 in NEU
emissions (-4.4 Mt in the intermediate inputs trade and 34.9 Mt in the supply of nal
products and services), while domestic sourcing eect reduced its emissions by -99.7 Mt
of CO2 (Figure 2.1). The transfer of emissions from NEU to OEU, due to a change in the
patterns of trade, was 88.8 Mt of CO2 . This export of emissions, through outsourcing of
production, was caused by the supply of intermediate inputs (41.4 Mt) and nal products
(47.4 Mt). This result provides supporting evidence that OEU club is transferring the

                                          12
emission-intensive production to the NEU club evidenced by Lan et al. (2016); Malik and
Lan (2016); Hoekstra et al. (2016); Vale et al. (2018).
    Lower production costs and less stringent environmental regulations in the NEU club
may have been one of the incentives for the OEU club to outsource its production in those
countries. This is an environmental cost that accompanies welfare benets generated by
the greater economic integration between NEU and OEU. The emissions transfer among
countries that make up the NEU club also suggests that economic integration among the
countries of this club has remained small in spite of an increase since 2003 (Figure 2.1).
    Sourcing eect in the OEU club reduced emissions by -137.2 Mt of CO2 or -2.2% of
global emissions. This reduction was driven mainly by the eect of domestic sourcing
(-238.7 Mt) due to the change in the patterns of trade within each country of the club;
even though emissions increased by 43.7 Mt of CO2 due to an integration among the
countries within the club. The transfer of emissions embodied in exports from OEU to
NEU increased global emissions by only 9.0 Mt of CO2 (Figure 2.2); this transfer was
concentrated in the trade of intermediate inputs (5.4 Mt, i.e., 60.0%).
    Figure 3 shows the change in CO2 emissions for the studied period. Romania (-22.9
Mt) and Poland (-20.0 Mt) were the driver of total reductions in CO2 emissions in the
NEU club during the period from 1995 to 2007. Although Germany reduced its total
emissions (-21.5 Mt), the increase in CO2 emissions in the OEU club was mainly caused
by Spain (84.5 Mt), Denmark (33.5 Mt), Italy (28.3 Mt), and Greece (22.3 Mt). The
reduction of emissions in the OEU club through changes in its production structure, which
aected sourcing patterns (-137.2 Mt), occurred mainly in the United Kingdom (-81.9
Mt), Italy (-34.2 Mt), Greece (-27.5 Mt), and Netherlands (-13.2 Mt), whilst Germany
(18.1 Mt) increased emissions exports. As for the NEU club, Poland (39.0 Mt), Estonia
(10.9 Mt), and Czech Republic (8.1 Mt) made the largest emissions transfers through
outsourcing of production. On the other hand, Romania (-19.8 Mt) and Bulgaria (-10.3
Mt) have reduced emissions embodied in exports.

    The contribution of each country to changes in CO2 emissions considering the size of
its economy is presented in Figure 4, as the ratio of total emissions to the value added of
each country. In the NEU club, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovak Republic and Poland were the
most intensive countries in reducing CO2 emissions. In the OEU club, Denmark, Greece,
Spain and Finland are responsible for the largest increases in emissions proportional to the
size of their value added. Figure 4 also shows the interregional CO2 emissions multiplier
for each country. The total reduction of the emissions in the NEUs is reected on the CO2
emissions multiplier, which identies the ability of these countries to propagate emissions
through their industrial linkages in the global production structure (Figure A1 in the
Appendix).

Emissions Multiplier




    The main source of this reduction occurred in the electricity industry, and rened
petroleum and nuclear fuel industry. This can be explained by the substitution of energy
sources to cleaner fuels, the development of greener technologies, and improved energy
eciency. This eect suggests the importance of policies focused on encouraging emission
reductions in specic sectors that have a larger capacity to propagate the global eects
of emissions transfers. Despite the downward trend, NEU emissions multiplier (0.9)
was still signicantly higher than the OEU emissions multiplier (0.4) in the year 2007.
This dierence reects the type of fuel used in industry and the energy eciency in less
developed countries (Malik and Lan, 2016; Hoekstra et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Vale
et al., 2018)

4    Implications and Conclusions
This study set out to understand the eect of structural changes in the New European
Union countries (NEU) upon joining the EU on their CO2 emissions. We used a Structural
Decomposition Analysis (SDA) on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) from 1995

                                            14
to 2007. This analysis contributes to the debate on the environmental impact of increased
economic integration between NEU and OEU and the structural changes that have taken
place in the production structure of Eastern European countries after the end of the
Soviet Union.
    Focusing on the NEU countries, the main results show that the changes in economic
structure, driven by market reforms and new institutions that have altered trade re-
lationships, were important to explain the evolution in their CO2 emissions. Further,
the technology changes caused by the improved eciency in the use of fuels and by the
change in the production structure were responsible for reducing emissions in this club.
The change in emission-intensity was driven by the EU's climate policy, which encour-
aged reforms in the NEU club. The eect of this policy on emissions reduction was
observed mainly in the electricity, metals, chemicals, non-metallic, and rened petroleum
and nuclear fuel industries. These industries are key to mitigating the eects of CO2
emissions and can be policy targets for accelerating the adoption of measures to increase
energy eciency and substituting for cleaner energy sources. However, although the NEU
club has reduced emissions by technological improvements, this club still has low energy
eciency.
    The OEU countries, which are more ecient in terms of the use of energy sources
and less emission-intensive, maintained a high growth in total emissions driven by the
consumption of nal goods. However, this club managed to reduce emissions through
trade by transferring part of the responsibility for the total emissions to other countries.
In addition, the emissions growth embodied in exports of the OEU club was less than
the growth in emissions embodied in its imports. This decrease in emissions exports
was inuenced by the change in the trade structure between NEU and OEU, which has
increased the transfer of emissions between the two clubs. The transfer of emissions from
NEU to OEU was carried out mainly through trade of nal goods. On the other hand,
the trade of intermediate inputs drove the transfer of emissions from OEU to NEU.
    The implication of these results is that emissions' reductions associated with tech-
nology advances were not big enough to compensate for increases caused by the change
in sourcing patterns and the levels of consumption throughout the 2000s in the NEU
club. The change of sourcing patterns in the NEU club is related to the entry of foreign
direct investment in these countries, in a context of increased outsourcing through the
international fragmentation of production and greater integration with other countries of
the EU.
    These results are important for policy makers because the environmental costs in the
European Union, especially in the NEU club, is a problem that goes beyond domestic ac-
countability for emissions, given the increase in international outsourcing and the greater
integration between NEU and OEU. This result helps in measuring the eects of trade
on CO2 emissions and identifying the responsibility for these emissions. Therefore, poli-
cies to mitigate emissions, besides focusing on increasing energy eciency, should also
consider changes in the pattern of international trade.
