          The paper assesses the relationship between unemployment, industrial capacity utilization
      and in‡ation in Brazil by means of disaggregated Phillips curves. The key aspect of the analysis
      is to consider separately the dynamics of tradable and nontradable sectors, and emphasize the
      importance of employment and capacity utilization to explain disaggregated in‡ation dynamics.
      Using quarterly Brazilian data for 1999Q2-2012Q4, we estimate the NAIRU, NAICU and the
      output gap incorporating economic structure in the Kalman …lter. The results suggest that the
      unemployment gap is the relevant demand variable to explain in‡ation of nontradable goods,
      while the capacity utilization gap is important for in‡ation of tradable goods. There is evidence
      of substantial reduction in the NAIRU in recent years, and that it has been above the unem-
      ployment rate since mid-2010 – its value was close to 6.3% by the end of 2012. The results
      also suggest a dichotomy in the Brazilian economy – while the industrial sector shows poor
      performance and di¢ culties to react, the labor market is heated, generating pressures on the
      output gap. Our study also emphasizes possible biases produced by aggregate estimations in a
      dichotomous environment.

          O artigo estuda a relação entre desemprego, utilização da capacidade instalada e in‡ação no
      Brasil usando curvas de Phillips desagregadas. O principal diferencial da análise é considerar
      separadamente as dinâmicas dos setores de bens comercializáveis e de não comercializáveis, e
      ressaltar a importância do emprego e da utilização da capacidade da indústria para explicar a
      dinâmica da in‡ação desagregada. Usando dados trimestrais no período 1999Q2-2012Q4, são
      obtidas estimativas para a NAIRU, NAICU e para o hiato do produto incorporando maior es-
      trutura econômica no …ltro de Kalman. Os resultados sugerem que o hiato do desemprego é
      a variável de demanda relevante para explicar a in‡ação de não comercializáveis, enquanto
      que o hiato da capacidade instalada é a variável de interesse para explicar a in‡ação de comer-
      cializáveis. Existe evidência de substancial redução na NAIRU nos anos recentes, e que ela tem
      estado acima da taxa de desemprego desde meados de 2010 –seu valor era próximo a 6,3% no
      …nal de 2012. Os resultados também mostram uma dicotomia na economia brasileira –enquanto
      o setor industrial apresenta fraco desempenho e di…culdades de reagir, o mercado de trabalho
      encontra-se aquecido, gerando pressões sobre o hiato do produto. O trabalho também enfatiza
      possíveis vieses gerados por estimações agregadas em um ambiente dicotômico.

1       Introduction
Brazil has been experiencing an odd economic instance since 2005. Employment seems to be sky-
rocketing and almost immune to many shocks that hit the Brazilian economy during the period,
including the second great recession of 2007-2009. Over the sample, employment seems not to be
correlated at all with production or capacity utilization. Since 2010, in particular, the correlation
between employment and production seems to be negative. Indeed, capacity utilization and GDP
growth has been decreasing, whereas employment has remained in its steadily increasing path. Styl-
ized facts are shown in Section 2. On top of that, economists have been facing a hard time to …nd
a positive correlation between employment and in‡ation, which should be a trivial task in most
countries. Indeed, some economists have reported di¢ culties in estimating signi…cant coe¢ cients for
the employment gap (or unemployment) in empirical aggregate Phillips curves (e.g. Del…m Netto
(2013), Mendonca et al. (2012) and Minella et al. (2003)).
    Hence, a puzzle arises in reconciling this dichotomous behavior between employment, capacity
utilization and production, and explaining the lack of correlations between employment/production
and employment/in‡ation.
    In order to put some light into solving this puzzle, we look into disaggregate measures to …nd that
strong idiosyncrasies in two important production sectors, with opposite directions, are at play. In
particular, we explore the relation between employment, capacity utilization, output, and in‡ation
in the sector of non-traded goods, whose production is intensive in labor, and the (industrial) sector
of traded goods, whose production is intensive in capital.
    We do not seek to explain the mechanisms behind this dichotomy. We take for granted the
interpretation called "two blades of a scissor", coined by Pastore et al. (2012) and Pastore (2012).
Their analysis is based on a model with two sectors for the Brazilian economy. The explanation
for the slowdown in the industry is that labor market pressures on wages caused by the dynamism
of the service sector, coupled with the drop in productivity, increases the unit cost of labor. The
industrial sector, assumed to be nearly price taker, is unable to pass on increased costs to prices and
have reduced pro…t margins.
    We rather explore its consequences. We use an empirical semi-structural approach to model
Phillips curves1 in both sectors, and infer the non-accelerating in‡ation rate of unemployment
(NAIRU) and non-accelerating in‡ation rate of capacity utilization (NAICU) by means of Kalman
…ltering. In this dichotomous context, it is di¢ cult to de…ne what are relevant demand variables
to be used in empirical aggregate Phillips curves. Current consensus is that Phillips curves should
be total (theoretical) or partially (semi-structural) funded in micro-economic theory. One of the
strong assumptions behind most theoretical models is that all sectors are homogeneous in the use of
production factors. Under weaker assumptions, however, one cannot theoretically justify functional
forms in which only the aggregate output gap or unemployment gap a¤ects aggregate in‡ation.2
    1
     Phillips curves are re…nements of contemporary empirical relationship shown in Phillips (1958), where the change
rate of nominal wages has a negative correlation with the unemployment rate.
   2
     For the derivation of the simpli…ed functional form, in which the aggregate in‡ation rate is a¤ected by a single
gap measure, it is necessary to take several strong assumptions, e.g. in‡ation rates of all sectors have the same inertial
behavior, productivity shocks are the same in all sectors, there is no wage rigidity, and there are no frictions in the
labor market. For example, by assuming speci…c capital, Woodford (2005) shows that the Phillips curve should have
both the output gap and the investiment gap. In order to include a more realistic labor market, by embedding search


                                                            2
    Nevertheless, the popularity of theoretical models with homogeneous …rms contributed to the use
of only the output gap in most empirical exercises3 , even in Brazil (e.g. Bogdanski et al. (2000),
Alves and Muinhos (2003), Tombini and Alves (2006) and Correa and Minella (2010)).4 In Brazil, the
use of employment in empirical Phillips curves is still uncommon.5 However, considering separately
how labor and capital a¤ect in‡ation seems crucial to understanding the transmission mechanisms
of monetary policy and responses to shocks, in a context characterized by a weak performance in the
industrial sector couple with large employment rates.
    We …nd that the correlation puzzle only arises on aggregate measures. Individually looking at
both sectors, we …nd that employment is an important variable to explain in‡ation in the sector of
non-traded goods, while it is the in‡ation rate of traded goods that is highly correlated with output
and capacity utilization.
    We also …nd that the NAIRU has systematically decreased in Brazil, but not as much as the
actual unemployment rate. While the its central path was close to 11-12 % by 2002, it has decreased
to around 6.3% in late 2012. Additionally, our results also suggest that the unemployment rate has
been below the NAIRU since mid-2010. In the industrial sector , our results suggest an increase
in NAICU over the sample. By the end of 2012, it has been above the actual industrial capacity
utilization rate. We highlight, however, that our central estimates of NAIRU and NAICU carry a
high level of uncertainty, as in any empirical exercise of this nature.
    Finally, the estimated three gaps (unemployment gap, capacity utilization gap and the output
gap) highlight the role of the labor market as a source of pressure on economic activity and in‡ation,
and emphasize the dichotomy experienced by the Brazilian economy. We infer two sources of pressure
acting in opposite directions on the output gap in the last two years. On the one hand, our results
suggest that the industrial sector is more sluggish (negative capacity utilization gap) in recent years
than what a simple HP …ltering suggests, pressing the economic activity down. On the other hand,
the labor market is stronger (negative unemployment gap) than what a simple HP …ltering suggests,
pressing the economic activity up.
    In this paper, we also …nd evidence that the use of HP …ltered gaps might have contributed to
the correlation puzzle. Indeed, as di¤erent productive sectors use factors in di¤erent intensities, the
dynamics of sectorial in‡ation rates might behave very di¤erently in response to shocks. Therefore,
using a single Phillips curve to explain the aggregate in‡ation rate as a function of the aggregate
output gap, or the unemployment gap, generates speci…cation and/or omitted variable bias. More-
over, gap variables obtained by HP …ltering (Hodrick and Prescott (1997)), or other …ltering method
that does not embed economic structure, might have serious measurement error problems. And it
is a known in the econometric literature that the use of covariates with measurement error causes
attenuation bias toward zero.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents stylized facts. Section 3 presents
the empirical semi-structural model. Section 4 presents the estimation results, the estimated NAIRU
and NAICU paths, and the three estimated gaps. Section 5 concludes.


2     Stylized facts
The unemployment rate, Ut , as measured by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE), has been decreasing since mid-2003, as shown in panel (A) of Figure 1. The reduction in
frictions, the Phillps curve includes the unemployment gap in addition to the aggregate output gap (e.g. Alves (2012),
Blanchard and Gali (2010), Christiano et al. (2011), Gali (2010), Gertler et al. (2008), Gertler and Trigari (2009),
Ravenna and Walsh (2008, 2012), Thomas (2008, 2011) and Walsh (2005)).

unemployment also seems to have been almost acyclical and immune to many shocks that hit the
Brazilian economy in the period. On the other hand, the industrial capacity utilization rate, CUt ,
as measured by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI), has been quite volatile around an
almost constant average.

    Panel (B) shows that year-over-year changes in the unemployment rate remain negative in most
part of the period and almost acyclical, while GDP6 and industrial production (general industry)7
growth rates vary widely. In particular, the large decline in the Brazilian economic growth during
the 2007-2009 …nancial crisis was accompanied only by a slight increase in unemployment. There
was also no increase in unemployment in 2011-2012, when GDP and industrial production growth
have slowed down. The industrial capacity utilization rate, on the other hand, has strongly decreased
during the period.
    This evidence suggests a dichotomy in the Brazilian economy in recent years: low and declining
unemployment rates coexist with low GDP and industrial production growth rates. In fact, after
growing 7.5% in 2010, Brazil’s GDP slowed to 2.7% in 2011 and 0.9% in 2012, while industrial pro-
duction grew only 0.3% in 2011 and decreased 2.7% in 2012. On the other hand, the unemployment
rate, which was around 6.7% in the 2010 average, declined to 6.0% and 5.5% in 2011 and 2012,
respectively, and reached 4.6% in December 2012, the lowest level of the series so far.

    Panel (C) shows the di¤erent paths of traded and non-traded goods 12-month in‡ation rates.
While prices of traded goods increased 4.4% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012, prices of non-tradables rose
8.6% and 8.5%. The production of the …rst class of goods is associated with the industrial sector,
which is intensive in capital, while the latter is associated with the non-industrial sector, which is
intensive in labor. Therefore, pressures coming from the labor market are particularly important
for the nontraded goods sector, especially the service sector, where payroll represents a signi…cant
portion of total production costs.8 The sector of traded goods is more exposed to competition from
imported products, which limits their ability to adjust prices. The distinct in‡ation dynamics of
both sectors are a direct consequence of the sectoral dichotomy and suggests that it is not possible
to characterize the economy as a whole using a model with a single aggregate Phillips curve.


3       The model9
For simplicity, we assume that the in‡ation rates for traded and non-traded goods are good proxies
for the in‡ation rates of the industrial and non-industrial sectors. To avoid collinearity problems
between covariates, we only consider the most intensive production factor in each sector. Thus,
the relevant demand variable for the Phillips curve of non-traded goods is the unemployment gap
with respect to NAIRU, while the relevant demand variable for the Phillps curve of traded goods
is the capacity utilization gap with respect to NAICU. Both Phillips curves are jointly estimated
by full-information maximum likelihood, while the estimates of NAIRU and NAICU are obtained
by Kalman …ltering. We acknowledge the fact that no …ltering method is free of problems (Canova
(1998) and Canova and Ferroni (2011)). However, we assume that …lters containing greater economic
structure have more chances to extract the correct information.
    In one approach we consider in this paper we use auxiliary measures obtained by the HP …lter as
initial paths for the estimation of NAIRU and NAICU. The Kalman …lter is used to …ne-tune those
initial paths. This strategy helps the convergence of the Kalman …lter.
    We consider a dynamic linear model (DLM), in which the trajectories of the latent variables
NAIRU and NAICU are described as random walks with stochastic drifts.10 In the best speci…cation,
the model has the following form:
                             nt             fr               nt                                      0                        nt

pose verticality restrictions on the coe¢ cients of the Phillips curves. Finally, ut                log (1 Ut )
and ct log (U CIt ) are logarithmic transformations of the unemployment rate, Ut ; and the capacity
utilization rate, U CIt .
     Equation (3) deserves some comments. Note that the terms in parentheses are the explained
component of the other two equations. The sum of those values, weighted by their respective time-
varying weights, equates the explained component of the aggregate free-market in‡ation rate. If
the weights ! com t   were constant over time, this equation would not add any information to the
system. Moreover, the variance-covariance matrix of the error terms would be singular and the joint
estimation of the three equations would be impossible. It is the fact that the weights are time-varying
that allows us to jointly estimate the system.
     Now we describe the way we compute the unemployment gapm, u^t ; and the capacity utilization
gap, c^t . In this work we use two di¤erent strategies and compare their results. The …rst is to
adopt the standard approach for estimating latent variables. We will call this strategy as model MS
(standard approach). In this approach, we de…ne the unemployment gap as the di¤erence between
the unemployment rate and the NAIRU, and directly model the NAIRU as a state variable. The
same procedure is used for the capacity utilization gap and the NAICU. Thus, in model MS we
jointly estimate the system (1)-(3) with the following state variables:

   In the second approach, we use series obtained by purely statistical …lters as initial paths for the
NAIRU and NAICU. The Kalman …lter …ne tunes over those initial guesses. For simplicity, we chose
the HP …lter as the auxiliary …lter. We will call this procedure as model MA (auxiliary variables).
To see how the procedure works, we write the NAIRU and NAICU as:

stationary. Thus, it will be easier for the Kalman …lter to infer them and …ne tune the auxiliary

    Note that random walks with stochastic drift speci…cations are able to capture the vast majority
of stationary and non-stationary processes in …nite samples. Thus, the model allows the latent
variables to have stationary patterns in some parts of the sample and non-stationary patterns in
others.
    Both methods use a recursive procedure, consisting of two steps, which can improve identi…cation.
In the …rst step, we use the central values of the smoothed NAIRU and NAICU latent variables,
obtained in the previous step, to estimate the model parameters.11 In the second step, we …x the
parameters of the unemployment and capacity utilization gap obtained in the previous step, and
infer the dynamic distributions of the NAIRU and NAICU. To start the recursive process, we use
the auxiliary measurements obtained by the HP …lter. The two steps are repeated until the system
parameters satisfy a convergence criterion.


4        Estimation
We estimate the system using full-information maximum likelihood, while the estimates of NAIRU
and NAICU are obtained by Kalman …ltering. The estimation is carried outusing seasonally adjusted
quarterly data in the period 1999Q2-2012Q4. The measures of in‡ation for free prices, traded and
non-traded goods are from the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA), released by IBGE.
Time-varying weights come from the correspondents IPCA basket. We have used slightly di¤erent
measures of in‡ation rates for traded and non-traded goods, as described in Banco Central do Brasil
(2011). The method incorporates the new structure of consumption patterns, according to the
IBGE’s Household Budget Survey (POF) 2008-2009. The measure of foreign in‡ation is given by the
variation of the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index.
    The capacity utilization variable is released by CNI.12 The measure of unemployment adopted
for most of the period is the rate of open unemployment, with a reference period of 30 days from the
IBGE’s Monthly Employment Survey (PME). IBGE conducted important methodological changes
in the calculation of unemployment in 2002 to conform its measurement to international standards,
which means that this information is available only for the period from March 2002 on. To obtain
a longer data series, the unemployment data of IBGE were combined with the series of aggregate
unemployment measured by the Survey of Employment and Unemployment (PED), released by
DIEESE/Fundação SEADE-SP (from April 1999 to February 2002). This series measures the un-
employment rates in the metropolitan regions of Belo Horizonte, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre, Recife,
Salvador, São Paulo and Distrito Federal. Due to this change in the unemployment series, we also
performed an estimation using data from IBGE only, i.e., constraining the sample to 2002Q2–2012Q4.
    There are also additional variables proxying supply shocks in the Phillips curves, represented by
the vectors Xt and Zt . Several variables were tried as controls for these shocks, such as changes
in relative prices, in commodity prices, in oil prices, changes in the minimum wage etc. Of those
variables, only two were signi…cant in the equation for in‡ation of traded goods: the variable det ,
that captures the misalignment of prices at wholesale and retail (measured by the di¤erence between
the (log) Wholesale Price Index –IPA-FGV and the (log) Consumer Price Index –CPI-FGV); and
shtrt , capturing shocks to commodity prices, as measured by the CRB index (measured in Brazilian
currency) gap from its HP trend.

described above, with initial auxiliary variables for the NAIRU and NAICU obtained by HP1600
…ltering. The state variables in this model are the deviations of the initial trajectories. The estimation
results of the two models are reported in Table 1. We also present the results of the …rst step of the

    The …rst result that worth mentioning concerns the unemployment gap in the Phillips curve of
non-traded goods. Not only the coe¢ cients are very signi…cant in models MA and MS , as their
magnitudes are large ( 0:31 in both models). This result suggests that the labor market plays an
important role in in‡ation dynamics: reductions in unemployment below the NAIRU directly a¤ect
the in‡ation rate of non-traded goods and, consequently, the aggregate in‡ation rate.14
    Some economists have reported di¢ culties in obtaining signi…cant parameters for the unemploy-
ment gap when estimating aggregate Phillips curves, which could suggest a weak (or nonexistent)
relationship between in‡ation and unemployment in the short run (e.g. Mendonca et al. (2012),
Del…m Netto (2013) and Minella et al. (2003)). Our results suggest that these di¢ culties may arise
from the approach used by the authors to capture this relationship. This evidence is reinforced by
model M0 , which suggests that simply using the HP-…ltered unemployment gap, without considering
any economic structure such as the ones we impose in the Kalman …lter in this paper, seems not to
be a good strategy.15 Indeed, the coe¢ cient estimated in model M0 is much smaller ( 0:17) than
those obtained in models MA and MS and is not statistically signi…cant (P-value equal to 0:21). This
fact is a strong evidence that the HP-…ltered unemployment gap has measurement errors. It is a
well-known result in the econometric literature that an attenuation bias towards zero arises when a
regressor has measurement errors (e.g. Wooldridge (2010, cap. 4)).
    The estimated coe¢ cients for the capacity utilization gap in models MA and MS (both equal
to 0:15) are also very signi…cant, indicating that this variable plays as well an important role in
in‡ation dynamics. Note, however, that if we have considered only the HP-…ltered gap (model M0 )
the estimated coe¢ cient would be signi…cant only at the 10% level. The central estimate would be
about the same as the ones obtained in models MA and MS . This suggests that the dynamics obtained
by Kalman …ltering is more consistent with in‡ation dynamics, even though both the Kalman …lter
and HP-…ltered capacity utilization gaps have similar average volatilities.
    Regarding for the other estimated coe¢ cients in models MA and MS , most are statistically
signi…cant and have theoretically expected signs. Commodity shocks and changes in relative prices
seem to be important for in‡ation dynamics. Also worth noting are the magnitudes of the pass-
through coe¢ cients, from international to domestic prices, in the Phillips curves of traded and
non-traded goods. While the short-run coe¢ cient is estimated at around 7% for traded goods, it is
only about 2% for non-traded goods.
    Finally, the estimated coe¢ cient on in‡ation inertia of non-traded goods ( 1 = 0:36) is smaller
than that of in‡ation of traded goods ( 1 = 0:45). This is not an expected result for Brazil due

     The estimation for 2002Q2-2012Q4 is reported in Table 2 in the appendix. In general, the results are pretty

     This result complements those found in Banco Central do Brasil (2013), although in that study the impact of the
labor market on in‡ation is captured directly through wages.

     Mendonca et al. (2012) use both the unemployment gap, obtained by HP …ltering, and the actual unemployment
rate in various speci…cations of the Phillips curve. Their results suggest that, although very small, the relationship
between in‡ation and unemployment in Brazil exists in the short run.

4.1     Comparing the models
The evidence shown in the previous section suggests that HP-…ltered gaps may have measurement
errors, which generate di¢ culties in estimating the relationship between unemployment, capacity
utilization and in‡ation. Therefore, we expect model M0 to be inferior to the other two. In fact, its
log-likelihood is much smaller than the log-likelihood of models MA and MS .16 Indeed, di¤erences
   16
      A more precise analysis requires the use of marginal log-likelihoods. However, the fact that the con…dence intervals
of the coe¢ cient on the unemployment gap are much narrower in models MA and MS than in model M0 suggests that
this criterion would provide the same conclusion.

greater than log (100) = 4:60 are very large and can be interpreted as decisive evidence against model
M0 as opposed to MA or MS .17
    The di¤erence between MA and MS is more tenuous, since their log-likelihood values are quite
close. Using Kass and Raftery (1995) criterion, model MA has is a slightly advantage over MS .
Moreover, convergence of the iterative process is faster when using model MA . Therefore, we choose
this speci…cation as our benchmark model.

4.2     Non-accelerating in‡ation rates
Now we present our estimates of NAIRU and NAICU using the benchmark model MA .18 Panels (A)
and (B) of Figure 2 show the NAIRU and NAICU (smoothed series) for 2001Q1 to 2012Q4,19 the
unemployment and capacity utilization rates, and their HP-…ltered series. Panels (C) and (D) show
95% con…dence intervals (smoothed series).
    The results suggest the NAIRU has substantially decreased in Brazil over the last years. The
estimates indicate that while it was close to 11–12% at the beginning of the sample, its has decreased
to something close to 6.3% in late 2012.20 Our central estimates suggest that the unemployment rate
has been below the NAIRU since mid-2010. As in any inference of latent variables, however, our
central estimates have a high degree of uncertainty (as suggested by the con…dence interval shown
in Panel (C)) and should be interpreted with care.
    Our estimates also suggest that the actual capacity utilization rate has been well below the
NAICU in recent years, despite the fact that both the level of capacity utilization and the NAICU
have overall increasing trends in the sample. A similar remark about the uncertainty in the estimating
the NAICU (as shown in panel (D)) holds here.
    da Silva Filho (2008), using data from 1996Q2–2006Q4, …nds evidence of a constant NAIRU
(ranging at 7.4–8.5%), but highlights the fact that his estimates are quite sensitive to including
or not proxies to supply shocks in the Phillips curve. Note that our estimates are consistent with
da Silva Filho (2008) in the 2001Q1–2006Q4 period, for our central estimates show relatively little
variation given the con…dence intervals: it starts at about 11% by 2001, slightly increases to 12% in
mid-2003, and returns to about 10% in late 2006. Indeed, we can not reject the null that the NAIRU
has e¤ectively remained constant until the end of 2006. However, when considering the whole sample,
the evidence suggests that the NAIRU has signi…cantly decreased in Brazil. In a recent extension
(covering March 2002 to March 2011), da Silva Filho (2012) estimates a larger, but still constant,
level for the NAIRU (9.6%). This result, however, is di¢ cult to be reconciled with our estimates.
    There are important di¤erences between our estimated paths for the NAIRU and NAICU and
those obtained using HP …ltering. Our NAIRU estimates and the HP trend are quite similar over
2003 to 2008. Nevertheless, our beginning-of-sample estimates are smaller than HP ones (our NAIRU
estimates oscillate around 11:3%, whereas the HP trend oscillates around 12% before 2002Q4), and
the opposite happens at the sample end (our NAIRU estimates oscillate around 6:7%, whereas the
HP trend oscillates around 5:8% from 2011Q1 to 2012Q4). In the NAICU case, we also observe
important end-of-sample di¤erences. From 2011Q1 to 2012Q4, our NAICU estimates average 84:0%,
whereas the HP trend oscillates around 82:5%.




  17
     This decision rule is described in Kass and Raftery (1995) and is based on Je¤reys (1961) suggestions.
  18
     The estimates of NAIRU and NAICU using model MS , as well as an alternative estimation of model MA using the
sub-sample 2002Q2-2012Q4, are depicted in Figures 4 e 5 in the appendix. The results, however, seem no to change
much.
  19
     The model was estimated using data from the 1999Q3 to 2012Q4. However, we discard the initial values because
inferring the states in the initial periods are subject to errors of the initial distribution used by the Kalman …lter.
  20
     There are few studies with updated data on NAIRU in Brazil. The two most recent estimates are found in
da Silva Filho (2008, 2012). Older analyses are found in e.g. Portugal and Madalozzo (2000) and Lima (2003).

    There is an important message from those results. In line with recently observed larger in‡ation
rates for non-traded goods, our estimated NAIRU indicates that the labor market is tighter in recent
years than what is suggested by HP …ltering. On the other hand, also consistent with smaller in‡ation
rates for traded goods, our estimated NAICU suggests that the industrial sector has been operating
in a more sluggish way than what is suggested by HP …ltering.21

4.3     The three gaps
In this section, we describes how to retrieve an aggregate measure of output gap using our estimates
for the NAIRU and NAICU. We assume that GDP Yt is produced according to a Cobb-Douglas
technology, Yt = At (Kt Ct )1 [Lt (1 Ut )] , where At is the exogenous technology shock, Kt is
the capital stock, Ct stands for capacity utilization, Lt is the labor force, Ut is the unemployment
rate, and = 0:67, as estimated in Gomes et al. (2005). The potential output is given by Ytn =
At (Kt Ctn )1 [Lt (1 Utn )] , where Ctn is the NAICU and Utn is the NAIRU.
    Our assumptions give us a simple way to compute the (gross) output gap Yt =Ytn without relying
  21
     The di¤erences stem from the fact that our approach takes into account the interaction between the in‡ation rates
of traded and non-traded goods when estimating the NAIRU and NAICU, while HP …ltering is just a low-pass …lter
with no economic reasoning.

where y^t is the output gap, c^t is the capacity utilization gap, u^t is the unemployment gap and e^t ' u^t

    Panel (A) of Figure 3 shows the three gaps: the employment gap, the capacity utilization gap
and output gap. Panel (B) compares our estimates of the output gap with the one obtained by using
the HP …lter for extracting the GDP trend. Panels (C) and (D) compare, respectively, our estimates
of the capacity utilization and employment gaps with HP …lter gaps. Figure 3 summarizes our main
…ndings: (i) even though suggesting an economic slowdown by the end of 2012, our estimates for the
output gap clearly suggests that the Brazilian economy was better than what is implied by simply
HP-…ltering the GDP time series (Panel (B)); (ii) by the same period, our estimates suggest that
the industrial sector was more sluggish than what HP-…ltering implies (Panel (C)); and (iii), on
the other hand, we …nd evidence that the labor market was more heated than what predicted by
HP-…ltering (Panel (D)).

   Both measures of output gap display similar dynamics throughout the sample, as shown in Panel
(B). However, the HP-…lter gap has more pronounced movements, especially after 2007. From the
world economic crisis of 2007/2008 on, the HP gap measure became extremely volatile, whereas our
measure remained with the same volatility level as before the crisis.


5    Conclusions
Brazil has been experiencing an odd economic instance in recent years. In the aggregate, economists
have been facing a hard time to …nd a positive correlation between employment and in‡ation, which
should be a trivial task in most countries. Hence, a puzzle arises in understanding the lack of such
correlation.
    In order to solve this puzzle, we have looked into disaggregate measures. In particular, we have
explored the dichotomy in the Brazilian economy: Brazil has been characterized by low and decreasing
unemployment rates along the last decade, on the one hand, and low capacity utilization and GDP
growth rates, on the other hand. Simultaneously, the in‡ation rate in the sector of non-traded goods
has been persistently high in recent years, up to 2012, while the in‡ation rate in the sector of traded
goods has been much lower.
    In this context, we have tested a semi-structural empirical model to study the relationship between
unemployment, capacity utilization and in‡ation in Brazil. The key feature of the model is that it
has two separate Phillips curves, for the in‡ation rate of traded and non-traded goods, which are
jointly estimated by full maximum likelihood method. In the sector of traded goods, we assume
that production is much more intensive in capital, whereas it is intensive in labor in the sector of
non-traded goods.
    Therefore, we assume that the Phillips curves for the sectors of traded and non-traded goods have
the capacity utilization gap and the unemployment gap as appropriate demand variables, respectively.
We use the Kalman …lter to infer the non-accelerating in‡ation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)
and non-accelerating in‡ation rate of capacity utilization (NAICU), by means of adding economic
structure in inference. Using a simple production function, we combine those results to obtain three
gaps: unemployment gap, capacity utilization gap and output gap.
    Our results suggest that the labor market does have a signi…cant impact on the dynamics of
in‡ation, especially through the non-traded goods sector. The impact of capacity utilization, through
in‡ation of traded goods, is also relevant. We argue that the evidence of a weak relationship between
unemployment and in‡ation in Brazil, reported by many economists, may be due to: (i) standard
analyses using aggregate quantities, which disregard the idiosyncrasies of di¤erent sectors; and (ii)
measurement errors in the variable used as the unemployment gap, obtained by a naive HP-…ltering,
which cause attenuation biases during inference.
    We …nd that the industry is more sluggish than what HP-…ltered capacity utilization gaps suggest,
whereas the labor market is tighter than what HP-…ltered unemployment gaps predict.
    Finally, our results emphasize the dichotomy experienced by Brazilian economy. They suggest
that the NAIRU has substantially reduced in Brazil in recent years, but not as much as the actual
unemployment rate has. Our results also indicate that since mid-2010 the labor market has been
operating at full-employment and pushing up the in‡ation rate of non-traded goods. The estimated
NAICU path con…rms that the industrial sector has been slowing down, and that has been keeping
the in‡ation rate of traded goods at bay.
