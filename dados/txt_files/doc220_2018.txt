           This paper evaluates the opportunities equalizing process in Brazil over the last
       20 years. Using the theoretical framework from Benabou and Ok (2001), we try to
       answer the following questions: (1) Was there an mobility process in Brazil for almost
       40 years, from 1976-81 to 2014, equalizer of opportunities? (2) If it was, when was this
       mobility process stronger, from 1976-81 to 1996, or from 1994-99 to 2014? Combining
       this methodology with a educational level persistence through generations approach,
       our results show that this period was marked by a opportunities equalizing process,
       that got stronger in its second half. This paper helps to get a better understanding of
       the last decades of Brazil regarding the development of a fair society.

1    Introduction
The entry in the 2000s marks a favorable period for Latin America countries and Brazil.
In addition to economic growth, increased exports and reduced external vulnerability, the
country is recognized internationally for its success in fighting poverty in this period. The
good performance was made possible by a combination of elements that have long been
overlooked: high rates of household per capita income growth and continuous reduction
of income inequality. Both indicators improved more rapidly since 2004, and began to
show signs of stagnation from 2013. In fact, from 2014 the economic and political crisis
intensified, and since then Brazil lives a period of severe instability.
    However, a recent study of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel-
opment points out that in Brazil the socioeconomic status of the parents still plays an
important role in their descendents’ position in society. In fact, the persistence of socioe-
conomic status is still very high between generations, indicating a low intergenerational
mobility in Brazil. The study estimates that it would be necessary nine generations for a
child born in a low-income family to reach the average income level.
    The intergenerational mobility is an indicator that expresses the inequality of opportu-
nities, because it associates the chances of an individual reaching a certain social position
from the socioeconomic position of their parents. Intergenerational educational and income
mobility in Latin America is low compared to developed countries, revealing mechanisms
of greater persistence of inequalities and problems of social justice.
    One of the most important mechanism to reduce inequality of opportunities is the
access and quality of education. During this period there was an increase in the average
schooling of the Brazilian population, from 6 years of study in 2001 to 7.8 in 2014 for
people over 25 years of age. Several programs were implemented to increase the access of
the less favored population to tertiary education (FIES, PROUNI, quotas) and even to
technical education (PRONATEC).
    Mahlmeister et al. (2017) used data from the social mobility supplements of PNADs
1996 and 2014 to compare the intergenerational mobility of education in Brazil. The au-
thors show, through an analysis among age cohorts, a decrease in the intergenerational
persistence of schooling over time. However, they found a trend towards an increase in ed-
ucational persistence at the upper end of this distribution, and a reduction in the bottom.
    This article aims to analyze the evolution of the intergenerational mobility of education
in Brazil using the equalizer approach proposed by Benabou and Ok (2001), in which the
notion of mobility is associated with equal opportunities. For the intergenerational case,
we adapt the ideia of the authors identifying the opportunities as expected schooling of the
descendents from the mobility process and the parents’ schooling. In general, a mobility
process is defined as an equalizer (or progressive) if, for any initial distribution of schooling,
the distribution of expected schooling is more egalitarian. From this approach, the evolution
of intergenerational mobility as an equalizer process will be analyzed comparing 1996 and
2014.
    Our main results show that, following this theoretical framework, there was a oppor-
tunities equalizing mobility process between 1976 and 2014. Also, we see that this process
was stronger in the second half of the period, from 1994-98 to 2014, than in the first,
from 1976-81 to 1996. The difference between both periods was strong and statistically
significant.
    The article is structure as follows: in the section 2, we make a bibliographical review
on equality of opportunities and social mobility in Brazil, focusing mainly on the measure
of persistence of educational level through generations. Then, in the 3 we present the the-
oretical framework used by Benabou and Ok (2001) to identify and compare opportunities
equalizing mobility process, showing how we adapt it for Brazil. Next, in section 4 we
detail how we use this theoretical framework to empirically analyze the period in question.

2    Social Mobility and Inequality in Brazil
Equality of opportunity is a popular concept of fairness, in which one’s social position would
be all endogenous to individuals. This concept is mainly linked to intergenerational social
mobility, that is, how much outcomes from sons are not due to their previous family social
position. So, in Latin America, including, Brazil, educational persistence trough generations
has been a very popular measure of (in)equality of opportunities in the literature.
     According to Ferreira and Veloso (2003), cross-generational educational mobility in
Brazil is based on data from the 1996 PNAD supplement, which is lower than in all
developed and developing countries except Colombia. Still, mobility varies between regions
and race, being greater in the South and Southeast and for the white population than in
the North and Northeast and for the black population. Furthermore, with the exception
of children with parents at the top of the distribution of years of study, there is a greater
intergenerational persistence of education for children of parents with low schooling.
     The results of Ferreira and Veloso (2003) are in line with Behrman et al. (2001), which
shows a correlation between parents’ education and the considerably higher education
of children in four Latin American countries, including Brazil, in relation to the United
States, in addition to the fact that Brazilians have among them the highest correlation,
even compared to Colombia, with a slightly lower intergenerational transmission coefficient
of education.
     In Brazil, according to Barros and Mendonça (1997), the intergenerational associa-
tion of schooling is greater than the same in relation to income, which shows that the
mechanisms of transmission from parent to child of education were stronger than those of
income. With more updated data, Gonçalves and Neto (2013) investigate if there was a
greater intergenerational mobility of education in the Metropolitan Region of Recife, with
microdata made available on the subject by the Nabuco Foundation (Fundaj), finding a
considerable reduction in educational persistence between the generations between 1996
and 2010, indicating that the strong schooling of the population played a leading role in
this process of almost 15 years.
     Torche (2011) finds significant results for the role of education in increasing social mo-
bility in the United States, where it finds a low intergenerational transmission of schooling
between parents with a university degree and their respective children. Such intergenera-
tional persistence of education, however, grows as much for fewer years of parenting as for
more, forming an intergenerational U-education curve.
     After four centuries of educational exclusion among the poorest of the population,
Brazil has gone through the last 20 years of rapid expansion of basic and university school
attendance. In the 1980s about 25 percent of children 7-14 were out of school, and almost
50 percent of 15-17 year olds were in the same situation. However, from the end of the first
half of the 1990s these rates accelerate rapidly, until, as early as 2001, these percentages
fell to around 2 and 15 percent, respectively.
     Governmental educational policies in the first decades of the year 2000 were marked by
inclusion programs in Higher Education (FIES, PROUNI, and quotas), as well as a greater
effort for training and professional qualification with technical education. So, not only did
the country witness a great educational inclusion at its basic level, but also the access to
Higher Education with a strong expansion of vacancies in universities, mainly fomented
in the second half of the 1990s, with the increase in the number of private universities,
following the approval of the Basic Education Directives Law of 1996 and Decree no 2.207
, in 1997, both in order to create a regulation for private higher education, in relation to
the quality of courses offered according to Traina-Chacon and Calderón (2015).

    Mahlmeister et al. (2017) used data from the social mobility supplements of PNADs
1996 and 2014 to compare the intergenerational mobility of education in Brazil. The de-
gree of intergenerational persistence of education in Brazil in 2014 is 0.49, lower than in
1996 (0.68). However, the mobility pattern is not linear with the level of parental school-
ing. Dividing the sample according to parents’ education, the authors show a coefficient
of persistence of 0.95 for children of parents with three years or less of schooling, and 0.38
for children of parents with more than three years of schooling. Moreover, the result of a
regression of the son’s education into a two-order polynomial in the father’s education con-
firms the evidence of non-linearity in the transmission of educational inequality between
generations, since the quadratic term is negative and significant, denoting that the per-
sistence is lower for children of parents with higher schooling. Finally, they found a trend
towards an increase in educational persistence at the upper end of this distribution, and a
reduction in the bottom.
    Our analysis contributes to this literature applying the idea of Benabou and Ok (2001)
of income intergerantional mobility as an equalizer process. In this way, a process of mo-
bility is perfectly equalizer of opportunities when the sons have the same expected income,
regardless of the incomes of the parents. In this case, although the income performed by
the son may present inequality, such variations would be due only to unanticipated shocks.
In general, a mobility process is defined as an equalizer (or progressive) if, for any initial
distribution of income, the distribution of expected incomes is more egalitarian. Pero and
Szerman (2008) show that the intergerational income mobility process in Brazil reduces
the Gini coefficient of "initial" incomes from .60 to .40 of the expected incomes. This re-
sult means that 66.6 percent of the observed inequality in 1996 between the 1957-1966
cohort was due to inequalities inherited from the previous generation. In other words, the
inequality of opportunities contributes to about 65 percent of the income inequality in
Brazil.
    This article combines the intergenerational mobility of education approach for Brazil
with Benabou and Ok (2001) theoretical framework to identify and compare an equalizer
opportunities process from two main recent periods of 15-20 years each, as we will expose
in the next section.


3    Theoretical Framework
Any variable distribution (usually income) may be identified by a cumulative distribution
function (cdf) F : R+ ⇒ [0, 1], with mean µF . Let’s denote as F(X) the class of any variable
distribution. The generalized inverse of a distribution F ∈ F (X) is defined as

                     F −1 (p) ≡ inf {y ∈ X : F (y) >= p},     0≤p≤1                       (1)
    which corresponds to the variable value of the person whose rank in the distribution is
p. The Lorenz curve associated with F can be defined as the graph of the function:
                                       Z p
                        LF (p) ≡ 1/µF      F −1 (q)dq, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1                       (2)
                                          0
    When LF (p) is the proportion of the total (or mean) amount of the variable rela-
tive to the less resourceful p of individuals. An F distribution Lorenz-dominates another
distribution G when

                                LF (p) ≥ LG (p) ∀p ∈ [0, 1]                               (3)
    Which is denoted as F %L G.



                                              4
    A mobility process on X, denoted M(X), is a function M : R+ × X → [0, 1] such that
M (.|y) ∈ F (X) ∀y ∈ X. Thus, M(x|y) is the probability that an individual with any
variable value y today will have x tomorrow. This process must be continuous and strictly
monotone.
    Let a society be defined as the triplet (X, F, M) consisting of a set of any variable X,
an initial distribution F ∈ F (X) and a mobility process M ∈ M (X). Benabou and Ok
(2001) denote opportunities as the expected incomes in t relative to income y in t-1. We
will, otherwise, denote it as the expected schooling of the son in t relative to schooling of
the father in t-1.
    The main reason why we use schooling rather than income is due to lack of data in
Household . However, we do not find this adaptation limiting, since education has a very
well documented positive effect on wages in Brazil. OECD shows, for example, that relative
earnings of workers with college degree is 150% above average upper secondary education
job wages, while Griffin and Edwards (1993) estimates from a mincerian equation the rate
of return to an additional year of schooling between 12.8 and 15.1% and Stefani 2006,
looking at heterogeneities in labor returns of education, shows that one more year of study
might have been responsible for a rise of 28% on wages in 1996.
    There are two primary channels by which education can impact labor income. The first
one is by raising productivity via human capital accumulation (see Becker (1994)). Not
only does human capital lower cost of information acquisition (see Rosenzweig (1995)), but
also as workers acquire skills, experience and knowledge, a wider array of what they can
produce, and how efficiently, becomes available.
    The second is through signaling (see Spence (1978)). The idea is that, due to labor
markets’ asymmetric information, high school diplomas, college degrees and other forms
of education certificates act as signals. As they’re costly to acquire, these credible pieces
of information make employers more willing to hire workers with more, better signals and
also to do so for higher wages.
    Let eM (y) be the conditional expectation of schooling from a intergenerational process,
its distribution induced by (X, F, M) is then given by the cdf

                            λF,M (x) = F (e−1
                                           M (x)) ∀x ∈ eM (X)                              (4)
    with support eM (X).
    Now, the case when there is perfect equality of opportunities when the expected school-
ing conditional to fathers’ education inequality is zero. So, it is possible to generalize this
intuition stating that a mobility process in a society is equalizer in opportunities when
it leads to a ex-ante educational prospects that are more evenly distributed than initial
schooling endowment, no matter how unevenly distributed it was. Formally, that can be
written as

                                  λF,M %L F       ∀F ∈ F (X)                               (5)
    Now, to compare different mobility processes, it is possible to declare a process M to be
more equalizing than N if the expected schooling of individuals with parents’ in different
social positions are more equally distributed under M than under N, no matter the parents’
social position distribution. More formally, one can declare M %eq N if

                                λF,M %L λF,N       ∀F ∈ F (X)                              (6)
    So, summarizing, a intergenerational mobility process M can be declared equalizer if,
for any initial inequality, the expected sons’ schooling are more evenly distributed than the
parents’ schooling, and it can be declared more equalizing than another process N if, again
for any initial inequality, it generates a more evenly expected sons’ schooling distribution
(or if the expected sons’ schooling distribution in M Lorenz-dominates the one in N).

                                              5
4       Methodology and data
According to the theoretical framework exposed above, the variables of interest to evalu-
ate the intergenerational mobility process is the schooling of the father and the expected
schooling of the son. We then present our econometric model:

                                   SCi = β0 + β1 SF i + β2 Zi + i                                   (7)
    Where SC i is the schooling of the individual i, SF i is his father schooling, Zi are
dummy controls highly associated with both previous variables and that should have zero
coefficient in a context of equality of opportunities1 . The, our variable eM (X) is defined
as presented:

                                   eM (X) = β0 + β1 SF i + β2 Zi                                     (8)
    Where we subtract from (7) the error term i .
    This paper uses data from the Brazilian National Sample Household Survey (PNAD),
a cross-section of nearly 350,000 individuals conducted yearly from the mid 70s to 2015 by
the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). PNAD has data on numerous
characteristics of the population, such as labor, income and education. Almost every year,
PNAD has additional questions regarding a specific topic, called a Thematic Supplement.
In 1996 and 2014, it had additional data about socio-occupational characteristics of the
population at least 16 years old and their families, but when aged 15 years old.
    One information this supplements brings is the parents’ schooling, that is reported
by his son. This way, it is possible to get the coefficients from a General Least Squares
(GLS) method and then have the expected schooling from two mobility process (M1996
and M2014 ), and two fathers’ schooling distribution (F1996 and F2014 ).
    However, the variable that represents the level of schooling of the father has the draw-
back of being categorical. Because of that, we follow Ferreira and Veloso (2003) to assign
the numerical values of years of schooling for the different parental education categories.
The father’s schooling assumes value 0 if the son reports that the father has less than 1
year of study; 2, whether he completed the first, second or third grade of elementary school,
but did not complete the fourth; 4 if he completed the fourth grade; 6, if he completed
the fifth, sixth or seventh grade, but did not complete the eighth; 8, if he has completed
eighth grade; 10, if he has incomplete secondary education; 11, if he has completed high
school; 13, if you have completed but not completed tertiary education; 16, if he has a
college degree.
    An important difference between PNAD from 1996 and 2014 is that, while the first
one asks the fathers’ schooling only to the responsible for the household and his/her hus-
band/wife, in the last one, the question was answered by any one randomly selected in the
household. This way, in order the make the two datasets comparable, we will use only these
two first categories of role in the household. Also, we will restrict our sample to men from
30 and 35 years old, to get a age cohort that will allow us to compare similar historical
times. With this restrictions, we are comparing a mobility process from the years 1976-81
to 1996 and 1994-99 to 2014. Also, since 1996 PNAD does not have individuals from rural
cities in the North Region (except for the ones in Tocantins State), we will have to exclude
them in the 2014 edition.
    Finally, we will restrict our sample only to men between 30 and 35 that lives in the
municipality he was born. That way, the location dummies on our econometric model will
be valid to the location the individuals were born, escaping from some endogeneity. This
    1
   This variables are attributed to individual’s race and location, including the region, and whether his
municipality was in a Metropolitan Region and whether it was a rural city

way, in our sample from 1996 we will have almost 4,700 individuals that, when weighted,
represent almost 2,300,000 individuals from the total population. Our 2014 sample, on the
other way, have little more than 1,000 individuals that, when weighted, represent little
more than 570,000 from the total population.
    Table 1, shows some descriptive statistics about our samples. In any year, we are
considering a very urbanized population, concentrated in Southeast and Northeast regions.
In 1996 sample, the mean schooling of the sons were slightly lower than 7 years of schooling,
while fathers’ was only almost 3. Also, fathers’ schooling was vastly unevenly distributed,
while sons’ schooling was somewhat more equal. In 2014 sample, the mean schooling rose
for both fathers and sons, but only the distribution of the last one got really more equalized,
while the first one was just a little more even.

    We will not be able to compare the two mobility process from any fathers’ schooling
distribution, but it will be possible to simulate the M1996 and M2014 for two different
distributions F, from 1976-81 and 1994-99. This way, we will declare a mobility process
to be more equalizing than other if it generates a more evenly distributed expected sons’
schooling in both fathers’ schooling distribution.


5    Results
Table 2 shows the coefficients from our robust regressions for expected sons’ schooling.
As it’s possible to see, there is a higher (but decreasing) correlation between fathers’ and
sons’ formal education in 1996 than in 2014: while in the first dataset, we show a positive
coefficient of 0.92 from the linear term and a negative coefficient of -0.03 of the quadratic
term, the same ones were 0.05 and 0.013 for the 2014 sample. Also, in this last one, the
coefficient estimated for the linear term was not statistically significant.

    The results are summarized in Table 5. As we can see, whether with F1996 or F2014 , 20
years latter expected son’s schooling Gini is 0.11 with M2014 , while with process M1996 , it
varies between 0.24 or 0.25. Also, Graphs 3 and 4 shows that, for both fathers’ schooling
distribution, M2014 process Lorenz-dominates M1996 . Finally, both expected sons’ schooling
are more evenly distributed then fathers’.

    According to our Theoretical Framework, exposed in section 3, both M1996 and M2014
processes were opportunities equalizers, once their expected sons’ schooling distribution
generated were more equal than fathers’ schooling, for any point of its distribution - mean-
ing that λF,M Lorenz-dominates F, as Figures 1 to 4 show.
    Also, since λF,M2014 Lorenz-dominates λF,M1996 , we can say that the mobility process
from 1994-99 to 2014 was more opportunities equalizer than from 1976-81 to 1996. The dif-
ference between both Lorenz Curves were higher than zero for any point between extremes,
even for a 95% confidence interval, both from 1976-81 and 1994-99 fathers’ schooling dis-
tribution.

6    Conclusions
In this paper, we developed an analysis of almost 40 years of a intergenerational mobility
process split in two: 1976-81 to 1996 and 1994-99 to 2014. Exposing a theoretical framework
from Benabou and Ok (2001), we adapt its methodological procedure to match available
data in Brazil, exchanging income for schooling as metric - what we argue not to be limiting,
since education has a very well documented strong and positive effect on wages in Brazil.
     Following this approach and combining it with the , equality of opportunities is stronger
when expected sons’ schooling distribution Lorenz-dominates the parents’ observed. Also,
a mobility process may be considered as more opportunities equalizer than other when the
first one’s expected sons’ schooling Lorenz-dominates the last. Strictly, it must holds for
any parents’ observed schooling, but we test it only for both periods compared: 1976-81 to
1996 (M1996 ) and 1994-99 to 2014 (M2014 ).
     In order to calculate expected sons’ schooling, we use PNAD’s supplement data for
socio occupational characteristics of the population at least 16 years old and their families,
but when aged 15 years old. We make use of a General Least Squares econometric model
for generate coefficients for parents’ schooling effect on sons’, adding controls also related
to opportunities equality, such as sex, race and place of birth. We restricted our sample to
men and their fathers, for those who live in the cities where they were born, in order to
reduce our biases.
     Our results have shown that, for this period of almost 40 years in Brazil, opportuni-
ties were equalized, with expected sons’ schooling inequality getting lower than parents’
observed educational level. Also, it’s shown that, for both parents’ education distribution
(from either 1976-81 or 1994-99), the mobility process from the second period generated a
more evenly distributed sons’ expected schooling. Considering, then, that M2014 expected
sons’ education distribution Lorenz-dominates M1996 ’s, it’s proved that the latter period
was more opportunities equalizer than the first.
