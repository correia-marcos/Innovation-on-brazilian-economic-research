Abstract

The Programa de Sustentação do Investimento (BNDES PSI) was structured by the
Brazilian Government at 2009, with the explicit aim of stopping the aggregate investment
plummet, observed at the first semester of that year. With an expressive budget, this
program has recently received much attention in the Brazilian economic debate, with
several authors questioning its capacity to burst investments, since the GFCF has not
recovered its pre-crisis level. Using information available at the firm level, this paper aims
to contribute to the debate by evaluating the impact of PSI on the investment level of firms
– focusing in the industrial sector. The identification strategy adopted for this purpose was
based on two complementary matching estimators: the Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
and the Conditional Differences-in-Differences Matching (DIDM). The data used came
from the Industrial Survey (PIA) of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE) on economic activities of Industrial firms for the 2007-2010 period and from the
BNDES’ records on Industrial firms receiving PSI financing in the 2009-2010 period. The
empirical results showed a positive impact of PSI on the firms’ investment level, even
though its magnitude declined in between 2009 and 2010.

Introduction

Since July 2009, PSI has offered financial incentives to the acquisition of capital goods,
with conditions that vary, among other factors, according to aggregate investment trends in
the Brazilian economy. In general, the PSI can be understood as a reduction in the final
price of domestic capital goods (price of the goods added to the financing cost), which
represents an incentive for Brazilian companies to allocate more resources for investment.
Due to its large-scale allocation budget and its rather low interest rate on financing, the PSI
has come under question in relation to its capacity to influence investment in the country,
within a context in which the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) of the Brazilian
economy has not recovered to the levels recorded before the financing crisis. Therefore, it
seems natural that current Brazilian economic debate should focus on the cost-benefit ratio
of the program.
Due to the classic problem of selection that hampers the impact evaluation of public
policies, widely discussed in Heckman et al (1997, 1998), it is not a simple task to identify
to what extent the PSI stimulus has effectively been converted into investment. To evaluate
PSI effects on industrial companies’ investments, widely used matching estimators, such as
Propensity Score Matching and Conditional Difference-in-Difference Matching, were
applied. Such methods allowed the comparison of companies receiving PSI support with
those that did not. The database used in this evaluation were: i) the IBGE’s Industrial
Survey (PIA) from 2007 to 2010; and ii) information on financing offered within the scope
of the BNDES PSI (1st phase) from 2009 to 2010.
Results show a positive and significant impact of the PSI on the level of investment in the
companies in 2009 and 2010. That is, in the absence of the program, the Brazilian industrial
segment would have invested less. However, we observed a reduction of the estimated
effect at 2010, when compared with 2009. This robust result was achieved through several
specifications of the applied methods, based on a progressive control of the selection bias.
The paper is structured in five sections, besides this introduction. The Program section
contextualizes and describes the PSI in its first phase. The Strategy Identification section
presents the econometric approach used to estimate the impact of the program. In the
Database section, the sources of researched information are presented, as well as the
descriptive statistics of the basis used. The results of the estimated models are presented in
the Results section and the Final Considerations section discusses the main findings and
implications of the results found.
The Program

To understand the goals of PSI, it is necessary to assess the context for its creation.
Between the 3Q08 and the 1Q09, the GFCF fell approximately 20% in nominal terms3,
after the international financial crisis reached the Brazilian economy. In late June 2009,
after a timid recovery, investment remained at a much lower level than that recorded
immediately prior to the crisis.

It was in this scenario that the BNDES’ PSI was launched, in July 2009. With an initial
allocation budget of R$ 40.1 billion, the program consisted fundamentally of a change to
the then-existing financing conditions for BNDES Finame, targeted at stimulate the
acquisition and production of capital goods manufactured in Brazil. The goal was to
employ more favorable financing conditions to reverse the investment decline that had
occurred.
Table 1 summarizes the financing conditions for operations using the BNDES PSI between
July 2009 and June 2010, a period in which Phase 1 of the program remained in effect. For
comparison, it is worth recalling that BNDES Finame’s traditional financing conditions for
machinery and equipment established a financial cost comprising the long-term interest rate
(TJLP - then at 6.25% p.a.), a spread for the BNDES of 0.9 % p.a., and a spread negotiated
directly between the end customer and the financial agent of the operation.

In practice, this new set of conditions meant a substantial reduction in the interest rate for
financing to purchase machinery and equipment, while eliminating, for the buyer, the
uncertainty regarding the final financial cost of the operation by introducing a fixed interest
rate.
Chart 2 compares the distribution of the final average interest rates for operations in the PSI
(Phase 1) and BNDES Finame, while Chart 3 makes the same comparison of the
distribution of the total term of the loan. It is possible to note that the final interest rate
median dropped from approximately 10% p.a. in Finame loans to 4.5% p.a. in PSI . It is
also possible to note that the distribution of loan terms is denser in PSI loans with more
than 100 months than in Finame loans with the same loan term.
That is, BNDES PSI, from a theoretical point of view, can be understood as a reduction in
the final price of capital goods (price of the good plus the cost of financing), which should
work as an incentive for Brazilian companies to allocate more resources for investment.
Therefore, the program’s incentive mechanisms were operating at a microeconomic level,
regardless of their motivation stemming from the macroeconomic context of the Brazilian
economy.

Chart 4 suggests that the Brazilian companies considered that program’s most
advantageous financial conditions were attractive, given the increase of the demand for
BNDES’ disbursements. However, the question this paper tries to face is: to what extent
was this additional demand for funds from the BNDES effectively associated with a change
in investment decisions of Brazilian companies?
The behavior noted in the aggregate investment level (Chart 1) does not support an
appropriate answer to this question. After all, there are several factors affecting the
behavior of the Brazilian GFCF, such as the exchange rate, business expectations, changes
to regulation etc. It is not reasonable to evaluate the results of PSI based solely at the
behavior of macroeconomic series - which consolidate not only the impact of PSI, but a set
of other economic variables.
It is at the microeconomic level that BNDES PSI should be assessed. This means adopting
an empirical strategy that enables the identification of whether there is a causality
relationship between PSI incentives and the reaction of companies’ investments, which
would represent a breakthrough in discussions on the impact of the program.

Identification strategy

While discussing methods for public policy evaluations, Heckman et al (1998, p.264)
concluded that the main difficulty arises fundamentally from a lack of information,

                                                                                                   5
originating from the impossibility of observing a single agent in two different
circumstances – treated and non-treated. In the words of the authors:
                   “Each person can be in one of two possible states, 0 and 1, with associated
                   outcomes (Y0, , corresponding to receiving no treatment or treatment
                   respectively. (…) Let D=1 if a person is treated; D=0 otherwise. The gain from
                   treatment is ∆ = Y1 - Y0. We do not know ∆ for anyone because we observe only
                   Y=DY1 + 1-D Y0, i.e. either Y0 or Y1.”

That is, it is not possible to compare the evolution of a company receiving PSI support with
progress that the firm itself would have had with no access to the program. Any technique
that aims to estimate the impact of PSI on investment decision needs to extract this
information by comparing a group that had access to the program with another group of
companies, containing only firms with no access. Besides, the access to PSI is the result of
a process in which two important events take place: i) based on their innate characteristics,
firms choose to seek or not financing within the program; ii) commercial banks4, in their
turn, select companies to which they grant credit, based on an analysis of credit risk and in
compliance with the program’s legal and regulatory requirements.

These two selection processes tend to produce a sample in which the differences between
the groups of companies are correlated, at the same time, with the expected policy outcome
and the probability of access to the policy instrument. Thus, there is a clear problem of bias
in selection.

To deal with this problem, this study used a traditional method at the evaluation literature:
the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) originally proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983,
1984). This method basically increases the degree of comparability between the treated and
non-treated groups, ensuring that they comprise similar firms with regard to this propensity
score, i.e. the probability of taking part in a program that is conditional to the important
features for access (productivity, size, profitability, etc.). The basic assumption in this
method is that if companies are "equal" in terms of this probability, then the difference
noted in investment can be considered a result of the program.5

Formally, consider a set of characteristics and one variable that defines the status of
participation of a particular firm in PSI, assuming a value of 1 for participants and 0 for
other firms. It is then possible to estimate the propensity score                    1| ,
which represents the probability that a given firm i will take part in PSI at t, given its
characteristics in t-1, before accessing the program.

By initially assuming that this probability depends solely on the characteristics of
companies that are observable, the first stage of the PSM method is to obtain ̂   an

  PSI operates by means of indirect operations, in which commercial banks are responsible for the credit risk
analysis.
5
  The use of propensity score for matching was motivated by the work by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983,
1984), which demonstrated the validity of the balancing property in the propensity score. The validity of this
property implies that if the propensity score is known, it is possible to use it as a substitute for the set of
variables that condition participation when matching.

                                                                                                             6
estimator of         1| , which can be obtained by estimating a parametric model such as
a logit or probit (more details in Blundell and Dias, 2009).

Having obtained ̂    for the sample of companies used6, the second step is to estimate the
Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATT).7 This estimator is formally defined in [1]
below:
                                            ∑∈                ∑   ∈         [1]


      is the measure of impact of PSI on current investments of treated companies ( ).
Moreover, T and C represent the treatment groups and control, respectively,       is the
weight placed on the observation of comparison ! for the company " (calculated using the
estimated propensity score) and      is the re-consideration that recovers the outcome
                                 8
variable for the treated sample.

Following Blundell and Dias (2009), two identification hypotheses are essential to ensure
the consistency of the estimates in this method: first, it is assumed that there is
independence, conditional to the propensity score, between the results of the untreated
firms # and the status of treatment. This hypothesis can be formally defined as [2]:
                                                 #
                                                     $    |       "   [2]
Moreover, it is necessary to satisfy the common support assumption, formally defined in
[3] below. It is intuitive to note that if a particular group is associated with ̂    1,
then there will be only treated companies with these characteristics and, therefore, you
cannot obtain a group of firms that is comparable and has not used PSI resources.

                                             %           1| & ' 1 [3]
The main limitation to this estimation method, however, is that it deals solely with the
selection bias related to observable variables. For this reason, this paper employed a second
identification strategy, initially proposed by Heckman et al (1997), which combines the
method of Difference-in-Differences (DID), widely used in the evaluation literature, with
the PSM (referred to as the Conditional Difference-in-Differences Matching - DIDM
hereinafter). The DIDM can be understood as a variation of PSM, which may be applied
when there is longitudinal data available for treated and controls groups.



6
  Implementing the method requires specification of the estimated model of the propensity score to satisfy the
balancing property of the sample. This verification is based on a test t of average differences between groups
receiving support and those not receiving support, for each of the co-varieties in the model, the sampling
strata defined based on the distribution of ̂     . For details, see Becker and Ichino (2002).
7
  The term treated comes from the initial application of this technique, which aimed to identify the effect of
medical treatments by comparing the performance of treated patients (called the treatment group) with that of
the untreated group (called the control group). In our case, access to PSI resources can be considered a kind of
"treatment".
8
  The literature uses different methods to calculate these weights based on individual estimated probabilities
of participation in the program. Notable techniques include "Nearest Neighbour", Kernel and Stratification.

                                                                                                              7
Intuitively, this estimator compares the evolution of the results of treated companies with
untreated firms throughout the observation period (before and after treatment) and
attributes any difference in evolution to the impact of the treatment. This identification
strategy is quite interesting for evaluate PSI, since literature has shown it is capable of deal
with selection bias, caused by unobservable variables (provided they are time invariant).

Formally, the identification hypothesis the method assumes is that, conditional to the
observable factors , development of the unobservable part # between the periods before
and after the treatment is independent from the status of treatment:
                                   ()            ( ,)+      $       )|       [4]
Additionally, it is necessary to impose the common support hypothesis, as in the case of
PSM estimator. The version of the common support hypothesis for DIDM, however,
requires all treated firms to have a counterpart in the non-treated population observed
before and after treatment. Formally:
                                        %   ",         1| , ,& ' 1 [5]
Based on those assumptions, the ATT parameter for accessing PSI estimated by DIDM, in
the region of common support of in the sample, is formally defined as:

                    -.-
                            ∑∈ %    )            ,)+    &   ∑   ∈        %    )    ,)+   &   [6]
In which notation is similar to that used previously. It is expected that this method is able to
better control a possible selection bias associated with program participation when
compared to the PSM, as Heckman et al, 1997 have demonstrated.

Database

In order to apply the methods described in the previous section it was necessary to
construct a database that, on the one hand, listed the companies that have accessed the
program and, on the other, consolidated a set of economic characteristics for a large group
of firms, a requirement for determining comparable groups of non-treated.

A list of companies who used the program was obtained through a consolidated database
from the BNDES’ operational records, consolidating information for all releases associated
with the acquisition of machinery and equipment carried out under PSI-Phase 1. Companies
receiving PSI support totaled 18,624 in 2009 and 36,761 in 2010. Although PSI finances
firms from various sectors of the economy, this evaluation focused on the industrial sector.
Considering only this segment, the number of firms financed by PSI reached 4,271 in 2009
and 10,317 in 2010, as shown in Table 2.

Table 3 shows the total PSI disbursement to financed companies per group size and sector.
The main information to note in this table is the total amount disbursed in loans to the
industrial sector, which reached approximately R$ 1.7 billion in 2009 and approximately
R$ 8.6 billion in 2010, totaling just over R$ 10 billion in disbursements during the first
phase of the program.

                                                                                                   8
To obtain reliable economic characteristics on program users, this study chose to use the
Industrial Survey (PIA Enterprise) of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE), which is the most important source of micro-data from Brazilian Industrial Sector.
In this study, we took into consideration data from this Survey for the years 2007 – 20109
and worked solely with firms surveyed in Right Stratum10, because there are more detailed
economic and financial information, required to implement the identification strategy
adopted.

After merging BNDES and PIA databases, we constructed a dummy (called psi) that took a
value of 1 when observation had received any amount of PSI resources, and zero
otherwise11. Then, exploratory analysis and information validation were conducted, in order
to identify outliers and observations with insufficient or inconsistent information. An
important decision taken while consolidating the database was to exclude all observations
with declared investment equal to zero.

This choice represents an undeniable bias towards increasing the average investment in the
control group and, therefore, a bias towards underestimating the effect of the program –
which stands against the tested hypothesis. Moreover, as the PSI is an investment financing
program, one could argue that companies that have chosen not to invest would be, by
definition, ineligible for the program and, therefore, would not serve as a comparison
group. Again, that choice increases homogeneity between control and treatment groups.

Finally, companies that had very low or very high investment rates were considered
outliers12. The intention was to exclude companies that reported a volume of investment
incompatible with declared revenue, in order to reduce informational errors that might
distort results.

Clearly, the methodological choices above reduced the number of observations available.
Still, the final base was a robust selection of information, comprising more than 15,000
industrial companies in each reference year. Of this total, approximately 1,500 received
resources from PSI in 2009 and, in 2010, that number rose to approximately 3,700
companies. Tables 4 and 5 aim to show the characteristics of groups of firms financed in
comparison with the group of non-financed companies for each year in which the impact of
PSI was estimated. The goal is to compare these groups in terms of the variables used in the
estimated models before participating in the program to identify the degree of pre-existing
heterogeneity among them. Despite the fact that constructing the database favored
homogeneity, the group of financed companies still shows characteristics that are
substantially different from the other group – emphasizing the difficulties involved at this
exercise. In such cases, the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators tend to produce
inconsistent estimates of the average impact of the program.

Results

Table 6 shows the impact estimates of PSI on the current investment level of the industrial
companies and compares the results for each method used for the 2009-2010 periods.
Besides PSM and DIDM estimates13, it also shows basic OLS estimates to discuss the
selection bias problem. The first point to note is that all results presented in Table 6 indicate
that PSI had a positive and statistically significant impact on the industrial companies’
investment level. This is certainly the main conclusion produced by this work.14

As expected, the OLS estimate appears to have a positive bias, with a tendency to
overestimate the impact of the program. It is possible to see that the coefficients estimated
using this method - respectively 0.96 and 0.95 for 2009 and 2010 - are substantially higher
than those estimated using DIDM - 0.34 and 0.24. The coefficients estimated using PSM, in
their turn, were closer to those made by OLS. This may indicate that most of the existing
selection bias derives from unobservable variables.15

It should be noticed that the average impact of PSI was higher in 2009 than in 2010. This
was found in all proposed estimates, but was particularly strong in the DIDM specification
– precisely the better method to control the problem of selection bias. In this model, the
coefficient falls from 0.34 to 0.24 from one year to next.

Table 7 approaches the magnitude of the PSI impact on the companies’ investment level.
Firstly, it shows the average investment in the sample for companies that used the program
- which reached approximately R$ 1.2 million in the two reference years (column A).
Column B uses the DIDM coefficients to estimate the counterfactual investment level for

    Propensity Score of the company estimated by Logit. The annex to this study presents more detailed
estimated-selection equations and the respective set of conditional variables used in this first estimation step
for each year. It is worth noting that all specifications satisfied the balancing properties, which is evidence
that the selection model is well specified. For details on implementing the PSM, see Becker and Ichino (2002)
and Leuven and Sianesi (2003), and DIDM, see Villa (2011).
14
   It is important to point out that several specifications were tested, with changes in the explained variable, in
the definition of the sample and in the matching method. Altogether, some 28 estimations were carried out,
and in 26 the result was a positive and statistically significant impact. Tables 12 and 13 in the Annex offer the
results of all tested specifications.
15
   In the case of the OLS estimation, the same relation of variables used in the final selection equations for the
PSM and the DIDM was used as covariates. In this case, the coefficient associated with the dummy psi was
used to model the effect of access to PSI in the investment decision of companies. Again, further details of
this specification can be found in the Annex.

each year in the analysis. It follows that, in 2009, the program's impact reached
approximately R$ 352,000 per supported firm, considering that average firm. This number
represents an increase of 40% compared to what would have occurred in the absence of
PSI. Looking at 2010, this number fell to R$ 272,000 – representing an increase of 28%
(values shown in column C).16

The decrease in the average impact of PSI was accompanied by a rise in the program’s
average disbursements for the period, which reached R$ 465,000 in 2010 - against R$
298,000 a year earlier (column D in Table 7). These two combined movements generated a
strong fall at the Effect per Disbursement ratio (column E in Table 7). Thus, on average,
every R$ 1 of PSI disbursement generated an impact of R$ 1.18 on company’s investment
in 2009. In the next year, the same R$ 1 disbursed were associated with only R$ 0.58 of
investments that would not have occurred without that financing.

Therefore, in 2009, PSI was able to affect the investment decision to the extent it induced
the inclusion of other capital sources. However, in 2010, it is possible to observe some
degree of substitution, with PSI disbursements taking the place of other capital sources.
That dynamic suggests that PSI potential effect decreased during the analyzed period.
Three possible causes for this behavior were considered.

The first possible explanation relies on the credit constraint problem, which was
particularly severe in 2009 when the financial crisis was acute. Therefore, it is natural that
the program was more important to release investment decisions of Brazilian industrial
firms in that year. The macroeconomic context was very different in 2010, when the
Brazilian economy seemed to be operating under normal conditions.

A second possible explanation is the existence of a negative relationship between the
marginal effect of the policy (created investment) and the treatment dose (amount of
disbursements). If treatment dose matters, the reducing policy effectiveness might be, at


16
  Assuming that industrial companies financed by PSI outside our sample are similar to those that have been
used – a strong assumption – it is possible to obtain the total investment added by PSI on the Brazilian
industrial sector. Using the average impact calculated at Table 7, we reach approximately R$ 2 billion in
2009, when 4,271 companies used about R$ 1.7 billion in releases from the program. In 2010, that number
would amount to approximately R$ 5 billion, associated with 10,317 companies financed with approximately
R$ 8.6 billion in disbursements.

                                                                                                                   13
least in part, a consequence of an increase of PSI resources share inside company’s total
investment.

Such explanation is consistent with a theoretical model in which each firm has a limit to its
potential investment expansion. In this scenario, when a company’s total investment is
below this potential level, the policy would encourage the firm to expand its investments,
but only up to a certain point. When this limit is reached, additional doses of the treatment
would merely replace financing sources in the firms’ capital structure, rather than
promoting the expansion of its investment level.

Hence it is possible to suppose the existence of an efficient point for the participation of
PSI resources in company’s total investment. Beyond that point, additional resources would
be marginally less efficient in creating investment. One possible implication of this view is
that the effectiveness of the program could be increased simply by reallocating PSI
resources among firms - reducing PSI’s share in the capital structure of companies that
received more than would be optimal, and increasing the share for those that received less.

The third explanation is based on the intertemporal aspect of the investment decision. In
this case, companies would simply take advantage of the more attractive PSI’s financing
conditions to realize in the current period investments that, otherwise, would have occurred
in the future. In a nutshell, at least part of the PSI positive effect might be associated with
anticipation rather than investment creation. If the long term companies’ investment is not
affected by PSI, then the anticipating behavior has a limit.

Final Considerations

Within a context in which GFCF did not recover the pre-crisis level, recent Brazilian
economic debate has questioned PSI’s capacity to influence aggregate investment in the
economy. This study aimed to find evidence about the impacts of PSI using methods that
could correctly address the selection bias problem. The main conclusion is the program had
a positive impact on the investment level of industrial firms for the 2009-2010 periods.

However, the decreasing estimated effect during the analyzed period has raised a number of
questions, which still need to be investigated. It is known that the program has been
extended since it was created, with financial incentives that have varied according to the
behavior of investment in the economy. Hence it is essential to investigate whether this
public policy is still capable of affecting investments of financed companies.

In order to do so, the future research agenda intends to evaluate each of the possible causes
of the decreasing additionality of the program. Besides, it is relevant to address possible
indirect effects of the program on different outcomes, such as employment and
productivity.
