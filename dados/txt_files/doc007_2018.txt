Abstract. The paper investigates the role played by Friedman’s interpretation of the
Brazilian inflation in his 1967 formulation of the natural rate hypothesis and in his
1976 discussion of indexing and other institutional arrangements in the face of
chronic inflation. It is argued that, as an empirical economist and in the absence of
evidence from industrialized countries, Friedman found in the Brazilian 1964-66
stabilization episode significant support for his argument about inflation acceleration
and a shifting Phillips curve. Friedman’s interest in the Brazilian inflationary
economy prompted him to visit the country in 1973. The context and implications of
Friedman’s Brazilian travel are also tackled in the paper, for the first time in the
literature.

Resumo. O artigo investiga o papel que a interpretação de Friedman da inflação
brasileira teve na formulação de sua hipótese sobre a taxa natural em 1967 e no seu
tratamento em 1976 da indexação e outros arranjos institucionais face à inflação
crônica. É argumentado que, como economista empírico e na ausência de evidência
vinda de países industrializados, Friedman encontrou no episódio de estabilização
brasileiro em 1964-66 suporte significativo para seu argumento sobre aceleração da
inflação e instabilidade da curva de Phillips. O interesse de Friedman pela economia
inflacionária brasileira o levou a visitar o país em 1973. O contexto e implicações da
viagem brasileira de Friedman são também tratados no artigo, pela primeira vez na

1. Some crucial monetary episodes from Brazil

As has been often pointed out, the criticism put forward by Milton Friedman (1968)
and Edmund Phelps (1967, 1968) of the stability of the Phillips curve was mainly
theoretical, not empirical (see Nelson 2017, pp. 228-29, and references there cited).
Friedman (1977, p. 455) acknowledged as much in his Nobel Memorial Lecture.
Phelps and Friedman were not aiming to elucidate a riddle posed by empirical
evidence. Estimates of the relation between the rate of change in nominal wages (or
prices) and unemployment performed relatively well in the 1960s, largely duplicating
the nonlinear inverse “successful” (Phelps 1968, p. 680) fitting of British historical
data by A. W. Phillips (1958). Indeed, a main purpose of Friedman and Phelps was to
“reconcile” the empirical Phillips curve with the theoretical “neutrality axiom of
anticipated inflation”, as put by Phelps (1968, p. 682). They did that by postulating
that the Phillips curve shifts upwards (downwards) with the expected rate of increase
(decrease) of prices (or wages), accompanied by convergence of actual
unemployment to its “natural” or equilibrium level.
         However, Friedman (1968, pp. 8-9) did use a piece of empirical evidence in
support of his hypothesis about the role of inflation expectations in determining the
position of the (short-run) Phillips curve. He referred to the 1964-66 Brazilian
stabilization plan and its perverse effect on employment due to persistent anticipations
of inflation. Friedman’s (1968) discussion of inflation and unemployment in Brazil is
restricted to just one paragraph. But it is a crucial one, as that is also the only
paragraph in his 1967 Presidential Address in which Friedman discussed Phillips
(1958) and charged him for failing to distinguish between nominal and real wages.
The impact of inflation expectations on Brazilian money wages provided a forceful
illustration of the instability of the Phillips curve, he claimed. Friedman (1966, p. 59)
had referred to the Brazilian episode as “the most dramatic example” of the “fallacy”
that there is a lasting trade-off between inflation and employment. In the first draft of
his 1967 Address, Friedman (1967a, p. 22) wrote that, for relatively low inflation
rates as in the US and the UK at the time, it was easy to interpret the time series as “a
trade-off between price-rise and unemployment rather than between acceleration of
price-rise and unemployment”. Hence, “to distinguish between these, one must look
at a broader range of experience. The difference is then patent.” It is implicit that the
monetary history of countries beset by chronic high inflation, like Brazil and other
South American nations, should be able to provide the required evidence.
         Friedman was primarily an empirical economist who used general economic
principles to scrutinize facts in order to make predictions. As argued by Hirsch and de
Marchi (1990), a close reading Friedman’s (1953) methodological essay in the
context of his economics indicates that he was much closer to the pragmatism of John
Dewey than to the falsificationism of Karl Popper. Instead of the Popperian separation
between the contexts of discovery and justification of hypotheses, Friedman was
concerned with the process of inquiry. From that perspective, theories follow as
results of acquaintance with facts, in the sense that empirical investigation is
prominent not just in assessing a theory but also in developing it. The empirical basis
of theories comes from working back from fact observations to assumptions. He
found much inspiration for his economic methodology in Alfred Marshall and Wesley
C. Mitchell (see also Backhouse 1996, chapter 11; Hoover 1988, chapter 9.2).
         Friedman’s work as a monetary economist was dominated by his study about
money and business cycle (with Anna Schwartz) for the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER). The highpoint of that project – started in the late 1940s
                                                                                     3


and continued for more than three decades, until the early 1980s – was their 1963
Monetary History (see Hirsch and de Marchi 1990, chapter 10; Hammond 1996). That
book epitomized Friedman’s methodology, with its stress on historical episodes and
rejection of conclusive statistical tests to choose among alternative hypotheses.
Friedman’s case for the role of money as a prime determinant of economic
fluctuations was built on the investigation of selected crucial episodes, such as the
contraction of money supply in the US Great Depression in the early 1930s,
mentioned in his 1967 Address (Friedman 1968, p. 3). Economic history and
economic theory are, therefore, intertwined in Friedman’s economics. As put by
Hirsch and de Marchi (1990, p. 244), the methodological position that came out of
Friedman’s work as a monetary economist was that a “rich appreciation of what is to
be explained is crucial … dramatic and discriminating tests have almost no place; the
marshaling of evidence to strengthen conviction is almost everything”. That is
consistent with Friedman’s 1953 argument that a fruitful hypothesis is
        A way of looking at or interpreting or organizing the evidence that will reveal
        superficially disconnected and diverse phenomena to be manifestations of a
        more fundamental and relatively simple structure. (Friedman 1953, p. 33)

        Friedman’s 1967 Presidential Address has been seen as an exception to the
primacy of empirical evidence in his monetary economics. Backhouse (2007, p. 17),
for instance, has mentioned the “irony” that Friedman’s point about the accelerationist
Phillips curve arose out of purely theoretical arguments with no empirical ground. It
was only in the 1970s, with the recorded co-existence of rising inflation and
unemployment – as well as some evidence of a vertical long-run Phillips curve – in
industrialized countries, that Friedman’s natural rate hypothesis gained assent (see
also Forder and Sømme 2018). As discussed below, the Brazilian monetary
experiment, as seen by Friedman, represented a “crucial episode” that provided a
forceful illustration of what was to be explained.
        Friedman was probably briefed about Brazil by other Chicago economists
with knowledge of South American economies, particularly Arnold Harberger and
Larry Sjaastad, who were frequent visitors to the region since the 1950s (see
Harberger 1997). Friedman (1977, p. 464) would refer to Harberger (1966) and
Staajstad (1974) as sources about chronic inflation in South America. Harberger took
part in the 1963 Rio conference about inflation and growth in Latin America, a major
event sponsored by the Economic Growth Center of Yale University (Baer and
Kerstenetzky 1964; see Harberger 1964, partly based on his better known 1963 essay
about Chile). Indeed, as suggested by Robert Gordon,
        I have always thought that the development of the natural rate hypothesis in
        Chicago, rather than at Harvard or MIT, reflected the deep involvement of
        several Chicago economists as advisers to several countries in Latin America,
        where the lack of correlation between inflation and unemployment was
        obvious. (Gordon 2011, p. 16)1


1As for Phelps, an indirect South American connection cannot be assumed away, as
he was worked at the Cowles Foundation, Yale University, from 1960 to 1966, which
housed as well the Economic Growth Center, one of the foremost centers for the study
of economic development. Werner Baer was the economist in charge of the Latin
American agenda of the Growth Center, including the organization of the 1963 Rio
conference.

Gordon, however, did not relate that to Friedman’s (1966, 1968) remarks about
Brazilian inflation.
        In December 1973 Milton Friedman and his wife Rose spent a week in Brazil,
where he gave lectures and met businessmen and members of the government. Except
for a few days in Caracas in September 1969, to attend the Mont Pèlerin Society
regional meetings, it was his first time in South America. Friedman’s Brazilian trip,
briefly recounted in Friedman and Friedman (1998, p. 426) and discussed here in
some detail for the first time, is not as well known and certainly not as controversial
as his visit to Chile in March 1975. Like Chile, Brazil was a military dictatorship at
the time. However, unlike the Chilean case, Friedman and the Chicago School had not
played a key role as advisors or in training economic policy makers in Brazil.2 Upon
his return to the US, Friedman (1974a) wrote enthusiastically about the so-called
“Brazilian economic miracle” in his Newsweek column. In his view, the widespread
indexation of economic contracts, the first of its kind in monetary history, was a main
factor behind the successful stabilization of the Brazilian economy. By preventing the
negative output effects of differences between actual and anticipated inflation,
indexation contributed to the very high rates of economic growth achieved by Brazil
between 1967 and 1973, he claimed. Friedman (1974a; 1974b) went as far as
proposing that indexation should be introduced in the American economy as well.
Although Friedman (1977) did not refer to Brazil, the notion, advanced in that lecture,
of a short-run vertical Phillips curve under fully indexed economic contracts, as well
as the discussion of indexation as part of institutional arrangements to cope with
inflation persistency and volatility, may be seen as a reflection of his Brazilian trip.3


2. Brazilian inflationary expectations

In September 1958 Friedman attended the ninth meetings of the Mont Pèlerin Society,
held at Princeton (New Jersey). The topic of the conference, attended also by some
economists from developing countries, was inflation. Eugenio Gudin – the dean of
Brazilian economics and Minister of Finance for a short period (September 1954 to
April 1955) – gave a talk about the Brazilian experience with chronic inflation, and
the political opposition he faced when attempting to bring it down through restrictive
monetary policy. That was Friedman’s first encounter with Brazilian inflation. Gudin
reacted to Friedman’s (1958, p. 3) passing remark that steady inflations tended to
accelerate.


2 Instead of the Chilean “Chicago Boys”, Brazilian graduate economic students in the
1960s and 1970s may be described as the “Vanderbilt Boys”, as the modernization of
economics in the country was heavily influenced by a cooperation agreement between
Vanderbilt University and the University of São Paulo, led by Werner Baer after he
left Yale for Vanderbilt (Suprinyak and Fernández 2018). Some Brazilian economic
students did go to Chicago for their PhDs at the time, though. That included Carlos
Geraldo Langoni, who finished his PhD in 1970 and, together with Harberger,
accompanied Friedman to Chile in 1975. On that occasion, Langoni lectured about
Brazil as a showcase of economic policies supposedly consistent with the Chicago
free market credo (Edwards and Montes 2018; Foxley 1980).
3 See Boianovsky (2018b) on the role of economists’ traveling in the formulation of

new economic hypotheses throughout the history of thought.
                                                                                       5


       Prof. Friedman’s point that it is almost impossible to keep an inflationary
       process within bounds … is not confirmed by Brazilian experience, where
       inflation has been and still is running at an average annual rate of 20% for
       almost ten years. The principle that “a small inflation is like a small
       pregnancy” has not proved true in the Brazilian case. (Gudin, 1958)

However, Brazilian inflation did accelerate in the early 1960s, as its average annual
rate increased from 18% and 28% in 1950-55 and 1955-60 respectively to 62% in
1960-65 (Boianovsky 2012).
         Friedman ([1963] 1968, p. 49) would write about Brazilian inflation for the
first time in his lectures delivered in Bombay (India). He then distinguished between
the relatively mild effects (such as the tax on cash balances) of steady anticipated
inflation – as in the case of Israeli 10% average inflation in 1952-62 – and intermittent
inflation that proceeds by fits and starts, as in Brazil. Because of long lags in the
adjustment of expectations, changes in the rate of inflation (or its turning into
deflation) tend to bring about unemployment and misallocation of resources. “One of
the clearest examples of this kind of process”, asserted Friedman (ibid) “occurred
some years ago in Brazil”. He probably had in mind Gudin’s stabilization experiment
of 1954-55, although his description also fits the 1958-59 stabilization plan carried
out by Lucas Lopes and Roberto Campos (see Skidmore 1967, pp. 159-60 and 175-
76).
         First Brazil experienced a very rapid inflation. Then the Government made a
         heroic attempt to stop prices from rising by curtailing the printing of money.
         Initially wages and prices continued to rise for a time and Brazil experienced
         continued moderate inflation together with a large volume of unemployment.
         (Friedman [1963] 1968, p. 49)

In an economy with expectations adjusted to past inflation, as was the case of Brazil
in the 1950s and 1960s, a sudden interruption of the growth of money supply will
cause unemployment, argued Friedman, since wages and prices tend to continue to
rise for a time. If the central bank persisted in its tight monetary policy, agents would
change their price expectations, and extra unemployment would be eliminated.
However, as illustrated by the Brazilian episode, the central bank generally reacts to
the (temporary) effects of monetary stabilization on inflation and unemployment by
resuming the previous trend in money supply. The outcome is a stop-and-go process
accompanied by waste of resources. “People’s expectations of rising prices are
justified. A ratchet process is set in train by successive abortive attempts to curb
inflation” (ibid).
         Friedman (1966) came back to Brazilian inflation in a key passage of his
critical comment on Solow (1966).4 With the partial exception of a brief mention in
Friedman (1962, p. 284), it was his first ever discussion of the Phillips curve and of
the trade-off between inflation and employment. Friedman (1966) attacked the view,
ascribed to Solow (1966) and others, that lower unemployment levels could be
reached through pressure on aggregate demand and higher inflation rates. From that
perspective, the adoption of guideposts etc. was a way to achieve higher employment

4 Friedman (1966) may be read as an implicit reaction to Samuelson and Solow
(1960) as well, which he did not mention on that occasion or before. On the reasons
for Friedman’s delayed reaction to that well-known article see Nelson (2017, chapters
7 and 13).
                                                                                        6


and suppress the symptoms of inflation, which Friedman found fallacious. The correct
argument, he claimed, was “rather sophisticated”. In order to make his case, Friedman
referred again to Brazilian recent monetary history; this time he focused on the
stabilization plan carried out in 1964-66 by Roberto Campos after the 1964 military
coup d’état.5 Unlike previous plans discussed by Friedman ([1963] 1968), it was
relatively successful, even if with significant unemployment costs. Apart from
information from Harberger and other Chicago economists with South American
links, Friedman may have benefitted from Alexandre Kafka’s (1967) paper, which
probably circulated in Chicago the year before. Friedman stated that
        To suggest to you briefly why I say [Solow’s argument] is a fallacy, I ask you
        to consider the experience of some countries that have gone much further
        along this line than we have. The most dramatic example I know of is Brazil,
        which, two or three years ago … was having price inflation of about 90% a
        year. Through “tight” monetary policies, they cut the rate of inflation down to
        about 45% a year … Unemployment rose to 15% at least for a time. Now, by
        Bob [Solow’s] logic you would say that this a trade-off between inflation and
        unemployment, that the Phillips curve in Brazil is such that in order to
        maintain an acceptable level of unemployment, you would have to have price
        inflation of 90 percent a year. I think almost everybody would agree that that
        is an absurd statement. And so it is. (Friedman 1966, p. 59)6

        That was followed by Friedman’s (ibid) oft cited phrase that “What is true is
that you have a trade-off between unemployment today and unemployment
tomorrow”. The Brazilian experience indicated that there is no long-run “stable trade-
off between inflation and unemployment” (p. 60). Friedman’s argument was not
based on statistical tests or empirical estimates of the Phillips curve for Brazil (or for
other South American countries with similarly high inflation rates), which did not
exist at the time, but on the interpretation of a particular monetary episode. Spurred
by Friedman’s (1966, 1967) discussion of Brazilian inflation, A.C. Lemgruber (1974)
estimated, under Bennett McCallum’s supervision, the first Phillips curve for the
Brazilian economy. It was also one of the first econometric exercises for any country
indicating a vertical long-run Phillips curve. Lemgruber’s findings have been
controversial among Brazilian economists, though, as discussed further in the next
section. What the Brazilian 1964-66 episode indicated, according to Friedman, was
that, because of inflationary expectations, unemployment could only be kept at
relatively low levels if inflation accelerated.
        Go back to the Brazilian case. They could have maintained unemployment
        low by going from 90% to 100% to 125% to 150% inflation. After a time, they
        would have gotten to the point where even acceleration of inflation would not
        keep unemployment low. When they cut it down to 45%, they of course got
        temporary unemployment. But … as inflationary expectations are broken, you
        will come back to a higher level of employment. (Friedman 1966, p. 59)

5 For a Chicago perspective on Campos’s role in the economic reforms introduced in
Brazil at the time, see Harberger (1993).
6 Friedman’s numbers for the rate of inflation are not off the mark (cf. Kafka 1967).

However, the source of his figure for the rate of unemployment is puzzling, as there
was no unemployment data for Brazil at the time. In any event, historians agree that
the level of economic activity came down significantly in 1964-66 (see e.g. Fishlow
1973).
                                                                                          7



Friedman (ibid) forecasted that “it’s the same way in the United States”. Although
there were no similar episodes of high inflation in the US, Friedman generalized the
Brazilian case by arguing that monetary expansion could only produce lower
unemployment “temporarily”, before agents adjusted their expectations.
         Shortly after his comment on Solow, Friedman (1967b), while working on the
first draft of his Presidential Address, once again used the Brazilian 1964-66
stabilization episode to bring out his thesis that the notion of a trade-off between
inflation and employment, as suggested by the Phillips curve, was based on analytical
confusion between nominal and real wages. “An extreme and illustrative example of
that was offered by Brazil a few years back” (Friedman 1967b, p. 40). “What Brazil
illustrates”, he argued, “is that what matters is not the level of inflation, but whether it
is higher or lower than before” (ibid).
         The first draft of Friedman’s 1967 Address, dated July 1967, was titled “Can
full employment be a criterion of monetary policy?” Indeed, the preliminary program
of the 1967 meetings of the American Economic Association in Washington D.C,
published in the September 1967 issue of the American Economic Review, announced
that as the title of Friedman’s Presidential Address. Apart from the title, there are
other significant changes between the July draft and the final version (see Forder 2018
for some of those differences). The passage in Friedman (1968, pp. 8-9) about Brazil
and the Phillips curve is identical with the July draft (Friedman, 1967a, p. 13, section
2 on “analysis”). Towards the end of the draft, in section 3 called “implications”,
Friedman (1967a, pp. 21-22) discussed the possible objection that it may take a long
time for inflation expectations to develop. He suggested that the “time scale” in the
US was “rather slow”, measured in periods of 4 or 5 years. That contributed to the
difficulty to distinguish empirically between inflation and its acceleration. A “broader
range of experience” was needed to provide evidence that the relevant trade-off was
between inflation acceleration and unemployment. Giving Friedman’s reference to
Brazil earlier in the draft, the “broader experience” should be found in highly
inflationary economies. Indeed, Friedman (1968, p. 11) referred to the supposedly
established fact that adjustment of expectations to inflation is much faster in South
American countries, with their “more sizable changes”, than in the United States.
         The passage about Brazil in Friedman’s (1968) Address follows immediately
his charge that Phillips (1958) implicitly assumed that employees and employers
anticipated stable nominal prices, whatever happened to prices and wages. That
assumption was patently wrong in the case of inflationary economies like Brazil, he
claimed.
         Suppose, by contrast, that everyone anticipates that prices will rise at a rate of
         more than 75 per cent a year – as for example Brazilians did a few years ago.
         Then wages must rise at that rate simply to keep real wages unchanged. An
         excess supply of labor will be reflected in a less rapid rise in nominal wages
         than in anticipated prices, not in an absolute decline in wages. (Friedman
         1968, pp. 8-9)

After stressing the influence of inflation anticipation on the determination of money
wages, Friedman discussed its implications for the evolution of unemployment in
Brazil during the 1964-66 stabilization plan, along the lines of his 1966 comment on
Solow.
        When Brazil embarked on a policy to bring down the rate of price rise, and
        succeeded in bringing the price rise down to 45 per cent a year, there was a
                                                                                     8


       sharp initial rise in unemployment because, under the influence of earlier
       anticipations, wages kept rising at a pace that was higher than the new rate of
       price rise, though lower than earlier. This is the result experienced, and to be
       expected, of all attempts to reduce the rate of inflation below that widely
       anticipated. (Friedman 1968, p. 9)

The Brazilian episode, Friedman argued, illustrated not just the notion of the
instability of the Phillips curve, but also, because of the lagged adjustment of
expectations, of the overshooting often involved in stabilization policies.7


3. Visiting Brazil and praising indexation

Friedman’s 1973 visit to Brazil, a few years after his Presidential Address, had been
originally scheduled for December 1972, but was postponed due to a heart surgery
(Friedman and Friedman 1998, p. 426). By 1973, the Brazilian rate of inflation had
fallen to about 15%, and the average rate of economic growth for the period 1967-73
had reached nearly 10%, after the central bank stopped its tight monetary policy in
1967. Friedman’s (1974a) travel report compared Brazilian intense growth at the time
to other “economic miracles” in post-war Germany and Japan. He was impressed by
the introduction of widespread purchasing-power escalator clauses into contracts in
the financial, labor, housing and exchange rate markets, as well as in taxation rules.
Brazilians called it “correção monetária” (“monetary correction”), a term Friedman
(1974b) deployed as the title of his best-known paper on the topic. Price stability was
obviously better, but “theory and practice coincide in demonstrating that a true second
best” for living with inflation is the widespread use of escalator clauses. Alfred
Marshall had advanced the theoretical argument for indexation in 1887. The Brazilian
experience, Friedman (1974a) suggested, “parallels Marshall’s proposal with amazing
fidelity – by the force of necessity, not design”. Drawing on his 1967 remarks about
the costs of Brazilian stabilization, Friedman claimed that
        Given the inevitable, if temporary, costs of reducing inflation rapidly without
        such a measure, the Brazilians have been extremely wise to adopt it. I believe
        that their miracle would have been impossible without the monetary
        correction. With it, they have been able to reduce inflation gradually from
        about 30 per cent in 1967 to about 15 per cent now, without inhibiting rapid
        growth. (Friedman 1974a)

        Apart from his Newsweek article, Friedman’s impressions of his Brazilian tour
may be found in an interview given on 4 January 1974 to William Clark, a reporter of
the Chicago Tribune (Friedman 1974c). Some practical details may be inferred from
his correspondence with Eudoro Villela, who sponsored Friedman’s trip. Villela was a
Brazilian entrepreneur, president of Banco Itaú (one of the largest Brazilian banks)
and of “Associação Nacional de Programação Econômica e Social” (ANPES;
National Association for Economic and Social Programming), a think tank created in
1964 by Roberto Campos. Friedman arrived in São Paulo on 15 December 1973 and
returned to the US a week after. During his stay, he delivered a talk about economic
policy on 17 December in São Paulo at ANPES. He also lectured on monetary theory

inflation acceleration (Boianovsky 2018a).

at a university in the same city, and toured Brasilia and Rio. In a letter of 1 August
1973 to Villela, Friedman (1973a) expressed his wish to make real his “proposed trip”
to Brazil, canceled the year before. In another letter, Friedman (1973b) discussed his
travel plans and wrote that he and Rose were “looking forward to the experience”.
        Friedman came to Brazil to learn about the performance of the Brazilian
economy and its widespread indexation. Dissemination of Chicago ideas was
secondary to that goal. As he said at the beginning of the Chicago Tribune travelogue
interview, “I was much more interested in what I saw in Brazil then what I said in
Brazil!” (Friedman 1974c) By 1968, monetary correction had been extended to
virtually every market (see Fishlow 1974). Friedman was “fascinated” by the
seemingly ability of Brazilian policy makers after 1967 to fight inflation without
increasing unemployment. In his view, indexation set the groundwork for the so-
called Brazilian “economic miracle”. Unlike Friedman’s (1966, 1968) description of
the 1964-66 stabilization episode, when expectations were slow to adjust, the
reduction of the rate of inflation between 1967 and 1973 was not accompanied by
recession, but the opposite. This happened because, due to escalator clauses, “they
have eliminated the effect of the difference between the rate of inflation that people
expected and the rate of inflation you actually have” (Friedman 1974c).
        Friedman’s discussion of Brazilian indexation and his campaign for a similar
application to the American economy raised critical reactions (see e.g. Fishlow 1974).
Two international conferences on indexation were held in São Paulo (1975) and Rio
(1981), published in 1977 and 1983 respectively, with papers about the Israeli
indexation record as well (see Nadiri and Pastore 1977; Dornbusch and Simonsen
1983). By then, models of wage indexation by Jo Anna Gray (1976; based on her
1975 Chicago PhD thesis, cited by Friedman 1977, who was on her thesis committee)
and Stanley Fischer (1977) had become influential. Simonsen (1983) showed, in an
extended version of the Gray-Fischer model, that, in the absence of supply shocks,
full widespread indexation relieves the output loss of anti-inflationary policies, as
price expectations are eliminated from contracts. Full-wage indexation turns the short-
term Phillips curve into a vertical line, as argued by Friedman (1974b, 1977) in his
papers and implied in his 1974c interview. However, the type of indexed wage
contract found in Brazil was based on a staggered rule, with money wages adjusted at
time intervals according to previous inflation rate. As modeled by Simonsen (op. cit.),
lagged wage indexation, under the assumption of rational expectations, leads to a
Phillips relation analogous to the one with adaptive expectations.
        There was yet another important difference between Friedman’s indexation
system and Brazilian actual experience, as observed by Morley (1977, p. 85).
Friedman had in mind ex-post adjustment for past inflation. However Brazilian wage
laws introduced in 1965 ruled that wage increases were granted to restore the average
purchasing power over a previous period (24 months) and to offset prospective
increases in productivity and prices. Mario Henrique Simonsen (1983, p. 119), who
devised the original wage formula, later described it as a “rational expectation
staggered wage determination rule” instead of an indexation scheme. It acted as an
incomes policy instrument, since the Brazilian government decided the expected rate
of inflation and the productivity gain, with no room for collective bargaining or
strikes under the military regime. In practice, the wage formula squeezed real wages
between 1965 and 1967, when future inflation rates were underestimated.8 This is

8The average real wage rate in the industrial sector dropped 25 per cent between 1964
and 1967 (Simonsen, ibid). Kafka (1967), however, produced some qualitative
                                                                                       10


distinct from Friedman’s (1966, 1968) account of Brazilian 1964-66 recession as the
outcome of an increase in real wages due to slow adjustment of workers’ price
expectations.
         Indeed, the application of Phillips curve analysis to the Brazilian labor market,
first carried out by Lemgruber (1973, 1974), would be challenged by some Brazilian
economists on the grounds that mandatory wage setting rules were effective in
determining the pace of wage changes, instead of cyclical excess demand for labor
(see Bacha and Lopes 1983). Skepticism was also founded on the notion that Brazil,
like other Latin American countries, was a dual economy with perfectly elastic labor
supply à la Lewis (Nugent and Glezakos 1982). Fishlow (1973, p. 77) acknowledged
the relevance of price expectations in explaining the Brazilian recession of 1964-66,
but claimed that it operated in ways distinct from the expectations-augmented Phillips
curve approach. That was similar to Morley (1971), who argued that the relation
found by Friedman and Schwartz (1963) between changes in money supply and
output applied to Brazil, via the effect of credit scarcity on aggregate supply instead
of aggregate demand though.
         Friedman was, of course, aware of the Brazilian political situation and its
effects on trade unions and other aspects of economic and social life. Asked by the
Chicago Tribune about freedom in Brazil, he replied that “to an outsider” there was
the impression of a “good deal of freedom”. However, conversation with academic
people, he reported, revealed strongly restrictions to freedom of speech and teaching,
also showed in censorship to the main newspapers. Brazil, Friedman suggested, was
not a totalitarian country (with an “overall control of every aspect of life”), but a
dictatorship, in the sense that individuals could do what they wanted, except when
“they crossed the government” and were punished for that.
         We would rather have a free society in Brazil, but few countries are able to
         sustain a free society for a long period. No South American country has been
         able to do it. Chile came close for a long period, and now look what has
         happened to Chile. (Friedman 1974c)

        The Chilean military coup d’état had taken place just two months before
Friedman’s trip to Brazil. It is noteworthy that Friedman’s sponsor, Eudoro Villela,
was close to Paulo Egydio Martins, Minister of Industry and Commerce in the
previous government, who would become governor of the state of São Paulo in 1974.
Martins belonged to a political group led by General Golbery do Couto e Silva, who
opposed the military hard line and designed a plan for gradual political
decompression implemented after 1974, when he became head of the Brazilian
Presidential Staff. As part of his strategy for liberalization, Golbery met with some
American scholars who visited Brazil, as the Harvard political scientist Samuel
Huntington, who came in 1972 and 1974 (Skidmore 1988, pp. 162-67). Friedman
probably met with Golbery in 1973, although he did not mention it in his 1974
interview. 9 He did mention long talks with Antonio Delfim Netto, the Brazilian

evidence that real wages increased in 1964 because of inflation expectations carried
from the previous year, along the lines of Friedman (1968), before wage indexation
was fully applied.
9 My inference is based on letters from J. Palhares dos Santos and Egydio Martins to

General Golbery. Palhares dos Santos’s letter to Golbery, dated 16 August 1973,
attached, under Martins’s request, a copy of the correspondence between Friedman
and Villela. Palhares dos Santos wrote to Golbery: “It seems to us that it would be
                                                                                     11


Finance Minister at the time. Delfim argued that empirical evidence indicated that
average real wages were on the rise because of increasing productivity, above and
beyond minimum wage legislation, which Friedman found convincing. Unlike the
1964-66 period, unemployment at the time was of a “structural”, not “cyclical”, kind,
associated to rigid minimum wages and other rigidities of the Brazilian labor market
(Friedman 1974c). That was consistent with Friedman’s (1968) definition of the
“natural” rate of unemployment.
         Three years after his travel to Brazil, Friedman delivered his Nobel Memorial
Lecture in Stockholm, when he advanced the view, based on some recent evidence for
industrialized countries, of a positively sloped Phillips curve, called “stage 3” of the
natural rate hypothesis (Friedman 1977). Such phenomenon could only be explained,
he claimed, if the interdependence of economic and political (or institutional) events
was taken into account, along the lines of the new political economy (ibid, p. 460).
The relevance of institutional changes for monetary dynamics became evident during
Friedman’s visits to Brazil (1973) and Chile (1975). One of the key issues tackled by
Friedman (1977, p. 465) was whether developed countries would continue along their
recent increasing inflation path – described as a move toward “the Latin American
pattern of chronically high inflation rates”, occasionally turned into hyperinflations
with political repercussions as in Chile and Argentina – or go back to their pre-World
War II pattern of long-run stable or “normal” price level. The relative long-run price
stability, in the sense that prices oscillated cyclically around an approximately steady
level, went a long way in accounting for the stable Phillips curves estimated for that
period, as Friedman (p. 469) observed.10
         Friedman (p. 464) saw a positively sloped Phillips curve as a transitional
phenomenon, lasting while not just expectations but also “institutional and political
arrangements” adjusted to chronic inflation. During the transition period, the partial
introduction of such arrangements would be associated with higher unemployment
produced by the effects of inflation on economic efficiency, as illustrated by the
South American record (see also Lothian 2016). Higher inflation would generally be
accompanied by higher price volatility and uncertainty – with perverse effects on the
working of the price mechanism and hence on economic activity – followed by the
development of indexation to try to cope with it. Until such institutional arrangements
were introduced, the transition from a monetary system featuring “normal” price level
to another one beset by chronic high and variable inflation would display a positive
Phillips curve. When (and if) the economy eventually adapted to chronic inflation,
through “full indexation” (p. 464) and other arrangements, the long-run Phillips curve
would become vertical as in the natural rate hypothesis. Friedman (1977) did not
mention Brazil, but his frequent references to indexation and chronic inflation
probably resulted from his 1973 visit to that country. Friedman (1977) did not offer a
normative argument in support of indexation (as he had done in 1974), but a positive



very important to promote a meeting between [Friedman] and ‘our people’ … as
secret as indicated”. Egydio Martins sent Golbery, in an undated letter, documents
related to a “follow-up to Professor Friedman’s visit to Brazil” (Paulo Egydio Martins
Papers, CPDOC-FGV-Rio; my translation). Friedman kept a low profile during his
travel to Brazil, which was not reported by the Brazilian press.
10 The notion of “normal” prices was essential to Dennis Robertson’s monetary

macroeconomics. Friedman may have borrowed it from the Cambridge economist
(Boianovsky 2018a).

analysis of indexing and other institutional changes as expected reactions to persistent
and variable inflation.


4. Discussion

Friedman’s (1966, 1968) references to Brazil in the context of his critical discussion
of the Phillips curve have not attracted much attention in the literature. Partial
exceptions are Lemgruber (1973, 1974) and Forder (2018), from quite different
perspectives. Brazilian economist Antonio C. Lemgruber (1974, pp. 1 and 192)
maintained that “post-war Brazilian inflationary experience provided the basic
evidence utilized by Friedman in his attack of Phillips curve theories of inflation”,
and that “the ‘informal’ evidence of [Friedman’s] theory was exactly the Brazilian
example” (p. 107). Inspired by Friedman’s “casual evidence”, Lemgruber (p. 2) set
out to test the accelerationist Phillips curve for Brazil (see also Lemgruber 1973, p.
31). By “informal” or “casual” evidence Lemgruber probably meant qualitative pieces
of empirical observation, apparently not as rigorous or persuasive as econometric
evidence.
        Forder (2018, p. 526), on the other hand, claimed that Friedman (1968)
discussed the Phillips curve in order to describe the results (not goals) of policy, “and
even then only in Brazil”. Moreover, Forder (p. 535) held that Friedman did not
support his point about expectations by careful theoretical or empirical arguments, as
the expectations effect was regarded common knowledge – “of all [Friedman’s]
discussions, only the mention of the Brazilian case even offered an instance of the
expectations effect”. Clearly, Friedman did not suggest that Brazilian policy makers
in the mid 1960s were trying to exploit a Phillips curve trade-off. However, his
reference to wage dynamics in a highly inflationary environment such as Brazil did
play a role in his rebuttal of Solow (1966), even if, unlike Lemgruber’s interpretation,
Friedman did not base his entire case on that.
        It is implicit in Forder’s assessment that the “Brazilian case” was of a distinct
sort from the American or British records, and therefore not as relevant for
Friedman’s point, which was supposed to apply to industrialized economies. Robert
Solow, the explicit target of Friedman’s 1966 criticism of the then prevailing
interpretation of the Phillips curve and (implicitly) of his 1968 Address as well, said
as much in his pioneer econometric evaluation of Friedman’s natural rate hypothesis.
Upon deriving, for the US and the UK, results that rejected the accelerationist
approach and the notion of a long-run vertical Phillips curve, Solow stated:
        I think there is a message here: whatever may be true of Latin-American-size
        inflations or even smaller perfectly steady inflations, under the conditions that
        really matter – irregular price increases with an order of magnitude of a few
        percent a year – there is a trade-off between the speed of price increase and the
        real state of the economy. (Solow 1969, p. 17)

That clearly was a reaction to Friedman’s (1966, 1968) attempted use of the Brazilian
inflation to make his point. 11 Solow’s reaction was illustrative of the general
perception among American and British economists that Latin American high

11There were some problems in the way Solow (1969) estimated his equations, as
Friedman (1975, p. 24, n. 2) and others would point out, which raised skepticism
about his non-accelerationist result.
                                                                                    13


inflation did not prove Friedman’s case. As evidence of inflation acceleration in
industrialized economies started to come out, the notion of a Non-Accelerating
Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU), even if not necessarily the natural rate
hypothesis, gained prominence.
        Even if the Brazilian example did not persuade Solow and others, it did play
an important role in the construction of Friedman’s argument, as he forecasted that a
similar shift of the short-run Phillips curve would take place in the US. Referring to
the Phillips curve, Friedman (1977, p. 469) claimed that, “as in any science, so long
as experience continued to be consistent with the reigning hypothesis”, as it happened
until the 1960s, “it continued to be accepted, although, as always, a few dissenters
questioned its validity”. Friedman’s approach to business cycles along NBER lines
and his Marshallian methodology, as Hammond (1996, p. 44) pointed out, were
behind his view that economists should focus on concrete problems and that
observation was more relevant than mathematical elegance and completeness.
Friedman believed the “ultimate test of theories was their capacity for predicting data
other than those from which they were derived” (ibid). Friedman’s use of his
Brazilian observation to predict the instability of the American Phillips curve may be
seen as an illustration of that.
        South American high inflation economies provided illustration of yet another
important monetary phenomenon: the “Fisher effect”, that is, the impact of inflation
expectations on the nominal rate of interest. Friedman saw it as the credit market
equivalent of his argument about the influence of inflation expectations on money-
wages. Evidence of the Fisher effect came mostly from South American countries
such as Brazil and Chile, where high and rising interest rates had been historically
associated with fast increase in money supply (Friedman 1968, pp. 6-7). It was only
after the mid 1960s, when American investors gave up their previous notion of a
“normal” price level, that evidence of co-movement between nominal interest rates
and inflation started to show in the US economy as well (ibid; see also Nelson 2017,
book B, pp. 138-39).
        Impressed by his 1973 travel to Brazil, Friedman speculated, in his 1976
Nobel Lecture, whether US inflation was approaching the chronic Latin American
pattern. Friedman’s trip was prompted by his curiosity about the Brazilian economy
and its mechanisms to cope with inflation. However, as he would point out years later,
the Brazilian “economic miracle” did not last long (Friedman and Friedman 1998, pp.
426-27). The country was beset in the 1980s and early 1990s by near hyperinflation
and balance of payments problems. New currencies were introduced “in the vain
attempt to achieve by name changes what required a real commitment to reduce
money supply” (ibid). Friedman’s critical account of Brazilian monetary reforms
(especially the 1994 “Real Plan”) missed the point that widespread staggered
indexation, together with accommodating monetary and fiscal policies in the face of
adverse aggregate supply shocks, had turned Brazilian inflation into a random walk
(Simonsen 1983, p. 131). In the 1980s and 1990s, the notion that inflation was
predominantly “inertial” gained increasing assent among Brazilian economists, which
culminated with the successful 1994 stabilization through monetary reform and end of
indexation after a transition period (see Andrade and Silva 1996).
        Friedman’s ([1963] 1968, 1966, 1968) interest in the Brazilian inflation
experience may be also explained by the context of the Latin American “structuralist-
monetarist” debate, which reached its climax at the Rio 1963 international conference
(Baer and Kerstnetzky 1964). In fact, the term “monetarist” – introduced by Campos
(1961), who, like Gudin, sided with the monetarist camp – first gained currency
                                                                                14


during that debate. The Latin American discussion took place before the monetarist
controversy that would soon dominate macroeconomics (Boianovsky 2012; Laidler
2004, sec. 3). Friedman, like some other Chicago economists, was aware of the 1950-
60s Latin American debates, and of the relevance of the information provided by
aspects of high inflation in that region and the attempts to stabilize it.
