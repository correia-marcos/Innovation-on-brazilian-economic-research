There are scarce but relevant researches stating the importance of educating
socioemotional competencies to the youth as it impacts individual’s success in life, and
what is even more scarce is the analysis of the results and impact of programs that work
towards that educational goal, either implemented though public policies and
Government funded projects. This paper seeks to evaluate the impact of the Academia
Educar Project in 2016, focusing on its’ development of socioemotional skills on
students using the methods of Propensity Score Matching and Differences in
Differences. Positive and significant effects were found on Sociability (12% of initial
value), Assertiveness (16% of initial value) and Political Participation (double the initial
percentage of treaties interested in participating in the country's policy). The results for
Locus Control and Imaginative variables were significant and in the direction expected
only in part of the specifications; for Volatility, the results do not suggest impact.
Several robustness analyzes were performed to validate the results found.

1. Introduction
        The relevance of the present research can be understood based on two distinct
factors: as it analyses the impact of a program it opens precedent for other programs to
be analyzed and the reflection upon certain results indicate best ways to move forward,
knowing what might be more effective in terms of its educational goals. Adding to that,
we must point out how relevant it might be to a society the subject of this: the education
and future success in life of the youth, which might be enhanced through the
development of socioemotional skills.
        Government policy implementations carried out by State Governments and Non-
Governmental Organizations need to have a clear evaluation of results to use their
resources more efficiently. Despite its importance, the evaluation of public policies is
still not that common, although it has been growing recently. (MENEZES-FILHO,
2010). This research is highly focused on understading results through data, and
applying this analysis in the future to further improve the program.
        Academia Educar is the first project developed by Fundação Educar DPaschoal
and began to be idealized in 19895. The project promotes the training of young leaders
in public schools, creating opportunities for 13 to 16-year-olds to discover their natural
capabilities, empowering them to transform the reality of their schools and
communities. The project is based on the four pillars of education established by
UNESCO: Learning to Be, Learning to Live, Learning to Learn and Learning to Do.
        For the evaluation, two field surveys were carried out. First, the diagnostic
questionnaire was applied to all students in the treatment and control group. This initial
research, conducted in March 2016, aimed to know both the socioeconomic
characteristics of each student and their cognitive and socioemotional skills. The second
round of questionnaire was taken in November of the same year to collect only
information related to the students' socioemotional and cognitive competences. On both
occasions, the students were responsible for completing the questionnaires applied.
        The present study seeks to evaluate the impact of the Academia Educar program
in 2016. To estimate the causal effect, two control groups are considered, in order to
mitigate possible estimation biases. The first control group is formed by the students of
the State School (EE) Profª. Maria Julieta de Godoi Cartezani, who had no students
selected to participate in the Academia Educar project in 2016. In this case, 186
students were selected for the control group. Using a control group of students from
another school has the advantage of avoiding the contagion caused by students in the
treatment group.
        For the second control group, 41 students from EMEF6 Odila Maia Rocha Brito,
a school with students participating in the project, were selected. There is a concern in
this analysis with knowledge that was taught being passed along to other students of the
school, since this transfer was a part of the project itself. That is why having a control
group within the school might have led to an underestimation of the impacts of the
project. Due to the low number of students selected in this control group, we used these
students with the control group cited above for a validation check of the results.
        To investigate the effect of the Academia Educar program on impact indicators,
the students selected to receive the intervention in 2016 (treated) with the students who
did not receive the intervention (control) were compared. For this, a combination of the

  Municipal School of Elementary Education.
propensity score method with Differences in Differences7 is used. Several robustness
analyzes were performed to validate the results found. In general, the results indicate
positive and significant impacts on the Sociability, Assertiveness of students and on the
interest in participating in national politics. For the Locus Control and Imaginative
variables, the results were not conclusive. For the variable Volatility, in all estimates,
the results did not indicate that the program had an impact.
         All this program analysis focuses primarily on the understanding of
improvements on perceived socioemotional skills as it lays upon the premise that those
skills can be a proxy to individuals success, which relates to the Academia Educar’s
own objective and is a matter of investigation in researches as we can better explore in
the upcoming paragraphs.
         There is a meager amount of impact analysis of programs that seek to promote
individual and collective success by developing socioemotional skills. On the other
hand, several studies examine the effects of cognitive ability, such as Farkas et al
(1997), Murnane et al. (2000), Kerckhoff et al. (2001), Farkas (2003), Riani and Rios-
Neto (2008). Recently, researchers have begun to investigate the role of non-cognitive
skills and their applications, Sarzosa and Urzúa (2015) and Oliveira et al. (2017)
investigate how social-emotional skills help mitigate the effect of bullying. Cunha et al.
(2010) show that individuals with more non-cognitive skills in childhood are more
likely to increase their cognitive indicators and Gensowski (2012) shows how lifetime
financial gains are influenced by education and personality traits.
         Lleras (2008) shows that non-cognitive behaviors measured in high school have
significant effects on later educational achievement and higher income. These effects
appear to be as important and perhaps more important than cognitive abilities in
determining outcomes. However, the benefits of skills and behaviors are different from
the groups. For example, non-cognitive behaviors seem to play a more important role in
explaining the female and Asian advantage in educational attainment compared to
cognitive ability.
         Many researchers have attempted to understand how academic performance and
cognitive ability have determined social performance and schooling. Some early
researchers point out the importance of non-cognitive skills, as good predictors of
success in life were Bowles and Gintis (1976).
                According to Carneiro et al. (2007), economists often have a simplified
view on how socioemotional skills act as the determinants of economic and social
outcomes. This is because these abilities are intrinsically multidimensional. This study
also identifies how non-cognitive skills affect the possibility of young people smoking
at age 16, health status at age 42, employment status at age 42. The work suggests that
non-cognitive skills appear to be more malleable than cognitive abilities. If this is true,
an education policy that focuses on non-cognitive skills may be more effective at
generating increased social and economic outcomes than one that targets only cognitive
abilities. Almlund et al. (2011) also consider more malleable personality traits
throughout the life cycle than cognitive ability, which becomes highly stable at around
10 years of age. His work suggests that interventions are capable of changing
personality traits and promising ways to address poverty and disadvantage.
         A survey conducted by the National Center for Workplace Education (NCEQW)
in 1995 asked employers to rate some characteristics or attributes regarding their
criticality in the hiring decision. Employers tend to minimize school-based factors in

7

making their decisions. Characteristics and attributes, such as the candidate's attitude,
communication skills, previous work experience, and current employers'
recommendations, seemed to be more important than full years of schooling, test scores,
academic performance and teacher recommendations (STASZ, 2001). In 1997, the
NCEQW achieved the same result, suggesting that the view on skills persists over time,
even when economic conditions and overall labor demands fluctuate, as Shapiro and
Goertz (1998) argue.
        Heckman et al. (2006) use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
to verify that non-cognitive skills are at least as important as cognitive abilities to
explain some social performances in life. For example, non-cognitive skills seem to
have a strong influence in making decisions about school choice, work and occupation.
The authors point out the importance of including these skills in explaining the
likelihood of one engaging in risky behavior.
                There are different options when trying to measure the personality traits
of an individual. Mischel et al. (1989) used an experiment called the Marshmallow Test,
which showed that 4-year-old children with greater ability to postpone rewards tend to
be smarter, more likely to have greater social responsibility, and postponement time is
significantly related to higher grades in the SAT 8 . These results suggest that the
relationship between the delaying the reward and the ability to cope with a range of
social and personal problems is not entirely attributable to schooling.
        Santos and Primi (2014) investigated the description of the socioemotional
profile of students in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, and Soto et al. (2011) investigated the
profile of students in various places around the world and found similar results. In the
above-mentioned studies, the data reflect that girls tend to be more conscious,
extravagant and enjoyable. On the other hand, girls had less emotional stability. Both
group of researchers used the “Big Five9 Model”, which was suggested as relevant for
measuring personality traits in the context of education by Kyllonen et al. (2008). This
same model is in parts used in this research to understand students’ characteristics and
development throughout the process.
                In addition to this introduction, a brief description of the Academia
Educar project is presented below. Section 3 provides descriptive analysis of data from
Academia Educar. Section 4 presents the identification strategy used and section 5 the
results obtained. Finally, the last section brings the final considerations of the paper.
2 Description of the Academia Educar
        The project works in partnership with 20 schools (10 municipal and 10 state)
and has support from the Departments of Education East and West and Municipal
Education Secretariat of Campinas-SP, receiving about 100 direct participants, 5
students from each of the schools.
        In the Academia Educar, teenagers exercise their mind in workshops that happen
twice a week, out of school hours (one class in the morning and another in the
afternoon). They also develop, once a week, the multiplications, that is, workshops from
1h to 2h for other students of the schools participating in the project. These workshops
have a responsible educator who helps in the performance of the students. In addition,
there are some challenges developed throughout the year that contribute to the
development of technical knowledge and social-emotional skills. The Academia Educar
project wants to foster Youth Protagonism, wants to make them know their rights and

duties as a citizen. The goal is for young people to be able to transform their reality,
starting with their school and evolving all the way to reach their community. The target
audience of the program is precisely the students of the public schools of Campinas,
aged between 13 and 16 years who are studying from the 9th year of Elementary School
II to the 2nd year of High School.
         Several workshops are held with these young people with the aim of developing
their leading role in their own context. The idea is that young people are able to lead
projects that foster their community’s development. In addition to the training, the
participants are challenged and commit to carry out 8 projects engaging the entire
community and replicating the knowledge acquired to the other students of the school,
throughout the year. With respect to these projects at school, the idea is for the
youngsters to identify needs within their schools and then come up with projects to
address these needs. For example, if there is a problem of difficulty in reading in the
school, the youngster may suggest Reading, Storytelling workshops and so on.
         The project lasts one year (school year). There are 250 hours and 102 hours of
training (which take place at DPK10 Campinas, twice a week - Tuesdays and Thursdays,
within 3 hours) and 148 hours, 148 hours dedicated to the production of the 8
challenging projects: Multiplication in school; Station Experience; Oasis Educar;
Catavento de Letras; Catavento de Números; Knowing the world; School Project and
Closing Show.
         The State Department of Education delegates to the Directorates West and East
the indications of the schools seeking to contemplate the various districts of each region
and also receive indication of desire for renewal manifested by the Educar DPaschoal
Foundation of the schools that have participated in previous years. The Municipal
Secretariat sends a communication via e-mail to the municipal schools and those that
express interest are contemplated by order of arrival.
         Once the participating schools have been defined, they must indicate who will
be the teacher of the school in the Educar project. There is always a school educator
who acts voluntarily. In the Academia Educar, the educators of the schools are a core
part in the process of development of the juvenile leadership. Each school has an
educator that supports the project. Participating schools must share with the values of
the Academia Educar.
         At Academia Educar, the idea is to help develop youth to become leaders who
are capable of initiating change and one of the keys to success in the project is in the
presence of young tutors11. These young people, after passing through the development
period as students, are invited to become tutors for the next batch of students in the
following year. They hold weekly meetings to create the workshops according to the
proposed theme. In addition, each tutor "sponsors" some schools to follow the
multiplications with the students, giving tips and enhancing the development of the
beginners and the results obtained in the project.
         Another important point in this process is the choice of students who will
participate in the program. First, staff at the Educar DPaschoal Academy team
announces the program to their students. Afterwards, the young people interested
participate in a group dynamic, conducted by the technical staff of Academia Educar,
which lasts from three to four hours and takes place in school. From this group

dynamic, the Educar DPaschoal Foundation team and the young tutors select which
students will join the Academia Educar of the year.
         The eligibility criteria are: to be enrolled between the 9th year of the high school
and the 2nd year of the middle school in public schools that adhered to the project in the
current year and between 13 and 16 years old. However, during the group dynamic, the
technical staff of the Academia Educar mainly observes the interest and willingness of
the student to participate. Secondly, they also observe the posture under pressure,
initiative, cooperation / teamwork, commitment, flexibility, among others. It is based on
these abilities that the team decides who will be selected. In short, criteria such as the
commitment and willingness of young people to participate are major deciding factors.
3. Descriptive Analysis
         In this section, we describe the data used for the impact assessment of the
Academia Educar 2016 project. We present the information regarding the treatment
group and then those of the control group. In addition, a friction analysis is performed.
Finally, a subsection presents a simple comparison of the treatment and control groups
in the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods.
         An important analysis is the friction of students in the treatment and control
group. Friction is the loss of observations (relative to the initial design) that occurs in a
field survey. Every program has the objective of treating all its candidates, however, a
part of the candidates leaves the treatment for several reasons. Thus, when we return to
the field to interview students after treatment, a portion of the initial sample is lost. The
same may occur for the control group. In the case, we had a friction of 25% in the
treatment group and 21.14% in the control group - these numbers are precisely the
difference between the ideal response rate (without friction) and the observed response
rate.
         Inferences may be biased if this friction is not random, that is, when individuals
who did not respond to the (second) survey are different from the group as a whole. To
verify that the field friction did not mischaracterize the initial sample, generating a
sample selectivity, are compared the initial treatment12 and control13 groups with the
sample that did not respond to the final field survey using the variables collected at the
initial time of the Academia Educar survey.
         In the pre-treatment period, the participants of the Academia Educar project are
the students of the 9th year of Elementary School II, 1st and 2nd year of High School,
respectively 49.3%, 46.6% and 4%14. The students in the treatment group are 36% boys
and 64% girls. According to Table 1, the average age of the boys is around 14 years,
with a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 16 years.
         Regarding schooling of the student’s parents, 61.3% of these parents present a
level of schooling up to the 5th year of Elementary School, 28% of them have
completed High School and 10.6% did not specify. Regarding the level of schooling of
the mother, 62.6% have a level of education up to the 5th year of Elementary School,
34.6% have completed High School, 2.6% did not specify. In relation to family income,
93.3% have an income between R $ 0.00 and R $ 3,000.00.

12
   The treaties that left the Program do not differ from the total initial sample. In terms of their observable
characteristics they showed no significant divergence at 90% confidence.
13
   Only the variable Volatility was statistically significant (10% significance when the control group was
formed by the students of the school in which there was no treaty and 5% of significance when we
grouped the youngsters of the two schools to form the total control group).
14
   Only the students who answered the two questionnaires were considered.
       Regarding the students in the control group, Table 2.1 shows that 6.7% of the
young people are 8th grade students, 44.6% are 9th year of Elementary School II and
48.6% of students are attending the 1st year of high school. The control group consists
of 47.5% girls and 52.5% boys. The average age of young people is around 15 years.
       The schooling of the parents is composed of 88.3% up to the 5th year of
Elementary School and 10.6% present the complete High School. The level of
education of the mother up to the 5th year of elementary school is 85.4% and with high
school is 14.5%. The family income is formed by 79.8% with income between R$ 0.00
to R$ 3,000.00, and with income over R $ 3,000.00 is 20.1%.
3.1 Descriptive analysis of treatment and control group in pre-intervention and
post-intervention
       As previously explained, the data collection for the evaluation occurred in two
phases. At the first moment (baseline), the students answered a questionnaire about their
socioeconomic characteristics and socioemotional competences. After the intervention
of the program, the students of the treatment and control group answered again the
questionnaire about their social-emotional abilities. Table 1 presents the information
regarding the treatment and control groups in the pre-intervention period.

     The greater the value of the locus of control, the more unstable the student is in terms of his emotional

    It is possible to observe that after the intervention the students are statistically
different to 90% confidence in all socioemotional skills and political participation. The
only variable that decreased value refers to control locus, where lower values mean
more emotionally stable students. For all other characteristics the values increased,
revealing that after the intervention students improve their non-cognitive skills and
political participation.
         It is also noted that the control group before and after intervention are similar in
terms of their socioemotional characteristics and political participation. This result is a
good indication, as students who did not participate in the Academia Educar program,
further reinforcing the results found for the treated students.
4 Empirical strategy
4.1 Identification hypothesis
         The objective of the Academia Educar project is to provide young students with
the development of their socioemotional competencies through the protagonism and
knowledge of their rights and duties as citizens, so that they are able to transform their
reality and their community.
         To investigate the causal relationship of these factors several experimental and
non-experimental techniques are used in the impact assessment literature. Among them,
the method of differences in differences is widely used by researchers, either alone or in
combination with other methods16. This research uses quasi-experimental techniques to
identify the causal relationship of the program to the indicators of interests.
         To estimate the causal effect, two control groups are considered, in order to
mitigate possible biases of estimation. The first control group consists of students from
a school that does not have students belonging to the program, 186 individuals. This
control group has the advantage of avoiding the contagion caused by the students of the
treatment group, as discussed in section 2. The second control group is formed by
students from one of the participating schools, 41 individuals; totaling 227 students.
This second control group is used as a way of testing the robustness of the results.
         The school not participating in the program chosen for the control group is
similar to the schools that participate and is also easier to access to the project
management team. The groups that answered the questionnaire were from the same
grades that participated in the project and all the students present on the day answered
the questionnaire. At the end of the year, the Educar team returned to these same
classes.
         When selection for participation in a program occurs randomly, this mechanism
provides the necessary balancing of observed and unobserved characteristics of the units
that make up the two groups, Angrist and Pische (2008). Randomization allows us to
create a situation in which there is no correlation between being treated and the
attributes of the observation units (participants). If the exposure to the policy is random,
one can compare two groups: one that received the program (treatment group) and one
that did not (control group). Then, the difference in students' performance in the two
situations (treatment and control) is calculated to evaluate the impact of the program.
However, due to the non-random selection of the Academia Educar program, this
procedure is not the correct one to apply. As shown in Table 2 of section 3, it is noted


16
  The propensity score and the method of differences in differences were proposed by Heckman,
Ichumura and Todd (1997, 1998).
that the treatment and control groups are distinct in terms of their observable
characteristics before the intervention.
        Due to the significant differences between the treatment and control groups, the
propensity score method is used. This method allows finding young people of the
control that are as close as possible to the treaties. Pre-project information regarding
student demographics, socioeconomic backgrounds (parental schooling, family income,
etc.) and cognitive ability (questions of logic applied to the questionnaire) will be used
to make these students look alike17.
        In addition, since we collected information on our impact indicators of interest at
the beginning of the evaluation, we will also use the difference-differences method.
This method allows us to eliminate unobservable differences that are fixed in time. The
causal effect of the program can be found statistically. To validate the causal effect,
several robustness tests will be performed, since the method used is not without
problems.
        This strategy allows to estimate the effect of the treatment, that is, the impact of
the intervention of the Academia Educar on the social-emotional abilities of the
participants of the state and municipal public schools of Campinas / SP. The main
hypothesis of the differences in differences method is that the temporal trajectory of the
outcome variable for the control group represents what would occur with the treated
group, in the absence of the intervention, Menezes-Filho et al. (2012). In our case, it is
necessary that the average of the social-emotional abilities have pre-treatment 18
trajectory parallel to that of the participants of the control group. Our specification
model is:
        Socioemocional𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽4 (𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡 𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,
        Socioemocional𝑖𝑡 in which refers to a socioemotional characteristic of student i
at time t; 𝑋𝑖𝑡 are control variables; 𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡 if participant i is treated, that is participates in
the Academia Educar project, and 0, otherwise; 𝑡𝑖𝑡 is a time dummy that assumes the
value 1 in the post-program period and 0 in the pre-program period and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error
term of the model.
        In sum, the hypothesis of causal evaluation of the Academia Educar program on
indicators of interest uses: i) the observed variables pretreatment that allows to select
from the control group those more similar to those treated; ii) the unobserved
differences are fixed over time. The combination of these two methods - matching and
differences in differences - allows us to identify causality and measure the impact of
intervention. Several robustness tests will be performed to validate the results.
4.2 Impact indicators of interest
        As stated in section 2, the objective of the Academia Educar project is to
"promote the formation of youth leaderships in public schools, creating opportunities
for young people to discover their potential and transform their reality." In short, two
measures would satisfactorily address this goal: youth protagonism and citizenship19.

Schooling Mother Ens. M. Student Education 2 Student Education 3 Major Income R $ 3,000.00 Books
More than 3 Access to Cultural Goods 2 Access to Cultural Goods 3.
18
   Although not a test for this hypothesis, an intuitive way of checking is to test whether the trajectory of
the outcome variable for the two groups has the same time trend.

19
  School learning can also be an indicator to be considered. But, the option was to focus on indicators
related to protagonism and citizenship.
However, we do not find anything so specific in literature. Therefore, we seek measures
correlated with these two aspects. The idea was to use SENNA items.
        The SENNA (Social and Emotional or Non-Cognitive Nationwide Assessment)
is an instrument developed by the Ayrton Senna Institute, in partnership with the
OECD, which consists of measuring the socioemotional competences of students in the
5th year of elementary school to the last year of high school. The issues that make up
the instrument relate to students' attitudes, feelings or perceptions about themselves. It
has items to measure the Five Great Personality Factors, the so-called "Big Five":
Opening to New Experiences; Extroversion; Kindness; Conscientiousness; and
Neuroticism (Emotional Stability), McCrae and John (1992). The items vary in a Likert
progressive scale ranging from 1 to 5, ranging from "totally disagree" to "strongly
agree," according to a person's belief in having a personality trait or characteristic. In
addition, the instrument also has items to measure Locus Control.
        For this evaluation, we selected some SENNA items. Specifically, we selected
items that include the following facets: Sociability and Assertiveness, from the
Extroversion construct; Volatility, from the construct Neuroticism; Imaginative, from
the construct of Opening to the New; and the items referring to measurement of control
locus.
        These items were chosen because they are related to the skills that the Academia
Educar team seeks to foster in the youth. Protagonism is related to having initiative - to
propose ideas; to be able to mobilize, encourage cooperation or teamwork; commitment
to goals; leadership. Citizenship is related to knowing their rights and duties -
something not contemplated in the items, it is true - but also, to the idea that 'making it
happen' depends on the young person, that is, he must assert his rights, something
captured at the locus of control, for example.
        Thus, the chosen impact indicators of interest are:
𝑌1 = Locus of control
𝑌2 = Sociability
𝑌3 = 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠
𝑌4 = 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦
𝑌5 = Imaginative
𝑌6 = 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
        It is important to clarify that in addition to the SENNA items, 'loose' items were
also included in the proposed instrument to capture the impact indicators of the
Academia Educar. These items were developed by the Academia Educar staff and are in
line with the dimensions prioritized by the project. One of the issues included addresses
the student's interest in participating in the country's politics. This issue has become one
of the indicators of evaluation.
        "Do you believe that you should participate in politics in your country?"
        () No () Yes
        The indicators from 1 to 5 were constructed, therefore, from a specific set of
SENNA 20 items. For this investigation, 3 proposals were used to construct these
indicators. The Locus control variable is constructed from 14 items belonging to the
SENNA questionnaire, since the Sociability feature is constructed from 8 SENNA
items. The variable Volatility is based on 6 items of the questionnaire, since the
Imaginative feature is constructed based on 4 items and Assertiveness is constructed

20
     The likert scale is used in the SENNA questionnaire.
from 2 items of the SENNA questionnaire. Finally, the dependent variable Political
Participation is a binary variable that assumes the value 1, in case the student believes
that he should participate in the policy in his country and 0, otherwise.
         Proposition 1 uses 34 items, proposal 2 uses all the items present in the
questionnaire, that is, 49 items and proposal 3 is constructed from the items indicated by
the factorial analysis. The questionnaire has five levels of responses, thus, for each
competency was added the value given for each response and then divided by the
number of items corresponding to each social-emotional characteristic. In this way, each
characteristic has a numerical value between 1 and 5.
         To measure the internal consistency of these indicators, Table 3 reports the
Cronbach's Alpha, whose objective is to evaluate the magnitude in which the items of
an instrument are correlated. The internal consistency is better the closer to 1 it is value.
It is the reason that we use 3 proposals for building social-emotional skills. Although,
there is no precise rule about alpha values, some authors consider the small internal
consistency for alphas smaller than 0.21. For alpha between 0.40 and 0.21, the
consistency is said to be reasonable. Values between 0.60 and 0.41 are considered
moderate. If the alpha is between 0.80 and 0.61, the consistency is considered
substantial and for values greater than 0.80, the instrument is almost perfect.

        According to Table 3, the different proposals present moderate and substantial
results, Landis and Koch 21 (1977). The applied diagnostic questionnaire can
satisfactorily construct the proposed socioemotional indicators.
4.3 The control variables
        To estimate the impact of the Academia Educar in 2016 on indicators of interest,
a large set of characteristics of the students is considered, including age, gender,
cognitive abilities, socioeconomic characteristics and family characteristics, as
described in Table 2. These variables are used to define if the treatment and control
groups are similar - when controlling for these observed variables we are reducing the
potential bias from non-observable sources, that is, we seek to find the "clean" treatment
effect.
        The choice of these characteristics derives from the empirical literature and also
from the database informed by Academia Educar. Control variables can be found in
Frame 1.

   The authors consider values greater than 0.80 to have an almost perfect internal consistency, values of
0.61 to 0.80 are considered substantial, whereas values from 0.41 to 0.60 are moderate, from 0.21 to 0.40
is reasonable and less than 0.21 is considered small.

2.5 Results
        In this section, we present the results of the impact estimates for the indicators of
interest. In the first subsection, the presented results are based on the model of
differences in differences. The subsequent subsection presents the results from a
combination of methods using the matching and difference in differences model, which
are the preferred results because of the pre-treatment differences already observed
between students in both groups.
5.1 Estimates of impact of the Academia Educar assessment on the indicators of
interest - estimation through the differences in differences model
        This section presents the results of the diferences in differences model. Table 4
presents the results with two different control groups. Control group 1 is made up of
students from the E.E. Maria Julieta de Godoi Cartezani and EMEF Prof. Odila Maia
Rocha Brito. Control group 2 is made up of students from the E.E. Maria Julieta de
Godoi Cartezani, that is, by students who are in a school that does not participate in the
Academia Educar project. The results with different control groups is one way of
showing the robustness of the results.

        Table 4 shows that the Academia Educar program had an impact on the Locus
competences of control, sociability and political participation. The negative sign of
Locus of Control means that the students who participated in the program have
improved this competence, i.e., students feel more in control of their own lives,
demanding more of themselves and focusing on what they can do on their own to deal
with their respective problems. The impact on sociability and political participation are
also in the expected direction, i.e., students who participated in the project presented
greater variations in the indicators of sociability and political participation than students
who did not participate in the project. The results for the variables Assertiveness and
Imaginative were positive, but were only significant for control group 1; for control
group 2, the impact results decrease in magnitude and are no longer significant. For the
variable of interest Volatility, the results were not statistically significant for any of the
control groups.
5.2 Estimates of impact of the Academia Educar assessment on the indicators of
interest - estimation through propensity score and differences in differences model
        This subsection presents the results from a combination of methods, using the
propensity score and the difference in difference model. This method allows individuals
to be searched in the closest22 control group and uses the results of these individuals to
obtain what would be the outcome of the individual in the treatment group if they were
not treated.
        First, based on the vector 𝑋 described in Frame 1, we estimated an equation for
the probability of the individual participating in the treatment. This procedure was
performed separately for each dependent variable analyzed, as well as for each control
group. Then, the kernel matching 23 estimates were obtained. In Appendix A are
presented the logit models for the probability of the individual being treated (Table A1),
as well a balanced quality analysis (Table A2 and Table A3). Table 5 presents the
results of the program.

    confidence.
           According to Table 5, participation in the Academia Educar project has an
   impact on the variables of interest Sociability, Assertiveness and Political Participation.
   For Locus control, the result was only significant for the control group 1. Compared to
   the results in Table 4, the positive results remained for Sociability and Political
   Participation.
           The treated before the intervention were less sociable than the control and after
   the program the sociability was even greater. This result is expected because of the
   program's operation, since young people work too hard this skill during the program.
   Regarding political participation, there was no significant difference before the program
   and after the Academy Educate the treaties have a greater political participation. This is
   also expected because of the character of the program, which seeks to foster the youth
   protagonism, wants to make them know their rights and duties as a citizen.
           Again, no impact was observed on the variable 'Volatility'. For the Imaginative
   variable, the results indicate null impact for Control Group 1 and negative when we
   consider Control Group 2. The negative result for Imaginative is not found in other
   specifications, most of the time the models suggest a positive impact, but statistically
   insignificant.
           Table A4, in Appendix A, presents estimates for the same models from Table 4,
   but using other pairing algorithms - specifically, matching by the nearest neighbor. We
   worked with 1 and 2 neighbors, always with replacement, that is, the same observation
   of the control group could be combined with more than one treated unit. As can be
   observed, the results of Table 4 are confirmed: positive and significant impacts for
   Sociability, Assertiveness and Political Participation. In these specifications, however,
   Imaginative appears with a positive and significant signal for control group 1 and not
   significant for control group 2. No significant and consistent impacts are estimated for
   Locus of Control nor for Volatility, results also already pointed out in Table 5.
           As previously stated, one of the ideas was to explore different ways of
   constructing the socioemotional measures used in this evaluation. Thus, in tables A4
   and A5 of Appendix A, the same results are shown in Table 5, but using these
   alternative proposals for measures of social-emotional indicators. In these tables of the
   appendix no results are presented for the variable of political participation since it is
derived from a single question of the questionnaire, therefore, there are no different
possibilities of measurement for this variable.
        The results of tables A4 and A5 confirm the impact of the Program on the
measure of sociability - in all specifications the results are positive and significant,
indicating that Educar contributes to a greater sociability of its participants. For other
measures, the results are as strong. The Locus of Control, Imaginative, and
Assertiveness variables present positive and significant results in some specifications,
but in general it does not appear that the results are robust. For the variable Volatility, as
in the first specification, the results suggest that there is no impact.
        In terms of magnitude, according to the data in Table 2, the mean of the
Sociability variable for the pre-intervention treaties was 3.127 - this means that an
impact of 0.396 (according to the results in Table 5 - control group 2) represents 12% of
the value of the variable in the baseline. The same rationale for the Assertiveness
variable implies a 16% impact of the value of the variable at the baseline (mean before
treatment was 2.92 with impact of 0.463). For the variable of interest in participating in
the country's policy, the impact is quite large: impact of 42 percentage points. At the
baseline 47% of the students said they had an interest in participating in the country's
politics; due to the participation in Projeto Educar Project, in the end, 90% of the
students said they are interested in participating in the country's politics.
6 Final considerations
        The objective of this study was to present an impact assessment of the project
Academia Educar of Educar DPaschoal Foundation, specifically the final results of the
impact assessment on aspects related to socioemotional skills of students. Two field
surveys were carried out to carry out the evaluation. A first cadastral survey of each
student in early 2016; and a second survey at the end of the same year. The two surveys
collected the impact indicators of interest, related to socioemotional characteristics.
        The evaluation was based on the treaties that participated in the program in
2016. The control group chosen was formed by students who did not participate in the
Academia Educar project. There are two distinct groups of controls, the first group is
made up of students from two partner schools of the DPaschoal Foundation, but one of
the schools has young people participating in the project. The second control group is
formed only by young people from the school that is not participating in the program.
The hypothesis of identification for the causal evaluation of the Academia Educar
program on socioemotional indicators and political participation utilizes the observed
pre-treatment variables as well as the method of differences in differences to deal with
unobserved variables that are fixed in time.
        The results of this evaluation should be read with all the necessary caution when
we think that we do not have the perfect instruments to measure social skills, as well as
when we remember that we did not have a lot to define the treaties, but rather a
selection process that seeks to choose the most motivated / interested to participate.
        We use different impact indicators associated with the socioemotional skills of
the project beneficiaries. According to the results obtained, the program has a positive
and statistically significant impact on Sociability and Political Participation. For
assertiveness we also defend that there is an impact. The results obtained for this
variable in proposal 1 are positive and significant for all specifications that use the
combination of matching and differences in differences. Therefore, we conclude that
this variable also has an impact. The results for Locus Control and Imaginative
variables were significant and in the correct direction in part of the specifications; for
Volatility, the results do not suggest impact.
         It is important to emphasize, the evaluation relied on baseline data and with
several robustness exercises, which leaves us more confident in terms of the credibility
of the results. One suggestion would be to accompany the students, so that long-term
effects could be measured and it would be possible to know the effectiveness of the
Academia Educar, that is, the duration of the impact.
