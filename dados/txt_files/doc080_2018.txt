This paper examines the relation between capital accumulation, income distribution and
the real exchange rate in the Brazilian economy using a sectorially disaggregated database
for the period 2007-2014. The industrial sectors are grouped into two categories according
to the intensity of technological innovation: (i) medium-low and low; and (ii) medium-
high and high. Two different methodologies are used for estimations: (i) the Arellano–
Bond GMM method to handle the endogeneity between investment and the profit share;
and (ii) panel vector autoregression to capture the impact of exchange rate devaluation on
capital accumulation, taking into account the feedback of the profit share, labour costs
and degree of capacity utilization. The results suggest a non-linear relationship between
investment and income distribution in the Brazilian economy for both groups of sectors.
However, the pattern of the relation between capital accumulation and income
distribution differs according to the intensity of innovation. The results also indicate that
an exchange rate devaluation has a positive effect on capital accumulation, particularly
for the sectors more intense in technology innovation.

O objetivo deste trabalho é examinar a relação entre acumulação de capital, distribuição
de renda e a taxa real de câmbio para a economia brasileira em um nível setorialmente
desagregado para o período entre 2007 e 2014. Para tanto, os setores foram agrupados
conforme a intensidade tecnológica: (i) média-baixa e baixa, e (ii) média-alta e alta.
Utilizou-se duas metodologias econométricas: (i) um painel estimado por Arellano-Bond
visando lidar com a possível endogeneidade entre investimento e o profit-share setorial,
(ii) um modelo de painel com vetores autoregressivos para capturar o efeito de feedback
entre as variáveis. Os resultados sugeriram uma relação não-linear entre o investimento e
a distribuição de renda setorial, mas com diferentes funções entre as varáveis de acordo
com a intensidade de inovação tecnológica setorial. Além disso, a taxa real de câmbio se
mostrou um importante vetor para a promoção da acumulação de capital, particularmente
para os setores mais intensos em inovação tecnológica.

Introduction

Income distribution is a central variable in the determination of capital accumulation. In
this context, changes in income distribution between capitalists and workers can boost
investment because the profit is related to the availability of funds to finance capital
accumulation. From this perspective, Lima (2004) argues that investment is a non-linear
function of income distribution. His point is that capitalists invest in technologies to
decrease labour costs. Then, sectors with a small profit share (or high labour costs) have
high capital accumulation. On the other side, according to the structuralist
macroeconomic theory, the real exchange rate is a fundamental variable in the promotion
of capital accumulation A devaluated or competitive exchange rate means a profit-led
policy insofar as it increases the profit share in the national income. Depending on the
structural characteristics of the economy, exchange devaluation policies can trigger
investment in technological progress.
       The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to examine the relation between
capital accumulation, income distribution and real exchange rate for Brazilian industrial
sectors. Secondly, to assess the possibility that the relation between income distribution
and capital accumulation follows a non-linear pattern, testing if such function is concave
or convex. To this end, we employed a sectorially disaggregated database for the period
between 2007 and 2014. Two different methodologies are used for estimation: (i)
Arellano and Bond’s GMM method to handle the endogeneity between investment and
the profit share; and (ii) panel vector autoregression to capture the impact of exchange
rate devaluation on capital accumulation, taking into account the feedback of the profit
share, labour costs and degree of capacity utilization.
       In addition to estimating these models for the Brazilian economy as a whole, this
paper analyzes two groups of sectors according to the intensity of technological
innovation: (i) medium-low and low and (ii) medium-high and high intensity (Galindo-
Rueda and Verger, 2016). To the best of our knowledge, the analysis of the effects of
income distribution and exchange rates on capital accumulation, taking into account a
distinction between sectors by technological intensity, represents an original contribution
to the literature.
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The first section discusses the
relation between income distribution and economic growth from the Kaleckian
perspective as well as the non-linear relation between income distribution and
technological progress. The structuralist macroeconomic perspective on the importance
of the exchange rate is discussed in the second section. The third section presents the
empirical literature on income distribution, real exchange rate and growth. In the fourth
section, the empirical strategy adopted in the paper is presented, while the database of the
estimations is discussed in the fifth section. The results of the regressions are discussed
in the sixth section. The paper ends with the conclusion.

1-     Income Distribution and Growth

      The importance of income distribution in the understanding the economic growth
has been a field of research since the seminal work of Kalecki (1954). In the 1980s, some
authors explored the Kaleckian idea that the income distribution between workers and
capitalists is a central variable explaining economic growth (Rowthorn, 1981; Dutt, 1984,
1987; Taylor, 1985; Amadeo, 1986a, 1986b, 1987). According to them, increases in the
wage share always promote the expansion of aggregated demand, capital accumulation
and, hence, economic growth. Grounded on Steindl (1979) and Kalecki (1954), Bhaduri

                                                                                          2
and Marglin (1990) and Kurz (1990) developed more flexible theoretical models in which
the economy can be wage-led or profit-led. In these models, changes in the functional
income distribution and its impacts on economic performance depend on the structural
characteristics of the economy. Thus, the economy is not always wage-led, as for the neo-
Kaleckians. The Bhaduri/Marglin–Kurz models are known as post-Kaleckian models
(Hein, 2014; Lavoie, 2014).
      Following the Hein’s (2014) synthesis of the post-Kaleckian theory, the basic
equations are as follows:
                                               u
                                         r = hv                                       (1)

where r is the rate of profit, h is the profit share, v is the capital–potential output ratio, m
is the markup, 𝑠 is the saving rate, 𝑠𝜋 is the propensity to save out of the total profits, g is
the capital accumulation, where α represents the animal spirits, and u is the rate of
utilization. The condition of equilibrium is for investment to be equal to saving:
                                           g=σ                                               (5)

                                        − ∂u > 0, so sπ v − β > 0                            (6)
                                     ∂u

Satisfying the condition of equilibrium, the equilibrium rate of capacity utilization is:
                                              α+τh
                                       u∗ = h                                             (7)

Replacing the equilibrium rate of capacity utilization in the equation of capital
accumulation, the equilibrium accumulation and saving rates are:
                                                                                    h

       According to equations (9) and (10), the effects of changes in the income
distribution on the equilibrium rate of capacity utilization (output gap) and capital
accumulation (investment) depends on the parameters of the saving and investment
functions.
       Equation (9) shows that an increase in the profit share will create a positive effect
on the economy if the elasticity of investment in relation to the profit share is higher than
the propensity to save. Economies with this characteristic have profit-led, or
exhilarationist properties. Otherwise, if redistribution of income in favor of workers
creates a positive effect on capacity utilization, the economy has wage-led properties or
a stagnationist regime (Bhaduri and Marglin, 1990). In turn, equation (10) indicates that
redistribution of income to capitalists will enhance (decrease) capital accumulation if the
elasticity of investment is higher (lower) than the sensibility of investment to capacity
utilization. In this case, the economy follows a profit (wage)-led regime. In sum, the

relation between income distribution and economic performance depends on the
structural characteristics of the economy, that is, whether the economy is profit or wage-
led.

      1.1-     Investment and Income Distribution: A Non-linear Relation

      An important hypothesis raised by Lima (2004) is the non-linearity of capital
accumulation regarding to income distribution between capitalists and workers. It
assumes that investment is endogenous to income distribution in two manners: a) as long
as the investment has a saving-labour nature in a capitalist economy, higher wage shares
constitute incentive to capital accumulation; b) the profit share is related to the availability
of own funds to finance capital accumulation. Such endogeneity between capital
accumulation and income distribution entails a non-linear investment function
represented by:
                                     d = Ω − Ω2                                            (11)
where d is investment in technological innovation and Ω is income distribution
represented by the wage share. This function is a concave-down parabola with two real
roots, h(0)=h(1)=0, so vector d is positive over the domain given by the values of σ
between 0 and 1 (Lima, 2004). The level of distribution that maximizes technological
innovation in σ* is 0.5. In this specification, extreme values of income distribution
correspond to lower values of technological innovation, while intermediary values of
income distribution correspond to higher levels. Lima (2004) explains this pattern as
follows:
                         (…) the rate of innovation is lower for both low and high levels of wage share,
                         it being higher for intermediate ones. While at high levels of profit share the
                         availability of funding for innovation is high but the incentives to innovate are
                         low, at low levels of profit share the incentives to innovate are high but the
                         availability of funding is low. (Lima, 2004, p. 391)

      When the wage share is higher (lower), the investment in technologies – which
increase productivity and decrease the number of workers employed, is higher (lower)
(Lima, 2004). The non-linearity is justified by the fact that, in sectors in which the wage
share is larger (smaller), the own funds to finance new investments are lower (higher). In
short, there is a feedback effect between investment and income distribution. In sectors
with a larger wage share, capitalists are encouraged to invest in technological progress to
decrease employment and, thereafter, increase the profit share.

2-     Growth, Capital Accumulation and Real Exchange Rate

       In the Kaleckian distribution and growth models the role played by the real
exchange rate on the open economy analysis depends on the relationship between income
distribution, the real exchange rate and demand/growth regimes, as well as on the analysis
of the relationship between domestic redistribution and international competitiveness.
The real exchange rate is an argument in function of exports and imports and as an
indicator of international competitiveness (Blecker, 1989; Bhaduri and Marglin, 1990) in
a manner that increasing competitiveness can be caused by an increasing nominal
exchange rate, hence a nominal depreciation of the domestic currency, increasing foreign
prices or declining domestic prices. The effect of changes in distribution on international
competitiveness will depend on the cause of distributional change (Hein, 2014). In other


                                                                                                        4
words, the real exchange rate becomes a fundamental element in the analysis of growth
because it affects the price competitiveness of exports.
       On the other hand, following the Keynesian-structuralist framework especially the
Kaldorian approach and the balance-payment growth theory, a consensus has emerged
that the management of real exchange rate is a necessary condition for adequate long-run
macroeconomic performance of developing countries. In theoretical terms, the real
exchange rate is the central variable in promoting capital accumulation and the growth of
developing countries, as it allows companies to acquire frontier technologies and improve
the competitiveness of national production (Bresser-Pereira, 2012).
       In this sense, Frenkel and Taylor (2006) show that a weak real exchange rate is a
necessary condition for development inasmuch as it defends the profitability of industry
from the competition with imports. They suggest that higher prices of imported goods
stimulate the internal demand. In turn, this upward movement of demand leads to
increases in productivity through a mechanism a la Verdoorn (1949), which reinforces
the exportation growth. Therefore, the real exchange rate can be used to alter the structural
parameters of economic system (Barbosa-Filho, 2006).
       Gala (2007) argues that real exchange rate affects the long-run growth through
investment and technological change. He introduces this variable into Bhaduri and
Marglin’s (1990) model, showing that the real exchange rate is an important determinant
of income distribution, influencing the capital accumulation. Gala (2007) concludes that
exchange devaluation causes an income transfer in favor of capitalists, which means a
profit-led policy. Gala and Libânio (2011) qualify this point by arguing that exchange
devaluation improves investment if the gains in profit make up for the loss in capacity
utilization due to the decline in the real wage.
       Missio (2012) demonstrates that changes in the real exchange rate alter the income
distribution, influencing companies’ decision to invest in technological progress, arguing
that companies’ financing of investments in technological progress depends on their own
funds through retained earnings. Thus, changes in real exchange rate alters the income
distribution through the production costs (real wage), promoting the investment in
technological progress. Ribeiro et al. (2016) build a model to investigate the effects of
exchange devaluation in non-price competitiveness via changes in income distribution
and the rate of technological innovation. It is concluded that exchanged devaluation turn
the price of the imported intermediate inputs in the unit production cost (reducing the
profit share) and shift the monopoly power of domestic firms (in this case the profit share
and the RER are positively related). Therefore, the theoretical literature points that the
transmission channel by which the real exchange rate affects the growth is the income
distribution.

3-      Empirical Literature

      Regarding the Brazilian case3, several empirical works employed various databases
and time series econometric methodologies, with non-conclusive results on the effects of
income redistribution on economic performance.
      Araújo e Gala (2012) employed single-equation time series methodology to assess
what are the regimes of demand and capital accumulation for a quarterly database for
period 2002-2008. They conclude that the demand regime is wage-led while the capital
accumulation regime is profit-led. Feijó et al (2015b) studied the demand regime for the
period 1951-1989 using a yearly database through DGLS methodology, their results
       3

a survey of empirical literature related to international experience.

pointed that Brazilian demand regime is profit-led. Feijó et al (2015b) seek to
comprehend the regime of capital accumulation during 1995-2009. To this end, the
authors used a SVAR model to show that Brazilian economy is under a wage-led regime
of capital accumulation.
       Morrone (2015) used the Granger test to assess the hypothesis that profit-share
granger-causes the investment for the period 1950-2008. Such hypothesis was not
corroborated leading the author to affirm the possibility that Brazilian economy has a
wage or profit-led in certain periods. Avirtzer et al (2015) assess the effect of income
distribution in favor of wage share by level and growth effects, it is not found empirical
evidences in favor of growth effects for period 1952-2001. However, the level effect has
proved valid since 1994. Tomio (2016) studied the demand regime for the period 1956-
2008 through single equation methodology, concluding that demand regime of Brazilian
economy is wage-led. Jesus et al (2017) used VAR and Granger causality to study the
growth and demand regimes for the period 1970-2008. The authors showed that both
regimes are profit-led. The Table 1 summarizes the already shortly discussed empirical
literature.

       There is a vast literature of empirical works that displays the importance of real
exchange rate for economic growth (Blecker, 2007; Rodrik, 2008; Bahmani-Oskooe and
Hajilee, 2010; Rapetti et al, 2014; Vaz and Baer, 2014; Missio et al, 2015).
       Confirming the robustness of relation between real exchange rate and growth, there
is a specific literature that explored the such empirical relation for Brazilian economy. In
this line, Oreiro et al (2011) employed a quarterly database to assess the relation between
real exchange rate and economic growth, their empirical evidences showed that exchange
appreciations are related to minor growth rates during 1994-2007. Oreiro and Araújo
(2012) tested the non-linear relation between capital accumulation and real exchange rate.
The authors pointed a positive and diminishing relation between exchange depreciations
and capital accumulations (convex function). Missio et al (2018) investigated the relation
between real exchange rate and capital accumulation for the period 1996-2017, it is
concluded that such relation is positive and non-linear (convex function).

      Baltar et al (2016) tested how the sectorial investment is affected by real exchange
devaluations during 1996-2011, they concluded that exchange devaluations are related to
expansions in capital accumulations of industrial sectors.
      Nonetheless, there is a literature which relates the real exchange rate to structural
change process – deindustrialization. Marconi and Rocha (2012) investigated how the
real exchange rate affected the deindustrialization of Brazilian economy between 1995
and 2008. They concluded that the valuated real exchange rates contributed to Brazilian
deindustrialization. Araújo and Peres (2018), employing a sectorial database for 1996-
2012 period, showed that the periods with an appreciated real exchange rate changed the
Brazilian productive structure in favor of primary activities in detriment of sector more
technologically advanced. Therefore, in Kaldorian terms, the real exchange rate is an
important variable in order to promote the long-run growth thought structural change.

       In sum, several empirical works showed the importance of functional income
distribution and real exchange rate to explain the economic performance as much to
international as to Brazilian experience. Such literature is overwhelmingly orientated to
explain the economic growth by employing aggregated cross-country databases. It is
obvious that this literature makes some generalizations on sectorial, regional
homogeneity (among other aspects), which is clearly an oversimplification facing the
complexity of modern capitalist economies. Using sectorial-level data allows us to
capture specificities observed across sectors according the intensity of technological
innovation.

4-       Empirical Strategy

       4.1-       Panel Estimation

      The empirical strategy consists of estimating four specifications for three groups of
sectors according to the intensity of innovation.4 The first specification aims to capture
       4
         The sectors are split into two groups according to the intensity of technological innovation
following Galindo-Rueda and Verger (2016). The two groups are defined as medium high and high intensity
(MHH) and medium low-low (MLL) intensity.

the relation between sectorial investment 𝐼𝑡,𝑛 and the profit share 𝜋𝑡−1,𝑛 , non-linear profit
         2
share 𝜋𝑡−1,𝑛   , real exchange rate 𝜃𝑡,𝑛 and wage share of costs 𝜔𝑡−1,𝑛 , where n and t stand
for sectors and time, respectively:
           It,n = b0 + b1 It−1,n + b2 πt−1,n + b3 π2t−1,n + b4 θt,n + b5 ωt,n + εt,n     (13)
       The second specification is the latter equation with a dummy for sectors in which
the profit share is larger than the average of all sectors.5 This variable is important,
because sectors with a larger profit share can have a specific pattern of capital
accumulation, since their funds to finance the investment tend to be larger:
 It,n = b0 + b1 It−1,n + b2 πt−1,n + b3 π2t−1,n + b4 θt,n + b5 ωt,n + b6 dummy + εt,n (14)
       The third specification contains a vector to capture the relation between the wage
costs and the profit share represented by 𝜆𝑡−1,𝑛 . Such vector is the ratio between the profit
share and the payroll, representing the notion presented by Lima (2004) according which
the capital accumulation is a function between income distribution between capitalists
and workers. By introducing the term 𝜆𝑡−1,𝑛 squared, it is possible capture the non-
linearity relation describe by Lima (2004). Moreover, the advantage of this specification
is the lower number of variables and the removal of a source of collinearity between the
labour costs and the profit share, which means an efficiency gain:
                     It,n = b0 + b1 It−1,n + b2 λt−1,n + b3 λ2t−1,n + b4 θt,n + εt,n     (15)
The fourth specification is equation (15) with a dummy for sectors in which the profit
share is larger than the average of all sectors:
           It,n = b0 + b1 It−1,n + b2 λt−1,n + b3 λ2t−1,n + b4 θt,n + b5 dummy + εt,n    (16)
       In empirical terms, there are two problems in the specifications: the endogeneity
between the investment and the profit share/income distribution and the serial correlation
caused by the introduction of lagged independent variables as explanatory variables. To
solve these problems, the study adopted the methodology of Arellano and Bond’s GMM
estimator.

       4.2-       PVAR Estimations

       By using PVAR, the empirical strategy consists on estimating one model to all
sectors with two lags according the criteriums of information. It is estimated only one
specification with the variables: sectorial investment, real exchange rate, non-linear ratio
between the profit share and the payroll and the degree of utilizing capacity6. The degree
of utilizing capacity is an important determinant of capital accumulation. However, this
variable is introduced just in the PVAR estimations. The reason for this is the strong
correlation between the degree of utilizing capacity and the others explanatory variables,
which can cause a kind of bias and enlarger the variance of errors in the estimations using
Arellano-Bond GMM estimator. It should be noted that this is not a problem for the
PVAR estimations because just the impulse response function (IRF) will be analyzed.
        Introduced by Holtz-Eakin, Newey and Rosen (1988), the panel of autoregressive
vectors (PVAR) is originated from the original VAR model developed by Sims (1980).
The idea is that the variables are endogenous and interrelated, as the original model, but
the PVAR considers the cross-sectional correlation and the dynamics over time, as an
econometric panel. These characteristics mean that this methodology take into account
the heterogeneity cross section, which enforces a specific structure to covariance matrix
       5
          This vector’s mean values equal one in sectors in which the profit share is larger than the average
profit share and zero in sectors in which the profit share is smaller.
        6
          We chose don’t split the database according the intensity of technological innovation in the PVAR
estimations because the integration between the sectors can change the results of IRF.

(Canova and Cicarelli, 2013). We estimated a PVAR model according Abrigo and Love
(2016), with a fixed effect structure, as follow:
     𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑦𝑖,𝑡−1 𝐴1 + 𝑦𝑖,𝑡−2 𝐴2 + ⋯ + 𝑦𝑖,𝑡−𝑝+1 𝐴𝑝−1 + 𝑦𝑖,𝑡−𝑝 𝐴𝑝 + 𝑥𝑖,𝑡 𝐵 + 𝑢𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖,𝑡 (17)
where 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 is a vector (1xk) of dependent variables, 𝑥𝑖,𝑡 is a vector (1xL) of exogenous
variables, 𝑢𝑖 is the fixed effect, 𝑒𝑖,𝑡 the idiosyncratic errors, A and B are the estimated
parameters. In relation to the errors, it is assumed that 𝐸[𝑒𝑖,𝑡 ] = 0, 𝐸[𝑒′𝑖,𝑡 𝑒𝑖,𝑡 ] = 𝛴 e

GMM estimator is:
                               A = (y̅∗ ′ZW ̂ Z′y̅∗ )−1 (y̅∗ ′ZŴ Z′y̅∗ )                            (18)
where 𝑊  ̂ is a matrix of weight (LxL) non-singular, which increases the efficiency. In the
next section, it discussed the database.

5-         The Database

      The variables utilized in this work are described in Table A1 (Appendix A). The
database is yearly, between 2007 and 2014. The sectors correspond to CNAE 2.0. The
proxy for profit share is computed from the available data of the IBGE-PIA.7 The
computation procedure takes the difference between the total revenue and the total costs
for each sector, dividing this result by the sum of the aggregated value of all sectors.
Using the same database, the wage share in the costs is calculated by dividing the total
sum of the payroll of each sector’s companies by the total costs. The sectorial investment
is taken from the IBGE-PIA data too. The real exchange rate of each sector is calculated
by the IPEA considering 23 countries and 2010 as the base year8 (2010=100). The
variable rate of capacity utilization is obtained from the National Confederation of
Industry.9 The dynamics of each variable is presented in the graphs below.

6-          Empirical Results

       6.1-       Panel Results

       The regressions of the first specification are presented in Table 3.10 The results (with
or without the dummy for the sector with a larger profit share) suggest that only the
parameters of the linear version of the profit share and wage share of costs are statistically
significant when considering all sectors at the 1% critical level. The signals of these
variables are negative and positive, respectively. The results for the sectors with medium-
low and low innovation intensity show that the parameter of the linear profit share is
negative and significant at the 1% critical level. The variable wage share of costs is
positive and significant at the 1% critical level. The other variables are not significant
with the exception of lagged investment, which is significant without the dummy but non-
significant with its introduction. In relation to the sectors with medium-high and high
intensity of innovation, the regressions show that the linear profit share is positive and
statistically significant at the 10% critical level. The variable real exchange rate is positive
and significant at the 10% critical level.
       The results of the first specification suggest that the non-linear profit share is not
significant for the three groups of sectors as well as the dummy for the sectors in which
the profit share is larger than average. Though the linear profit share is significant for the
three groups of sectors, the signal is negative for all sectors and the medium-low and low
sectors, which suggests that these sectors have wage-led properties. In turn, such signal
is positive for medium-high and high sectors, pointing that these sectors have profit-led
       10
         One of the assumptions of the instrumental variable is the absence of correlation between the
instruments and the independent variable. The Sargan or Hansen test (when the robust variance–covariance
matrix is used) has the null hypothesis that the instruments are exogenous. The Hansen test suggests the
acceptance of the null hypothesis of all the regressions. In turn, the Arellano–Bond test for autocorrelation
has the null hypothesis that the error does not follow an AR (1) or AR (2) process. However, it is usual for
the Arellano–Bond test to reject the null hypothesis of autocorrelation of order (1), because the term 𝑒𝑛𝑡 is
present in ∆𝑒𝑚,𝑡−1 and in ∆𝑒𝑚,𝑡−2 . The Arellano–Bond test for AR (2) is more important for detecting
autocorrelation. In the regressions, the Arellano–Bond test accepts the null hypothesis of AR (1) and AR
(2) autocorrelation of errors.

properties. That is, an income distribution police in favor of workers or capitalists has
different effects according the intensity of innovation.
       The variable real exchange rate is significant and positive only for the sectors with
medium-high and high innovation intensity, which means that real devaluation of the
exchange rate increases investment in sector more intensive in technology. Such result is
attuned to theoretical literature since those sectors are profit-led. In another hand, the
statically significance of wage share of costs and the positive signal for all sectors and
medium-low and low innovation intensity entails that investment of these sectors respond
positively to increases in costs with labour, as pointed by Lima (2004).

       The advantage of the second specification is the smaller number of explanatory
variables and the lesser degree of collinearity, since there is a correlation between the
profit share (linear and non-linear) and the wage share of costs. For this reason, the
efficiency of the second estimation tends to be greater when compared with the first
model. In turn, a smaller error variance reduces the probability of type II errors. Beyond
that, the correlation between one explanatory variable and one instrument may create bias
in the specification. The estimations of the second specification are presented in Table 4.
The econometric testes indicated that the regressions fit well.11

         The Hansen test suggests non-rejection of the null hypothesis that the instruments are exogenous,
and the Arellano–Bond test indicates the non-existence of autocorrelation of order (2) for all the regressions.

       The results of the regressions considering all the sectors (without the dummy) show
that the linear version of the ratio between the profit share and the payroll share of costs
is significant at the 1% critical value and negative, while the non-linear vector is positive
and significant at the 5% critical value. By introducing the dummy for the sectors with a
larger profit share, the results changed. The linear version of the ratio between the profit
share and the payroll share of costs is not significant, but the non-linear vector is
statistically significant at the 5% critical level and positive. The dummy, in turn, is
significant at the 1% critical level and positive. Meanwhile, the parameter of the real
exchange rate is positive and significant at the 10% critical level.
       The regressions for the sectors with medium-low and low innovation intensity
(without the dummy) indicate that the linear version of the ratio between the profit share
and the payroll share of costs is significant at the 5% critical level and negative, while the
non-linear version is significant at the 1% critical level and positive. The real exchange
rate is positive and significant at the 1% critical level. When the dummy for the sectors
with a larger profit share is introduced, the linear version of the ratio between the profit
share and the payroll share of costs is not significant. However, the non-linear vector
remains unchanged (positive and significant). The variable dummy for sectors with a
greater profit share is positive and statistically significant, just like the real exchange rate.
       With respect to the estimations for the sectors of medium-high and high intensity
of innovation (with or without the dummy), both linear and non-linear parameters of the
ratio between the profit share and the payroll on costs are significant and, respectively,
positive and negative. The dummy for larger profit share is statically significant at 10%
level and positive. By introducing it, the already results obtained kept unchanged, but the
real exchange rate becomes significant at the 1% level and positive.

       The estimations of the second specification show that the sectors in which the profit
share is larger than average have higher levels of capital accumulation, indicating that
these sectors own more funds to finance investments. More than that, by introducing such
dummy variable the magnitude and significance of real exchange rate parameter changed
in the three cases: i- it became significant and positive for all sectors; ii- it reduced from
0.17 (statistically significant at 1%) to 0.01 (statistically significant at 10%) for sectors
with low and medium-low intensity of innovation; iii- such parameter became positive
and around 0.21 for sectors with high and medium-high intensity of innovation. Such
results suggest that the real exchange rate – given its relation with sectorial profit share –
influences capital accumulation via profitability so that the effects of devaluations are
stronger in sectors more intensive in technology.
       The results also confirmed the non-linear relation between income distribution and
investment. Nonetheless, the curve that describes this relation differs across the sectors.
Whilst the shape of the curve for the Brazilian economy (all sectors) and the sectors with
medium-low and low innovation intensity is convex, the curve for the sectors with
medium-high and high innovation intensity is concave.
       The different patterns of the curve that describes the relation between capital
accumulation and profit share are suggestive of unlike sectorial behaviors in relation to
investment and income distribution. Lima’s (2004) hypothesis is valid for the sectors with
medium-high and high innovation intensity. That is, these sectors have high (low)
investment when the ratio between the profit share and the wage share of costs is low
(high). Considering that capital accumulation is endogenous in relation to income
distribution, the entrepreneurs of these sectors increase the investment when the wage
share of costs increases. However, though the non-linearity is valid, the results confirm
that Lima’s (2004) hypothesis is not valid for the Brazilian economy (all sectors) and for
the sectors with medium-low and low innovation intensity. That is, these sectors have
high (low) investment when the ratio between the profit share and the wage share of costs
is high (low). This means that the entrepreneurs of these sectors increase the capital
accumulation when the wage share of costs decreases.

       6.2-       PVAR Results

       The impulse response function (IRF) is presented in the Graphs 6 12. The Graph 6
illustrates how the PVAR system reacts to one positive shock13 in the real exchange rate
(exchange devaluation). The IRF shows that an exchange devaluation increases the ratio
between the profit share and the payroll (i.e. promotes a redistribution of income in favor
of capitalists), which means that the profit share increases or that payroll decreases. In
both cases the accumulated earnings of capitalists increases, which leads to greater own
funds and, hence, boosting the capital accumulation. It should be noted that, during this
dynamic, the degree of utilizing capacity has upward dynamic from the fourth year
       12
           It is presented just the IRF from a shock in the real exchange rate because this is the focus of this
paper. There is no necessity to discuss the other IRF focusing in a shock in income distribution, investment
or in the degree of utilizing capacity.

in costs with labour) decreases the investment, demonstrating robustness of our

Conclusions

      This paper examined the relation between income distribution, the real exchange
rate and capital accumulation in the Brazilian economy using a sectorially disaggregated
database for the period 2007-2014. It estimated two specifications using the GMM
methodology of Arellano and Bond to handle the endogeneity between the profit share
and investment. The first specification rejected the hypothesis of a non-linear relationship
between income distribution and capital accumulation. Furthermore, the results also
pointed that Brazilian economy (all sectors) and the medium-low and low sectors are
wage-led, whereas the medium-high and high sectors are profit-led. In turn, the variable
real exchange rate is significant and positive only for the sectors with medium-high and
high innovation intensity, which means that real devaluation of the exchange rate
increases investment in more technology-intensive sectors.
      However, the results of the first specification are not fully trustworthy, because (i)
the correlation between the instruments and the explanatory variables enlarges the error
variance (collinearity), which increases the probability of a type II error and (ii) it can
       14
         Nonetheless, it should be highlighted that the zero is contained in the confidence interval of IRF
in a manner that there is the possibility that IRF are statistically non-significant, rigorously.

                                                                                                        15
generate some kind of bias. To solve this problem, the authors created a vector to depict
the income distribution, represented by the ratio between the profit share and the payroll
share of costs. Under this specification, Lima’s (2004) hypothesis of non-linearity has
proven to be valid.
      Nonetheless, the curve that describes the relation between income distribution and
investment has a distinct pattern for different sectors according to the intensity of
innovation. The estimations showed that this relation has a convex curve for the Brazilian
economy (all sectors) and sectors with medium-low and low innovation intensity while it
is concave for the sectors with medium-high and high innovation intensity. These results
mean that the sectors with medium-low and low innovation intensity have high (low)
investment when the ratio between the profit share and the wage share of costs is high
(low), while the sectors with medium-high and high intensity have high (low) investment
when the ratio between the profit share and the wage share of costs is low (high). The
results of the second specification indicated that sectors with a larger profit share than
average have more own funds to finance capital accumulation; hence, investment is
larger. Such results suggest that the real exchange rate – given its relation with sectorial
profit share – influences capital accumulation via profitability so that the effects of
devaluations are stronger in sectors more intensive in technology. On this line, the PVAR
results suggested that the transmission channel from exchange devaluation to capital
accumulation occurs through income distribution; that is, exchange devaluation increases
the profit share (or decreases the payroll share of costs), boosting the available funds to
finance investment.
