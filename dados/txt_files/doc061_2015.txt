Abstract: Brazil confirmed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2008, including an 80%
reduction in deforestation in the Amazon by 2020. With this in mind, we investigated the trade-off
between environmental conservation and economic growth in the Amazon. The aim of this study is to
project the economic losses and land-use changes resulting from a policy to control deforestation and the
rise in land productivity that is necessary to offset those losses. We developed a Dynamic Interregional
Computable General Equilibrium Model for 30 Amazon regions with a land module allowing conversion
between types of land. The results have shown that the most affected regions would be soybeans and
cattle producers as well as regions dominated by family farms. To offset these impacts, it was estimated
that an annual gain of land productivity of approximately 1.4% would be required.

   1. Introduction and Background
        Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has attracted the attention of researchers and public
authorities towards methods and policies that involve both its measurement and control. In addition to the
importance of conserving one of the largest biomes of ecological diversity (Peres et al., 2010) and
harboring the largest area of primary forest in the world - 35% of the world’s total primary forest (FAO,
2010) - the region has become the target of policies to reduce deforestation because it constitutes an
important measure in the mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG).
        The Amazon region has already lost about of 15% of its total forest area. However, according to
INPE (2013), there was a decline in deforestation rates from 2004 to 2012. This decline is related to
economic factors, such as the reduction in international soybean and beef prices and the appreciation of
the Brazilian currency, which discouraged exports. Another contributing factor is the increased
surveillance of the Amazon, which has been made possible by the implementation of government
programs, such as the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon
(Soares-Filho et al., 2009; Assunção et al., 2012).
        Arima and Verissimo (2002) pointed out that the three major forms of deforestation in the
Amazon are: i) the conversion of forest into pasture for livestock; ii) cutting and burning to convert forest
into crops for family farming; and iii) deployment of grain crops by agro-industry. Of these, the
conversion of forests into pasture is predominant (Margulis, 2003). They have also argued that the drastic

reduction in tax incentives for agricultural enterprises in the late 1980s lead to a reduction in the pace of
deforestation, which, however, did not occur. In the 1990s, other factors than the government
development projects1 became more decisive in the maintenance of deforestation, primarily predatory
logging, extensive livestock farming and agrarian reform settlements2.
        Some projections suggest that deforestation, despite a reduction in its rates between 2004 and
2012, may expand in the coming decades. Soares Filho et al. (2005) estimated that the projected
deforestation will eliminate 40% of the current 5.4 million km2 of forests by 2040 if the occupancy
patterns follow the trajectory of the last two decades. Moreover, an increase in deforestation implies a
growth of GHG emissions associated with changes in land use. According to Gouvello (2010)’s
estimates, the total emissions from land-use changes and forests in Brazil may grow by 25% by 2030,
reaching an annual rate of 916 thousand tons of CO2 equivalent, which may compromise the target
reductions of reducing GHG proposed by the Brazilian government.
        The latest deforestation estimates in the Amazon published by INPE (INPE, 2013) showed that
from 2012 to 2013, there was an approximate 30% increase in the deforestation rate, which seems to
confirm these previous projections. Although it is the second lowest rate recorded by INPE since the
monitoring system began in 1988, it is an indication that deforestation could increase in the future. The
prospect of increased deforestation in the Amazon has even more force when considering the adoption of
some measures in the New Forest Code3, which was approved in May 2012. Included among the points of
the New Code is a reduction of the limit of the legal reserve (RL) in the region4 and a regularization of the
smallholder farmers, excluding them from the obligation of recovering areas that were deforested in
permanent preservation areas (APPs.) According to IPEA (2011), the recovery of deforested legal
reserves would offset the emissions of 3.15 billion tons of carbon, which would be enough to meet the
Brazilian government’s four-year target to reduce emissions from deforestation.
        This target assumed by the Brazilian government was presented in 2009 at COP155. The proposal
was a voluntary reduction in GHG emissions mainly through an 80% reduction in deforestation by 2020.
Thus, combating deforestation in Brazil has become a priority for the government as well as for the
international organizations that are concerned with global warming’s effects. According to Fearnside
(2005), an effective surveillance and the collection of taxes from those who do not have authorization
from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) should be
accompanied by the necessary understanding of the social, economic and political aspects of the region.
Bringing this concern to the economy of the regions in the Amazon, the question arises as to how the
control of deforestation can restrict agricultural expansion, which represents an important economic
activity in the region. Without alternatives for growth in agriculture and other sectors, which are
indirectly affected, there may be a tradeoff between the goals of regional economic growth and the
preservation of the forest.
        Some options are indicated to reconcile the economic growth of the region with sustainable
development and the reduction of deforestation. One refers to intensifying agriculture by increasing land
productivity. This increase in productivity would allow the same area, which has been deforested, to
produce a greater output amount without expanding the deforested area as crop or pasture land through
additional deforestation.

  The Brazilian Forest Code was created by Law No. 4771 on September 15, 1965. The Code sets limits on property use, which
must coincide with existing vegetation on the ground for the common good of all inhabitants of Brazil. The first Brazilian
Forest Code was established by Decree No. 23,793, on January 23, 1934.

  The portion to be preserved in the current Forest Code is 80%, but is decreased to 50% in states that have 65% of their
territory designated as protected areas or indigenous lands.

         In this context, it is relevant to investigate the aspects of a possible tradeoff between
environmental conservation and economic growth in the region. Furthermore, it is important to
understand the relationship among agricultural activities with the land occupation and use. The goals of
this paper, therefore, are: i) to evaluate the impacts of land-use policies on regional growth in Amazon6;
ii) to investigate the role of agricultural technical improvement in the region. We built an interregional
dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGE) for 30 regions in the Amazon and the rest of
Brazil, called REGIA (Interregional General Equilibrium Model for the Brazilian Amazon)7. REGIA has
a module of land-use change that enables it to model the conversion of different categories of land use.
The incorporation of the land module into REGIA is fundamental in the analysis of the effects of a policy
that restricts land use and directly affects the agricultural activity in the region.
         Therefore, REGIA was used to simulate a scenario considering the targeted deforestation
reduction of 80% by 2020 in accordance with the National Plan on Climate Change - PNMC (2008),
followed by a hypothetical zero deforestation policy from 2021 to 2030. Moreover, a simulation was
performed to estimate the land productivity gains needed to offset the adverse effects of the deforestation
policy on the Amazon economy.

    2. METHODOLOGY
    2.1 REGIA model
         REGIA is a Computable General Equilibrium model (CGE) with a recursive dynamic and land-
use module for 30 regions of the Brazilian Legal Amazon8 and the rest of Brazil. It is a bottom-up model,
that is, a multiregional model where the national results are aggregations of the regional results.
Moreover, it is the first CGE model built for the Amazon economy with this very detailed regional
disaggregation.
         REGIA has some improvements over other CGE models that also examined issues related to the
Amazon and deforestation, such as Pattanayak et al. (2009) and Cattaneo (2001). The first improvement
is the treatment of land use in a recursive dynamic model so we can analyze the impacts of different
scenarios over time as well as the endogenous adjustment of land supply. The second improvement is the
largest regional disaggregation - 30 regions of the Amazon and the rest of Brazil.
         REGIA has a core theoretical structure similar to the Australian TERM, an acronym for The
Enormous Regional Model (Horridge et al., 2005). TERM is a Johansen type bottom-up multi-regional
CGE model that is derived from the continued development of the ORANI (Dixon et al., 1982) model and
its generic version, the ORANI-G (Horridge, 2000). TERM was developed to address disaggregated
regional data and also to allow for the generation of faster solutions for simulations relative to available
models (Horridge et al., 2005).
         REGIA is composed of blocks of equations that determine relationships between supply and
demand, according to optimization assumptions and market-clearing conditions. In addition, several
national aggregates are defined in these blocks as the aggregate employment, GDP, balance of trade and
price indexes. The most productive sectors minimize production costs subject to a technology of constant
returns to scale in which the combinations of intermediate inputs and primary factors (aggregated) are
determined by fixed coefficients (Leontief). There is substitution via the prices of domestic and imported
goods in the composition of inputs according to the function of the constant elasticity of substitution
(CES). A CES specification also controls the allocation of a domestic compound among the various
regions. In REGIA, substitution also takes place between capital, labor and land in the composition of the

  REGIA refers to the aquatic lily pad that is typical of the Amazon region. It has a large leaf-shaped circle, which lies on the
surface of the water, and can grow to be up to 2.5 meters in diameter and support up to 40 pounds if well-distributed on its
surface.

primary factors through CES functions; however, the land factor is allocated only in the agriculture and
livestock sectors.
        The goods of a given region that are directed to another are compounded by the basic values and
the trade and transport margins. The share of each margin in the delivery price is a combination of source,
destination and goods source (domestic or imported). Margins on goods from one region to another can
be produced in different regions. It is expected that margins are distributed more or less equally between
the origin and destination or between intermediate regions in the case of transport from more distant
regions. In addition, there is substitution between suppliers of margins, according to a CES function.
        In the model, there is a representative household for each region consuming domestic and
imported goods. The choice between domestic and imported goods (from other countries) is held by a
CES (Armington assumption9) specification. The treatment of household demand is based on a combined
system of preferences, CES/Klein-Rubin. Thus, the utility derived from consumption is maximized
according to this utility function. The specification gives the linear expenditure system (LES) 10, in which
the share of expenditure above the subsistence level for each good represents a constant proportion of the
total subsistence expenditure of each family.
        The REGIA model has a recursive dynamic specification. Investment and capital stock follow
mechanisms of accumulation and intersectoral shift from pre-established rules related to the depreciation
and rates of return. Thus, one of the modifications to make REGIA a dynamic model was to connect the
annual investment flows to the capital stocks.
        The model does not include a process of temporal labor market adjustment. For the simulations in
this paper, which has a time horizon of 25 years, a configuration was adopted where the national
aggregated employment in the baseline is exogenous (from 2006 to 2011, adjusted with observed data,
and from 2012 is determined by population growth). In the policy scenario, the aggregate national
employment is fixed relative to the baseline scenario. This implies an endogenous response of the average
wage with the fixed sectoral wage and regional wage differentials. Thus, there is intersectoral and
regional labor mobility.
        Government consumption is exogenous. The model operates with market equilibrium for all
goods, both domestic and imported, as well as the market factors (capital, land and labor) in each region.
The purchase prices for each user in each region (producers, investors, households, exporters, and
government) are the sum of the basic values, sales taxes (direct and indirect) and margins (trade and
transport). Sales taxes are treated as ad valorem taxes on basic flows. Demands for margins (trade and
transport) are proportional to the flow of goods to which the margins are connected.
     2.2 The Land Use Module
        One of the advantages of REGIA is the incorporation of a land-use module. Land is one of the
primary factors in the model, in addition to capital and labor, and it is an important factor in the
production of agricultural sectors. Land use is modeled separately for each region, keeping the total area
fixed and divided into four types: i) cropland, ii) pasture, iii) planted forest and iv) natural forest and other
areas. In the model, the agricultural sectors/goods, as well as land use, are specific to each region.
        It is assumed that each agricultural sector of the model is connected to one of these types of land
uses. The area of natural forest and other uses is defined as the total area of each region minus the
cropland, pasture and planted forest. That is, it includes all of the areas that are not used in agro-forestry
systems, such as natural forests, urban areas, mountains, roads and rivers. These latter areas are thought to
change more slowly than natural forests, and therefore, the change (decline) in this type of land use is a
proxy for measuring deforestation by the expansion of agriculture or forestry.

 Armington hypothesis - goods of different origins are treated as imperfect substitutes.
10
  The LES function is suitable for broad aggregates of goods where specific substitutions are not considered. That is, cross-
price elasticities are equal to the income effect given in the Slutsky equation without any contribution from the cross-price
effects. This implies that all goods have a weak complementarity. The linear expenditure system does not allow the inclusion
of inferior goods (that is, negative income elasticities).

         Land may be allocated between different agricultural sectors according to the remuneration gap.
Thus, the demand for land responds to changes in the land remuneration to each sector. Each land use
(cropland, pasture and planted forest) is distributed in year t according to a CET (constant elasticity of
transformation) function11 between different goods for each region:
         𝑥𝑖𝑟 = 𝑥𝑟 + 𝛼𝑙𝑛𝑑 (𝑝𝑖𝑟 − 𝑝𝑟 )                                                            (1)
                                                                                   12
where 𝑥𝑖𝑟 is the percentage change in the demand for land allocated to sector i in region r; 𝑝𝑖𝑟 is the
percentage change in the land remuneration to sector i in region r; xr is the percentage change of the total
land (cropland, pasture and planted forest) in region r; and pr is the average remuneration to all sectors in
region r. Thus, if in one region the remuneration to sector i is above the average remuneration to the
region (𝑝𝑖𝑟 − 𝑝𝑟 > 0), then a positive change in the allocation of land will occur toward sector i.
         The total change in the demand for each land use for each region is given by 𝑥𝑟 = ∑𝑘 𝑆𝑘 𝑥𝑘 , using
the distribution of the remuneration 𝑆𝑘 , with k representing the various land uses . However, we should
adopt a physical limit to the total area in region r, which will be ∑𝑘 𝐻𝑘 𝑥𝑘 = 0, using the distribution of
land in hectares 𝐻𝑘 . Therefore, to maintain a constant total area, a physical variable in hectares, nkr, was
used for each land use by region r and computed by:
         𝑛𝑘𝑟 = 𝑥𝑘𝑟 + 𝜇                                                                           (2)
in which 𝜇 is calculated so that 0 = ∑𝑘 𝐻𝑘 𝑛𝑘 to guarantee that the total physical supply of land will be
fixed. Thus, the demand for land, according to the different uses, is connected to the land supply in the
model. The idea is that the demand for land, 𝑥𝑘𝑟 , influences the process of the conversion of land between
the uses, that is, the supply side, 𝑛𝑘𝑟 . In the REGIA model, this is operationalized upon determining that
the variation of demand for land is equal to the variation of supply for land. This mechanism guarantees
the equilibrium in the land market, fixing the total regional land available.
         The supply side of land will allow the factor to move between different categories of land between
year t and year t + 1. A CET function could not capture the conversion process between the types of land
uses. For this, the conversion process is controlled by a transition matrix representing the conversion
possibilities of land between year t and year t + 1. The matrix represents the mobility of land between
uses, indicating the possibilities of the transformation of different types of land.
         The transition matrix captures the fact that the most productive land is initially used in the
production process, and at the same time, the use of marginal land that could be converted into productive
use is limited. The economic process of land conversion is as follows: initially, forests would be
converted into areas for pasture, which ultimately could be converted into areas for cropland (Ferreira
Filho and Horridge, 2012; Cattaneo, 2002; Macedo et al., 2012; Barona et al., 2010). Therefore, the
matrix shows that the conversion between uses, such as cropland and pasture, for example, is more easily
performed than that for cropland directly from natural forests. If the difference between the amount of
land used in agricultural production and the total area of the region is large, the rise in the demand for
land will lead to the greater conversion of land for agricultural uses. This, in turn, will lead to an increase
in the remuneration of land to offset the costs associated with this conversion.
         The transition matrix was built based on the methodology developed by Ferreira, Filho and
Horridge (2014), and calibrated with satellite data from TerraClass13 2008 and 2010 (obtained from

   Within each region, the area of “Cropland’, for example, in the current year is predetermined. However, the model allows a
given area of “Cropland” to be re-allocated among crops according to a CET rule where CET = 0,5 (Ferreira Filho and Horridge,
2014).

(cropland, pasture, planted forest and natural forest) over time. Between two periods (years), the model
allows land to move between cropland, pasture, planted forest, or natural forest and to be converted into
one of the three. The transition matrix15 for Amazon are illustrated in Chart 1. The sum of the lines

2008, remained as cropland in 2010 according to INPE data. The first column also shows that 2.3 of 44.5
million hectares, which was pasture in 2008, converted to cropland in 2010. The last line shows the
transformation of natural forest into other uses, which can be understood as deforestation. For example,
4.3 million of hectares, which was natural forest in 2008, converted to pasture in 2010. And another 22.1
million of hectares was converted from natural forest in 2008 into planted forest in 2010.
        The land supply in each category (cropland, pasture, planted forest and natural forest) for each
region increases according to the annual percentage growth rate of each use given by the transition
matrix:
        𝑁 𝑘, 𝑡 + 1 = 100 × ∆𝑁𝑘,(𝑡+1,𝑡) /𝑁𝑘,𝑡                                                          (3)
        In addition to this annual growth rate, to adjust the transition matrix for the next period, the
current stock of land in year t is distributed for next year, t + 1, responding to changes in the remuneration
of land. The transition matrix can be expressed as a percentage share (that is, the total sum of lines is
equal to 1) showing the probability that a particular hectare of land used for pasture would be used the
next year for cropland. In REGIA, these probabilities or proportions are modeled as a function of the
variation in the remuneration of each type of land:

   The data used to construct the transition matrix were given by TerraClass. However, because the data source for the sectoral
output was from the IBGE, some adjustments had to be made using the Agricultural Census data because some sectors had
production according to IBGE data, but did not have output according to data from TerraClass. This adjustment was minimal
and represented less than 10% of the land-use data. The option for TerraClass data is explained by the quality of information
from satellite data compared to Census data, which is based on farmers’ responses.
15
   The transition matrix assumes that natural forests would be initially converted into areas for pasture and that after some time
would be able to be converted into areas for crops. We built a transition matrix for the 30 regions in Amazon and for the rest of
Brazil.

   The RAS method is an interactive mechanism that seeks to adjust the values of the rows and columns of a matrix, with its
total considering the proportionality of the total values. This method calculates a new set of values for a matrix of cells from a
previous structure, causing the sum of the rows and columns to be consistent with the expected total. More information about
the RAS method can be found in Miller and Blair (2009).

land of the type k. 𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑑 is a sensitivity parameter that measures the response of the supply of land in
relation to changes in the remuneration. 𝑀𝑘𝑟 is a shift variable with an initial value equal to 1.
        The sensitivity parameter, 𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑑 , represents the elasticity of land supply and was calculated
according to Van Meijl et al. (2006) and Farias (2012). The elasticity of land supply with respect to land
price changes should reflect the notion that greater land availability is related to higher values of
elasticity. We can see the elasticity by region in Table I. A greater availability of land implies an easier
process of land conversion in terms of costs. Thus, if the remuneration of cropland increases in relation to
the remuneration of pasture in year t (demand side), the rate of conversion from pasture to cropland will
increase, and thus, the amount of land devoted to cropland in t + 1 also increases. To model the
conversion rate of natural forests, it was necessary to consider a fictitious remuneration, in this case, the
Final User Price Index. Thus, the transition matrix is adjusted annually as is the supply of land.

     2.3 The Database
        The database for the REGIA model was constructed through a process of regionalization of a
national input-output matrix. The procedure was based on the methodology developed by Horridge
(2006) and was adapted for the Brazilian case. Basically, from input-output data for 2005 and a large set
of regional data, we estimated an interregional trade matrix using a distance matrix and a gravitational
approach. The main hypothesis of the gravitational approach17 is that interregional trade is based on the
distance between the regions and the interaction derived from the size of its economies.
        Details of the procedure for building a database for REGIA are in Carvalho (2014). The result of
this procedure is a consistency of the database with the official data of National Accounts, Input-Output

17
  A widespread theoretical justification for the idea that bilateral trade flows are positively associated with regional incomes
and negatively with the distance between them is based on a trade model developed by Krugman (1980). Further details about
the method and some applications can be found in Miller and Blair (2009).

     3. CLOSURE AND SIMULATIONS
     3.1 Model Closure
       Model closure is the determination of sets of endogenous and exogenous variables in simulations.
This closure represents hypotheses about the economy and its adjustments to shocks (policies). REGIA is
a dynamic model and allows for the accumulation of capital over time as well as adjustments to the land

   The division of this information between livestock and agriculture was taken in accordance with the lease of land values by
activity groups. For example, for agriculture, the rental values of the groups were combined, such as the temporary crop output,
horticulture and floriculture, permanent crops output, seeds, seedlings and other forms of plant propagation and forestry
production. For livestock, the rental values of the groups were also combined, such as livestock and keeping other animals,
fisheries and aquaculture. Because the model’s database comes from 2005, a deflator was applied to the monetary values of the
Agricultural Census to be equal to the input-output matrix. Thus, we obtained the national land remuneration for agriculture and
livestock. The last step was to divide the remuneration of land by region, given that the value of it is proportional to the production
of agriculture and livestock in each region.

market. The three closures used for the simulations are: i) historical closure, ii) baseline closure and iii)
policy closure.
         At first, there is a historical closure, from 2006 to 2011 to update macroeconomic variables
according to IBGE data. In this case, the main national aggregates are considered to be exogenous, such
as real GDP, investment, household consumption, government expenditure, exports and aggregate
employment. Thus, other variables, such as the gross rate of return, national wage, government demand,
exported volume, national propensity to consume, as well as technological change variable are
endogenous. In this case, the model calculates how these variables accommodate the national aggregates.
Another assumption is that regional areas for “natural forests and other uses” are exogenous to the
deforestation rates from 2006 to 2011 according to INPE data.
         At baseline from 2012 to 2030, the macroeconomic variables for the aggregate GDP, household
consumption and government expenditure are still exogenous and the regional deforestation rates become
endogenous. It is assumed that regional consumption follows the regional income and the government
expenditure follows the income of households regionally. Labor moves between regions and activities,
driven by real wages changes. The model works with relative prices, and the Consumer Price Index was
chosen as a numeraire. "Natural forests and other uses" is exogenous only for regions in the model that
do not comprise tropical forests and where the capacity for agricultural expansion through deforestation is
small. In REGIA, this group is formed by Sudeste Matogrossense, Centro-Sul Matogrossense, Sul
Maranhense, Leste Maranhense, Oriental de Tocantins and the rest of Brazil.
         In the policy scenario, each macroeconomic variable is endogenous, with the aggregate national
employment set exogenously. That is, aggregate employment is fixed relative to baseline, and labor can
move regionally. It is assumed that national consumption follows the GDP with endogenous national
propensity to consume. And the national total is distributed between regions in proportion to labor
income. The government expenditure follows the income of households regionally and nationally. A
restriction is imposed on the national balance of trade that determines its exogenous participation in the
national GDP, which does not restrict the possibilities of adjusting to the balance of trade for each region
individually.
     3.2 Simulations
         The baseline shows the 3% per year growth of the national economy for the period from 2012 to
2030 and represents the projection that is compared to the policy scenario19. Thus, real GDP, household
consumption and government expenditure are expected to grow at 3% per year, while population growth
is set at 1% per year. In addition to these variables, projections of soybean and cattle exports demand
were taken from Nassar (2011) consistent with FAO (2003)20 projections. The reason for using projection
of exports demand for soybeans and cattle is based on the fact that the export market for these products is
considered to be an important determinant of deforestation in the region. Soybean and cattle exports
demand were projected to increase by 4.25% and 2.01%, respectively, representing a total increase of
130% in soybean exports demand and 49% in cattle exports demand by 2030.
         The aim of the policy scenario is to represent the deforestation control policy proposed in the
PNMC (2008), projecting the impact of an 80% reduction in deforestation by 2020 and a 100% reduction
from 2021 to 2030, which means achieving zero deforestation in regions of the Brazilian Amazon. In
REGIA, the control of deforestation in the Amazon implies limiting the expansion of the land factor for
productive uses in agriculture. In general, the restriction on land supply will reduce the possibility of
converting natural forest areas into other productive uses, such as cropland, pasture and planted forest.
The initial impact of limit land supply is an increase in the remuneration of land with negative economic
impacts because of the rise in the production cost of agricultural goods. This will directly decrease the
activity level in the agricultural sector and indirectly decrease the activity level in other sectors.

  Brazil is modelled as a small open economy and the shock in the simulation was given in the variable “Export quantity
shift”.
                                                                                                          10



Moreover, limiting deforestation tend to engender more intense impacts on regions where the economy is
based more on agricultural activities.
        Another effect induced by the simulation is that a more expensive factor (land) encourages a shift
towards other primary factors (capital and labor). Even with the replacement from land to labor and
capital, there may be a reduction in employment and investment if the activity effect (declining output) is
stronger than the substitution effect (between land, labor and capital). The increase in prices of all goods
and the drop in employment levels may have the effect of reducing household consumption. Because the
model is interregional, restricting deforestation also reallocates output toward least affected areas. These
impacts are consistently designed by REGIA, which takes into account the regional interdependence. This
spillover effect of policies is an important feature of regional economies in Brazil.
        The reduction in land supply also has an effect on exports. The increase in the domestic prices of
goods in all regions makes the exported products relatively more expensive than imported goods. Hence,
the most affected regions are those where the economy is primarily aimed at agro-exported activities. In
summary, the net effect of the direct and indirect causalities will drive the impact on the activity level of
each region, and this effect is determined by the characteristics, as the regional trade integration and
production structures.
        Finally, the last simulation aims to identify the gains in land productivity that would offset the
adverse economic effects of the simulated policy of deforestation in the Amazon. The idea behind this
simulation is that economic agents or related public policies may respond to deforestation control by
modifying the agricultural techniques and livestock to mitigate the constraints imposed by controlling
deforestation.
   4. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
   4.1 Regional Macroeconomic Results
        The policy results presented here are reported as the cumulative percentage deviation (2012-2030)
relative to the baseline scenario. Table III presents the results for the major macroeconomic indicators by
region. In general, the impact of the policy to control deforestation does not seem to be excessive. The six
regions with major negative impacts on GDP were Norte Matogrossense (-3.6%), Nordeste
Matogrossense (-3%), Sudoeste Matogrossense (-2.1%), Marajó, Baixo Amazonas and Leste
Rondoniense (approximately - 1.7% each). Considering the Norte Matogrossense, for example, the
interpretation of these results is that this region would attain a cumulative growth 3.6% lower than that
obtained in a scenario without the policy (the baseline scenario).
        This greater impact on the Norte and Nordeste Matogrossense is explained in part because these
regions have the highest shares of land remuneration on GDP of the entire Amazon. Moreover,
agriculture accounts for over 50% of the total production in these regions. The decline in GDP in Norte
Matogrossense is a significant result because it is one of the largest regions in the Amazon and is
especially important in soybean and cattle production - two sectors directly affected by the policy. The
Sudeste Matogrossense, Baixo Amazonas and Leste Rondoniense regions are economies based on
agricultural activities, which represents over 50% of the total production in each of them, explaining the
negative impact.
        The silviculture and forestry activity accounts for more than 50% of all of the production in
Marajo, with another 30% distributed among agriculture sectors. This high share of agricultural
production and forestry makes this region one of the most affected by the policy. Also noteworthy is that
the decline in investment and household consumption were major drivers of the decrease in GDP in these
regions. The Leste Rondoniense also suffered a greater decline in GDP, which is a significant result
because the region is an important producer of cattle, accounting for over 13% of cattle in the Amazon.
        As expected, the regions that would be less affected by the policy are those that do not have areas
of natural forests to be converted into productive use. Some of these regions, such as Sul Maranhense,
Sudeste Matogrossense, Oriental de Tocantins and the rest of Brazil, even present a small gain in GDP
(0.35%, 0.20%, 0.12% and 0.06%, respectively). This result can be explained by the dynamics of the
                                                                                                                         11



labor and capital market. Employment will increase in regions less affected by the policy, which will then
lead to lower cost increases. Thus, these regions showed small gains in GDP due to interregional
migration causing a drop in real wages that then benefits the other regions.

        This simulated policy represents a direct increase in the costs of agricultural production - the main
economic activity of most regions in the Amazon also reduces exports. The increase in the production
costs that is passed on to the final prices of goods makes local production relatively more expensive than
the imported goods and discourages exports. Likewise, the effect of the drop in activity also reduces
imports. As the regions cannot convert more land into productive use, they seek to replace the land factor
with labor and capital. This suppresses the investment/capital ratio, promoting a decline in investment due
to low rates of return. Employment also decreases, which suggests that the activity effect (decrease in
GDP) is greater than the substitution effect (among the primary factors). The fall in employment leads to
a consequent reduction in household income and consumption, which is an indication that the policy
causes a loss of welfare.
    4.2 Sectoral Results
       The policy, as it restricts the possibilities of converting forests into productive agricultural use, has
a negative impact mainly on the agricultural sectors. Soybean production is important in the Amazon and
accounts for approximately 35% of national soybean production. Of all of the soybeans produced in the
                                                                                                            12



Amazon, nearly 60% are from the Norte Matogrossense, followed by Sudeste and Nordeste
Matogrossense, which together produce over 25% of the total soybeans. Soybean production is
considered to be one of the main drivers of deforestation, so the negative impact was expected. Figure 1
shows the impact of the policy on the soybean and cattle sectors.

            Control Deforestation (accumulated deviation from 2012 to 2030 relative to baseline)
                       Source: Elaborated by the authors based on simulation results from the REGIA model


        We note in Figure 1 that the number of regions in the database that present no impact are not
soybean producers or the soybean production is virtually zero. Both the Norte and Nordeste
Matogrossense are among the regions most affected by the policy. As expected, the Sudeste
Matogrossense would benefit from the policy because it lies outside its scope. In general, production
costs increase more in regions that are targets of the policy to control deforestation. This implies that in
regions where there are greater production costs impacts21, the drop in activity level will be greater as
well. In particular, soybean production is the sector with the greatest variations in production costs (one
of the most modern agriculture production in Brazil).
        Cattle production, one of the main drivers of deforestation, is also an important sector in the
Amazon and accounts for almost 30% of national production. Its production is concentrated in Leste
Rondoniense, Sudeste Paraense, Norte and Sudoeste Matogrossense. We can observe from Figure 2 that
the regions where cattle production is concentrated are among the most adversely affected by the policy.
Cattle activity is also considered to be an important driver of deforestation in the region but shows lower
cost increases than soybeans. This is because the remuneration of land in pasture areas is significantly
lower than in croplands in the Amazon.
        Table VI presents the sectoral results with an aggregation of the 27 sectors into 6 major industries.
Because of the free movement of goods and factors within the Brazilian economy, the region “rest of
Brazil” shows a positive impact in all industries. However, regions as Centro-Sul Matogrossense, Sul and
Leste Maranhense, Oriental and Ocidental of Tocantins, even if they do not have areas of natural forests
to be converted into productive use, presented a decline in production of many industries. This is because
of the strong commercial relationship between regions inside Amazon. And because of the linkage
between the sectors, Industries, Services and Public Administration Sectors present also a decline in its
production, even if they are not affected directly by the restriction of land. In general, the results suggest
that the largest sectoral negative impact occurs mainly on important agricultural regions such as Norte,
Nordeste and Sudeste Matogrossense, and Leste Rondoniense and on regions dominated by small family
farms such as Vale Acre and Baixo Amazonas.

   4.3 Land-Use Results
        Figure 2 shows the projection of land use in the Amazon in the policy to control deforestation
scenario. Given the reduction goal (limiting the land use), aggregate deforestation in the Amazon would
decline over time which means an avoided deforestation relative to the baseline. This can be seen in the
upward trend in the natural forest area, which is projected to increase to 14.56 million hectares in 2030
relative to the baseline scenario. Because the total area of the region is fixed, the growth of a particular
land use must be accompanied by a reduction in another land use. Thus, we note that reducing
deforestation is only possible by the reduction of cropland, pasture and planted forest relative to the
baseline. In this instance, a reduction in these areas means that in the economic growth scenario (baseline)
there would be less conversion of natural forests (deforestation) into these areas.
        Because land conversion as established in the REGIA assumes that areas of natural forest are first
converted into pasture, pasture areas would suffer the greatest reductions because of the limited growth of
land supply. Therefore, these areas would decrease by approximately nine million hectares compared to
the baseline scenario. Then, the crop areas and planted forest areas would present a decline in response to
the deforestation control policy. The first would have a reduction in area of about four million hectares,
while the planted forest areas would be reduced by about two million hectares in 2012-2030 relative to
the baseline scenario of economic growth.

        Table V presents the results for different types of land use (in millions of hectares) by region. The
policy increases the amount of land allocated for natural forest. Furthermore, we can note that the Norte
Matogrossense and Sudeste Paraense would be the regions with the largest preserved areas (in hectares).
Regarding the crop area, the regions with the greatest reductions in hectares would be Nordeste
Matogrossense, Nordeste Paraense, Baixo Amazonas and Vale do Acre. These regions have agricultural
goods/sectors in common as the most important activities in their production structures. In these regions,
the policy to control deforestation would cause a more severe drop in agricultural production, explaining
the greatest reduction in cropland.

       The pasture area in millions of hectares would be reduced more than the cropland area in most of
the Amazon regions. The explanation for this greater reduction in pasture lies in the fact that the model
assumes that the conversion of forest areas first occurs towards the pasture area. As such, the Sudeste and
Sudoeste Paraense, Norte and Nordeste Matogrossense, and Leste Rondoniense would have the largest
reductions in pasture area. This result is explained by the productive structure of these regions, which are

important producers of cattle in the Amazon. In general, we observe that regions with more natural forest
areas would be most affected by the policy to control deforestation and would show greater variation
(decline) in its areas for productive use as well as a greater increase in production costs.
        In terms of planted forest areas, it can be seen in Table IV that the reduction in these areas is of
less magnitude than it is for other uses. This result indicates that the increase in production costs for this
type of land is relatively smaller than for the others. However, we can highlight the reduction in planted
forest area in Sudeste Paraense and Baixo Amazonas. The Sudeste Paraense is the largest forestry
producer in the Amazon, and Baixo Amazonas also has a concentrated production in this sector.

         4.4 Land productivity response to policy
        In the simulations with the REGIA model, we have assumed that the policy to control
deforestation occurs during the period from 2012 to 2030. Thus, this section aim to show how land
productivity would have to increase in the same period to offset the impacts on regional outputs caused by
the limited supply of land. In the baseline scenario, it is assumed that the productivity of land increases by
1% per year from 2012 to 2030. There is also an increase in the overall productivity of the primary factors
of 0.7% per year in the same period. Therefore, the results reported in this section should be understood
as an additional increase in productivity considering the baseline scenario. Table VI presents the regional
results of the rise in productivity for the main agricultural sectors in the REGIA model that would offset
the negative impacts in the regions due to the deforestation policy.

       We notice, on average, that the annual productivity of the land should grow at approximately 1%
per year so that the policy to control deforestation would not cause any negative impact on production.
According Gasques et al. (2008), the productivity of land in Brazil grew by 3.26% per year from 2000 to
                                                                                                           16



2005, which suggests that this rate would be possible even in the Amazon. For example, to achieve the
given results, the land productivity gains would have to be 0.5% to 1.4% per year compared to the
baseline scenario to neutralize the effect of controlling deforestation. This would correspond to an
increase in productivity of approximately 2.2% to 3.1% per year, including the increased productivity per
year in the baseline scenario.

   5. CONCLUSIONS
        The main goal of this paper was to analyze the dynamics of land use and impacts of a policy to
control deforestation, seeking to contribute to an analysis of different scenarios in the Amazon. For this,
we built an interregional dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model called REGIA, which
incorporates a model of land use known as ILUC (indirect land-use change).
        First, a baseline scenario was built to project economic growth by region in a business-as-usual
situation without a policy to control deforestation. In this scenario, the Amazon regions are stimulated by
the growth of the national economy and the increasing demand to export soybeans and cattle. Related to
this scenario, we simulated a policy to control deforestation that aims to reduce deforestation by 80% by
2020, followed by a reduction target of 100% for the period from 2021 to 2030. The increase in land
productivity required to offset the negative impacts of the deforestation control policy was also projected.
Overall, the results indicated that the regions most affected by the policy follow two distinct patterns: i)
regions in the deforestation arc in Mato Grosso and Rondonia and ii) regions outside the arc that have a
smaller share in the total GDP of the Amazon, in Amazonas and Para. According to the data and
mechanisms of the model, the former are more negatively affected by having a higher remuneration of
land and being more productive. Thus restricting the supply of land would generate higher losses of
production per hectare. The regions outside of the arc have lower productivity, and often the growth of
their production is linked to the expansion of land (low remuneration), which then leads to the greater
negative impact in these regions.
        However, in general, the results showed that the costs of a policy to control deforestation in the
Amazon are relatively small, although its distribution is heterogeneous between regions, particularly
affecting the regions that are most dependent on agriculture and have low productivity. It was also
observed that the agriculture intensification in the Amazon can be considered to be a viable alternative for
the maintenance of the production, employment, income and consumption in the region.
        The results from simulated land productivity response suggest that the required annual gain would
be approximately 1.4% for cropland, 1.3% for pasture and 1.4% for planted forest. These results are in
addition to the increase in productivity for the land factor and the primary factors that is considered in the
baseline scenario, which is approximately 1.7% per year. The Amazon has a large cleared area that is
underutilized (IMAZON, 2013), and the productivity of land in Brazil grew by 3.26% per year, on
average, from 2000 to 2005 (GASQUES et al., 2008). Thus, the results of productivity gains found with
the REGIA model seem feasible and could be achieved through incentive policies targeting primary crops
and livestock in each region.
        According to other studies on this theme, the increased land productivity alone does not seem to
hold the expansion of crop areas. The increase in productivity can generate an incentive for producers to
add cultivated areas for further expansion of production. Thus, there must be a policy to control
deforestation coupled with increasing land productivity. Thus, the government should exercise greater
surveillance to curb illegal deforestation and, at the same time, promote economic incentives toward
forest conservation. These incentives can be provided with forest concessions for sustainable forest
management, payment for environmental services that highlight the payments of REDDs or even the
promotion of programs aimed to increase the productivity of deforested land in the Amazon.
        A limitation of the methodology employed in this paper is that the issue of proximity between
regions has no role in the expansion of agricultural crops or livestock. The model only allows for the
expansion of crops in regions where this production already exists in the database, and largely, only the
economic conditions of the region influence its expansion. That is, the model does not work properly with
                                                                                                            17



the issue of expansion of the agricultural frontier, but with the local expansion of activities influenced by
competitive market mechanisms. This is also due to the choice of the regional disaggregation of the
model.
