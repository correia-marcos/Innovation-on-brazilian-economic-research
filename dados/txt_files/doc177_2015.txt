This paper investigates open economy factors for precautionary and long run currency risk pricing.
It is shown that precautionary savings in foreign currency arises because of the volatility differential
between domestic and imported consumption growth. We present evidence that the variance of for-
eign consumption is much higher than the variance of domestic, durable and nondurable consumption
growth for the domestic USA resident. These open economy factors are also shown to be strongly
positively correlated with the USA business cycle (between 1967Q3 and 2012Q2). Estimation and
simulation results imply - through implied parameters and implied risk - that the open economy
model can explain the risk faced by a domestic USA resident with regards to Japan and the rest of
the world.

Introduction
    Standard Stochastic Discount Factors (SDFs), such as the growth of nondurable and durable
consumption, offer an incomplete motive for pricing a bond which pays monetary units in foreign
currency. This paper explores the traditional foreign and domestic consumption growth factors,
which follow from international trade theory, for precautionary and long run risk asset pricing2 .
    There are interesting economic interpretations for domestic and imported consumption growth
factors, as they are able to provide microeconomic foundations for buying a foreign bond: smoothing
out the consumption of imported goods. These factors are theoretically superior when compared to
the conventional durable/nondurable model, because precautionary savings in foreign currency arises
as a response to an increase in the variability of future consumption. They are able to rationalize
why a representative agent holds external wealth and how volatility in consumption and uncertainty
regarding exchange rates can impact on currency risk. The present paper focus on risk derived from
precautionary savings, i.e., risk due to changes in consumption growth variance. For this purpose,
it analyzes currency risk assuming different functional forms for the instantaneous utility functions
(power and habit) showing that consistent interpretations are possible when these new factors are
introduced.
    We show that open economy factors present a great sample variability when compared to aggregate
durable and nondurable growth. As will be revealed for the case of the United States of America
(USA), the variance of durable consumption growth is 44% higher than the variance of nondurable
growth from 1967Q3 to 2012Q2. And the variance of imported consumption growth is 133% higher
than the variance of durable consumer growth during the aforementioned period. Although our main
focus is on consumption growth variances, we also show that these factors are strongly positively
correlated to the USA business cycles, using both NBER recessions and the output gap as proxies.
Finally, our model estimations and calibrations imply reasonable values for the share of domestic
consumption goods (67%) and the parameter of risk aversion (9.69). It also implies reasonable levels
for steady state risk, considering the habit persistence model, which ranges from the extremes -2.31%
to 5.57% per quarter, but also reaches more modest numbers such as 0.31% per quarter, for instance.
In summary, there is evidence supporting the claim that highly variable imported consumption
growth, in addition to domestic growth, can be more appropriated stochastic discount factors for
currency risk pricing than the usual nondurable/durable model of consumption growth.
    This investigation is important for both researchers and policy makers. It is interesting to re-
searchers not only because it complements the asset pricing literature, but also because it lies at the
center of some of the most difficult unsolved puzzles in international macroeconomics, such as the
uncovered interest parity empirical failure. For policy makers, the answer is important to understand
the dynamics of real interest rates in an open economy, which is a vital issue for emerging countries
with high average real interest rates.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the currency risk
theory of asset pricing with domestic and imported consumption growth in the utility function.
This is accomplished by using a simple model under no default risk and no state contingent assets.
Section 3 explains the data sources and presents a descriptive and graphical analysis of the main
growth variables discussing key empirical results.
   2 Earlier theoretical models have been explaining currency pricing using durable and non-durable consumption

growth factors (see, for instance, Lustig & Verdelhan (2007)). Although, our monetary asset pricing model is based
on the theoretical contribution of Ferreira & Moore (2015), the paper’s approach is different in various and important
ways. For instance, Ferreira & Moore (2015) completely focuses on estimating covariances between SDFs and excess
returns in a log-linear factor model, whereas the present paper abstracts from covariances and focuses on precautionary
and long run risks.

1     Currency Risk Theory
     Consider two open economies, the “H-country” (H for home) and the “F-country” (F for foreign),
populated by a representative household3 . The period utility function of the representative agent in
the home country is represented by u(Cyt ,Cy∗t )4 . It follows that a domestic representative household
can choose her optimal consumption allocation path deciding how much to buy of home and foreign
goods as well as, from an inter-temporal dimension, deciding how much to hold of domestic and
foreign bonds. Hence, the representative household in the domestic economy chooses to consume Cyt
units of the home produced good and Cy∗t of the foreign produced good. Unless otherwise stated,
foreign variables will be represented by an asterisk.
     At the beginning of each period, indicated by the t subscript, the family receives an endowment,
Yt , in domestic currency and another, Yt∗ , in foreign currency. The state variables are the quantities
Bt of domestic bonds and Bt∗ of foreign bonds, each one paying one unit of its respective currency at
t + 1. IEt is the expectation conditional on all information available at t.
     The problem of the representative agent is then

benefit of the real consumption at t + 1 discounted for period t. The cost of the home bond is PtB ,
which represents the nominal price of a zero-coupon discount bond that pays with certainty one unit
of the domestic currency at t + 1. An analogous definition applies for the foreign bond.
    We will later analyze currency risk premium under both a power utility specification5 and a
habit based explanation. For the latter reason, we will compare our theoretical results with the ones
from the papers of Verdelhan (2010) and Moore & Roche (2010) which are both based on the work
of Campbell & Cochrane (1999). We will also discuss the implication of their empirical results on
the light of the theory that is derived under these optimization conditions. Moore & Roche (2010)
present a detailed monetary model following the two-country, two-good model framework of Lucas
(1982) while Verdelhan (2010)’s simpler structure consider only a real economy - both under a habit
consumption explanation. As the Euler equations above can be largely simplified by considering that
some of the partial derivatives are equal, it becomes important to mention that the model presented
in Verdelhan (2010) will appear as a special case of the one that is developed here.
    Given the assumptions regarding bond prices, more specifically, given that the riskless bond pays
one unit with certainty at time t + 1 of the corresponding issuer-country currency, one can also write

inflation between t and t + 1, the unknown variable for the expected real return at t + 1 evaluated at
time t. By doing this, we are focusing on risk (uncertainty regarding future marginal utility) derived
from consumption growth variance and not on risk due to the covariance between excess returns and

Suppose that the H-country is the UK and the F-economy is the USA, for example. In addition, consider that the home
representative agent borrows funds in the USA to buy bonds in UK, for instance. It follows that the expected excess
return for this investor corresponds to the expected real return on the British bond minus the real cost of borrowing

domestic household is the volatility of each of the SDFs which are closely related to the variance of
H and F consumption growth shocks (i.e. overall consumption variance).
    By observing that the SDFs are related to how agents feel regarding the consumption of both H
and F goods, the economic interpretation of the previous equations becomes straightforward. SDFs
will depend on the exogenously given consumption growth but will determine endogenously obtained
bond prices. Hence, if the variance of the F-good’s consumption is relatively higher than the variance
of the H-good’s consumption, ceteris paribus, domestic households will buy more of the foreign bond

more valuable since it insures the H-household against overall consumption fluctuations and, by
consequence, marginal utility variations arising from higher F-good’s consumption variance. This can
be interpreted as precautionary savings in foreign currency because consumption growth variance is
the unique force driving attitudes towards risk. The price of the F-bond in period t is thus higher
than the H-bond when both assets are expressed in the same currency. As a consequence, the ex
ante return on the F-bond is relatively lower, which explain an expected currency premium on the
H-bond. In the next sub-sections, we assume specific functional forms for the period utility function
and derive these relationships directly.

     As can be seen above, IEt (Mt+1) will be negatively correlated to the mean value of domestic
consumption growth if γ > − 1−θ    θ , which is the case for risk averse agents. In that case, it will
also be positively correlated to the variance of consumption of both domestic and foreign goods
as marginal utility depends on both types of goods (that is, overall consumption). The economic
interpretation is that, the higher overall consumption volatility is, the higher bond prices are (as
households will demand more of both bonds for precautionary motives), and the smaller their return.
If θ ≈ 1, for instance, an increase in the volatility of the home produced good will affect the SDF,
IEt (Mt+1 ), increasing PtB and reducing the H-bond return (and σ2ut+1 ∗ will have no effect on PtB ).
For that reason, an increase in the volatility of the domestic good consumption will decrease the
expected currency risk when θ ≈ 1. The expected currency risk, on the other hand will increase with
the volatility of the domestic consumption of the foreign produced good, everything else remaining
equal, even when θ ≈ 1 (and nearly nothing of the F-good is consumed) because the foreign bond
will be more demanded.

The expected currency risk will thus be equal to

   Currency Risk, Domestic and Imported Consumption

   Let us analyze the excess return from the perspective of the F-household. First, note that the
  9 H-goods  consumption growth can be understood in a two country world as F-economy imports of H-goods for
internal consumption.



                                                             6
expected currency risk will be deterministic and a function of the model parameters and the variance
of consumption shocks for H and F goods.
    A numerical example can help understand the nature of the risk facing the F-agent. Suppose
θF = 0.9 and γF = 2. It follows that IEt (ρt+1c ) > 0 whenever σ2 > 3 σ2 . When the proportion of
                                                                    uF   7 uF∗
F-goods in the overall consumption of the F-household is very high, most of the shocks perturbing the
overall consumption stream arise from F-goods consumption, so there is no need for the F-household
to insure against H-goods shocks by buying too many of the H-bonds. It follows that H-bond prices
will be relatively smaller than F-bonds, ceteris paribus, and returns on the H-bond will be higher.
Thus, currency risk (as we defined) will be positive when F-households consume few goods from the
H-economy, even if the variance of F-consumption is very small, relative to the H-consumption.
    Also, note that the local coefficient of risk aversion or local curvature of the utility function is γF .
It is interesting to note that

    Equation (24) shows that for a infinitesimal change in the local curvature parameter of the F-
household utility function, the variation in currency risk will positively depend on the variance of
F-goods consumption growth shocks and negatively on the H-goods consumption variance. It will
also depend on the proportion of home and foreign goods on total consumption. For example,
suppose that the proportions of F and H produced goods on total F-consumption are the same, that
is θF = 21 , then the effect is positive if σ2uF > σ2uF∗ . This ceteris paribus partial effect means that as
agents become more risk averse, they give more importance to smoothing the consumption of the
good that is more volatile, in that case, the F-good (demanding less of the H bonds, decreasing their
price and increasing ex ante returns). Intuitively, if θF = 21 and variances are the same, the impact of
an increase in the local curvature parameter is null. Finally, note that equations (22) and (23) must
be equal with complete markets in optimizing equilibrium. This implies some consistency conditions
for the model parameters and also for the variance of individual shocks. For example, consider for
simplicity that γ = γF = 2 and θ = θF = 12 . The consistency condition will be

                                          σ2u∗ − σ2u = σ2uF − σ2uF∗ .
    For instance if risk premium is positive σ2u∗ > σ2u , as higher F-good consumption volatility induces
H-agents to buy more of the F-bond. It must also be the case that the volatility of the F-goods
consumption in the F country should also be higher to induce F-agents to buy relatively more
of the F-bond (and prices will be higher and their ex ante return lower). There is no market
clearing condition in this simple asset pricing model that will entail the condition above - recall that
variances are exogenously given. It is beyond the objective of the present paper to model these
market relationships as well as the underlying origin of such shocks and their propagation.

where g is the deterministic part of the growth of overall consumption in the H-economy, g = θgy +
(1 − θ)gy∗ ; λ(xt ) is the sensitivity function which determines the behavior of the surplus consumption
ratio.
    One way to interpret (27) is through the analysis of the consumption growth variances in (26).
First, currency risk would be equal to zero in equation (26) above if σ2ε∗ = σ2ε , as H-agents would
be indifferent between holding H or F bonds. In order to understand this assertion, notice that the
equality σ2ε∗ = σ2ε , implies

                          [1 + 2γ(1 − θ)(1 + λ(xt ))]σ2u∗ = [1 + 2γθ(1 + λ(xt ))]σ2u .
    The “non-trivial” cases in which the equality above hold occurs when θ = 12 and σ2u = σ2u∗ . It
follows that, the composite of H and F shocks are such that they disturb the H consumption stream
in the same way, thus domestic agents perceive both H and F bonds as being perfect substitutes.
    In order to interpret equation (26), consider that the consumption surplus is above steady state,

xt − x̄ > 12 , so that the local risk aversion is relatively low10 . In that case, currency risk will be positive
only if σ2ε∗ > σ2ε which will happen when

                                 [1 + 2γ(1 − θ)(1 + λ(xt ))]σ2u∗ > [1 + 2γθ(1 + λ(xt ))]σ2u .
    For ease of exhibition, consider that θ = 12 . The inequality above will hold if σ2u∗ > σ2u . The
economic explanation is that, since shocks to the consumption of F-goods dominate the volatility
of H-household overall consumption, risk averse agents will buy relatively more of the F-bond in
order to be insured against that stronger source of utility fluctuation. It follows that the price of
the F-bond will be higher than the H-bond, when both are denominated in the same currency, and
hence real returns on the H-bond will be higher ex ante 11 . A similar explanation can also be done
for the currency risk faced by the F-agent. Also, the condition that the risk expressions will be the
same for both the H and F agent will hold for consistency reasons, as in the power utility case.

1.4.1        Currency Risk and Uncovered Interest Parity
    The previous model also offer an explanation for the Uncovered Interest Parity puzzle: i.e.,
the strong theoretical foundations and poor empirical support. As previously mentioned, there is
no distinction between the consumption of H and F goods in the model developed in Verdelhan
(2010). It follows that ex ante currency risk from the perspective of the domestic agent will be a
positive function of the consumption surplus differential, st∗ − st 12 . Ceteris paribus, a positive surplus
differential implies that times are relatively bad at home so that the agent feels relatively more
risk averse, given that the set of parameters governing the domestic and foreign sensitivity function
are the same. In that case, excess returns on the foreign bond will be positive ex ante since the
domestic agent will have to be compensated by hers relatively higher risk aversion. It also follows
that, everything else remaining constant, an increase in domestic consumption variance will have a
positive effect on the expected excess returns to be obtained from the foreign bond (which is intuitive,
since demand for foreign bonds should increase less than for domestic bonds). Finally, it must be
stressed that systematic (persistent) positive currency risk premiums on emerging markets bonds
would exist, for instance, only if the USA agents were relatively more in bad times, which is a strong
hypothesis.
    However, the aim of Verdelhan (2010)’s paper is to examine the motives behind the Uncovered
Interest Parity failure under the habit formation set up and in a non-monetary structure (all variables
are real). In his model, a) expected exchange rates are a function of both the real interest rate
differentials and the variance of the SFDs13 and b) risk free real interest rates in both countries
will also be related to their respective SDFs. The solution to this system of equations will result in
a reduced form model for the expected real exchange rate changes in which the coefficient on the
real interest rate differential is not going to be exactly equal to one. In fact, the coefficient will be
equal to one only in the trivial cases in which either γ = 0, so there is no risk aversion, or if the
standard deviation of consumption shocks is null, σ = 0, i.e. there is no source of risk to be insured

                        t t+1 ) > IEt (rt+1 ) and that expected real depreciation is zero, i.e. IEt (Qt+1 ) = Qt and St+1 = 1. It

price of the F bond in H monetary units. If one considers that IEt (St+1 ) = 1, so both bonds are expected to pay one
unit of the same currency at t + 1, then the real expected return will be higher for the H bond only if the F-bond price
denominated in H currency is higher, i.e. PtB∗ St > PtB .

expected real exchange rate changes minus the domestic rate and note, also, that the asterisk represent the foreign
economy in his model.

from. A regression of the interest differential on the expected real exchange rate changes would not
result in a unit coefficient unless one controls for ex ante currency risk - otherwise there will be an
omitted variable (and consequent negative bias) that can be emulated from the model by proper
parameterization.
    In Moore & Roche (2010)’s model, a representative household decides how much to allocate
between consumption (of home and foreign goods) and portfolio, given the existence of subsistence
consumption and state contingent bonds. From the model’s Euler equations, they obtain expressions
for the real exchange rate and for the risk-free bond prices in both home and foreign currency. The
real exchange rate that results from the model is a function of exogenously given: endowments, the
surplus consumption ratio and the local curvature of the utility function. The bond-price also depends
on the subjective inter-temporal discount factor and on the inflation of the respective country. The
cash-in-advance constraint is further used to obtain, from the real exchange rate equation, a nominal
exchange rate that is a function of exogenous relative money supplies instead of endogenous prices.
After assuming that endowment growth and money growth are AR(1) processes, Moore & Roche
(2010) calculate the variances of the terms of trade and nominal exchange rates. If the surplus
consumption ratio is very persistent, its variance will be large and it will dominate the variance of
the two other variables mentioned above. The assumption of a long memory process for consumption
growth then offers an explanation for the exchange rate disconnect puzzle as in Meese & Rogoff
(1983). Exchange rate forecasts will be inaccurate as long as the surplus consumption ratio is not
accounted for in the estimations. The forward bias puzzle can arise in Moore & Roche (2010) from
the same reason that was explained in Verdelhan (2010): the reduced form equation for nominal
exchange changes will not necessarily have a unit coefficient on nominal interest rate differentials.
Moore & Roche (2010) thus proceed by showing how the conditions for a negative coefficient can
arise from the model equations.
    As both domestic and imported growth variances were shown to be important for the theoretical
and empirical understanding of currency risk, we present a detailed analysis of USA consumption
growth data in the next section. Section 3 shows how the variance of imported consumption growth
compares to the variance of domestic, nondurable and durable growth in the USA and how it relates,
dynamically, to excess returns.


2      Empirics
    A natural question which arises from the theory put forward in the first section regards its em-
pirical suitability. After all, are open economy factors empirically relevant for currency risk pricing?
This question will be answered in three parts. First, by means of a descriptive analysis of the second
moment of the disaggregated USA consumption growth series, we will show that they are (at least) no
less volatile than durable consumption growth. Second, we will reveal that these factors positively
co-vary with respect to proxies for the USA business cycle and, third, we will provide supportive
evidence that open economy factors are able to explain currency risk using simulations.
    Our sample spans from 1950Q1 to 2012Q4 with the exception of the imported consumption (be-
ginning in 1967Q1). Variables were constructed following the methodology of Yogo (2006) using USA
consumption data from the Department of Commerce of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
“Nondurable consumption” was built using the Fisher index which corresponds to the geometric mean
of the Laspeyres and Paasche for nondurable and consumption services14 . The base year (equal to
100) is 2009, which, due to the construction of the series, generates a small difference with the quar-
terly growth rate series from Yogo (2006). The first quarter of 1950 was adopted as the initial capital
stock for durable consumption. We assumed a value equal to the per capita stock of capital of the
  14 Forsimplicity, we used the term “nondurable” for this variable. However, it is important to notice that it also
comprises the consumption of services.



                                                        10
year 1951, which is US$ 1,636.00 in 2009 prices15 . The remainder of the series of durable goods was
constructed according to the perpetual inventory method using a depreciation rate equal to 6% per
quarter, an arbitrary value that is common in this literature.
    The series of imported goods have some additional limitations. First, despite the prices of im-
ported goods are available since 1950 or 1960, data on imported consumer spending begins only on
1967Q1. Secondly, it must be emphasized that imported consumption of both durable and nondurable
goods excludes imports of automotive goods already in the original sources.
    The initial capital stock for the series of imported durable goods was chosen arbitrarily to minimize
the variance of the growth rate of the first thirty observations, which led to a value of US$ 684.3 for
1966Q3, in 2009 prices. This choice was subjective, but it is based on the fact that (1 − δ) becomes
small after 30 periods, reaching approximately the value of 0.156 when δ = 6%. That is, after thirty
periods, the share of the initial capital stock in the total stock is reduced to 15.6%, making its
importance relatively small16 . The other variables were constructed following the same methodology
adopted for the construction of the durable and nondurable consumption series as explained above.
    The aggregation of nondurable, durable and services in total imports was also performed through
a Fisher index. It is important to emphasize that we adopted the estimated value of US$ 2,326.00 in
1966Q4 for the initial capital stock of domestic durables, using data from BEA of the total durables
in 1965. Domestic consumption series are constructed by subtracting the flows of imports from total
consumption.

Descriptive Statistics
    Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics for these consumption series. The average growth
rate of durables is 91.3% higher than the average of the nondurables. Table 1 shows that the average
growth rate of imported goods is 84% higher than the growth rate of consumer durables17 . But it is
worth noting that the share of imported goods is a small fraction of total consumption, even at the
end of the sample period18 . It can also be seen in Table 1 that imported durable goods present the
highest growth rate, reaching an average value of 1.64% per quarter.
    Table 1 shows that the variance of durable goods consumption is 44% larger than the variance
of the consumption of nondurables. The variance of domestic consumption growth is close to the
nondurables, 0.21 and 0.25, respectively. Finally, the variance of imported consumption is 133.3%
greater than the consumption growth of durables and 236% greater than the consumption growth
of nondurable goods. These quantitative differences remain in sub-samples. The most volatile com-
ponent of imports is nondurable consumption growth, reaching a variance 19.36 times bigger than
the durable ones. But it must be emphasized that the relative weight of this component is small:
between 1967Q2 and 2012Q2, the average nondurable imported consumer spending represents 8.7%
of the durable (also worth remembering that the automotive consumption data, which are essentially
durable, are not computed).
    The last two rows of Table 1 show that the statistics of the series constructed by Yogo (2006) for
durable and nondurable and the ones used in this paper are similar, which is not a surprise as the
same methodology was used. The assumption of normality of the series is strongly rejected for the
entire period and for the period starting in 1973Q2. This is possibly due to the presence of extreme
  15 Calculated   using the variable USA net stock of fixed assets - consumer durable goods and USA price chain -type
index for pce, durable goods sadj, with the mnemonic USNSCDCA - annual series, in billions of dollars, without
adjustment, end of period, whose availability was from 1950 to 2011.
  16 Choosing the initial capital stock to minimize the variance of the series ensures that we are not assuming a very

high or very low initial value, as implied by the perpetual inventory model.
  17 It is implicitly assumed in the utility function that households consume the services of durable goods proportionally

to the stock and that the factor of proportion is equal to one.
  18 In 2013Q1, the share of imported stock ofr consumption durables in total stock of durable consumption reached

23.76%, while the nondurable was 9.43% of the total consumption of nondurables.

2.1     Consumption Factors and USA Business Cycles
    The possibility of predicting stock market returns and asset prices using variables correlated with
the business cycle is known [for an interesting summary of this evidence, see Nobel Prize Committee
(2013)]. Thus, the risk premium increases as the economy moves toward the valley and decreases
when it is going towards the peak. Asset pricing models such as the canonical Consumption Capital
Asset Pricing Model fail to explain this countercyclical evidence both for the market and currency
risk premium, mostly because there is not much variability in the aggregate consumption series. For
this reason. disaggregated data on nondurable and durable consumption have been used in applied
work (see Lustig & Verdelhan (2007)).
    Yogo (2006) notes that the consumption of non-durable goods has lower volatility compared to
stock returns, low autocorrelation, low correlation with the cycle. Yogo (2006) also shows that a pro-
cyclical relationship can be observed with nondurable growth. Figure 1 presents “closed economy”
consumption factors USA NBER recessions highlighted in the shaded areas. Comparison of our data
with Yogo (2006), which is represented by the dotted lines in the graph, show that results presented
in this paper are not drive by any particular feature of our sample. Figure 3 plots USA NBER
recessions highlighted in the shaded areas and the growth of consumption factors against the output
gap. As can be seen, open economy (domestic and imported consumption growth) seem to be “highly”
pro-cyclical.
    In order to formally evaluate the cyclical properties of these factors, we also ran the following
regressions

                                                  ∆c jt = τ1 + ω j DNBER + µ1t ,                                                   (28)

                                                  ∆c jt = τ2 + γ j (yt − y¯t ) + µ2t ,                                             (29)
where ∆c jt refers to the consumption growth of either nondurable ( ∆cnt ), durable ( ∆cdt ), domestic
( ∆cyt )or imported goods ( ∆cy∗t ), i.e., j = n, d, y, y∗; µ1t and µ2t are Gaussian error terms, DNBER
is a dummy variable which receives a value equal to one during USA NBER recessions and zero
otherwise, yt is an index of real USA gross domestic product and y¯t is the corresponding smoothed
variable (through a Hodrick-Prescott filter) - in other words, yt − y¯t stands for a proxy of the output
gap.

   Table 2 presents these results. As can be seen, the estimated impacts of a recession on imported
and durable growth are both significant at high confidence levels. However, a quarter of recession
has a much bigger impact on the growth of imported consumption goods than to durable growth.
Second part of 2 shows that durable, domestic and imported consumption factors are positively

correlated with the cycle (an increase in the output gap in associated with a rise in consumption).
Stronger statistical correlations, as implied by the point estimates and corresponding t-statistics, are
for durable and imported consumption growth.

2.2    Long run and Habit Risks: estimation and calibration
    We present two sets of results in this sub-section. The first relates to the estimation of the
parameters that belong to the long run risk model, based on power utility in (25). For this purpose,
we use data on currency excess returns. The second set relates to the implied steady state risk
premium in the habit model, which is calibrated using parameters borrowed from Verdelhan (2010),
Campbell & Cochrane (1999) and Wachter (2006), as shown later.
    Firstly, it must be noted that our series of excess returns was constructed according to the
following formula
                            nh                                         i           o
                        je          j      j/US$    j/US$
                      Rt+k ≡ (1 + it.k ) St      /St+k      − (1 + it.k ) (Pt /Pt+k ) ,         (30)
       ∗ is the interest rate on a bond from the F economy, purchased at t with t + k maturity; P
where it.k                                                                                       t
                       j/US$
is the USA CPI and St         is the exchange rate of the F economy, denominated as the country’s F
                             je
price of the USA dollar. Rt+k is the ex post excess real return obtained from buying a bond from
country F with respect to the USA return, considering that they are both purchased at t, with the
same maturity, t + k . We decided to use Japan as the foreign economy, since our sample data starts
from 1967Q3 and Japan was the largest economy with data available since then.
    We estimated ϕ0 , ϕ1 , ϕ∗0 and ϕ∗1 parameters via OLS, through an autoregressive (of order 1-
AR(1)) model of the consumption growth variance. The first observation was obtained by taking
the average of the last four quarters in a rolling manner. Figure 3 presents the time-varying growth
variances and NBER recessions in the shaded areas. As can be seen, there appears to be a large
increase in the imported growth variance in the second of the seventies’ recession and a negative
trend that followed, with no apparent regular episodes of ups and downs during the following cycles.

                                                       14
Domestic growth variance, on the other hand, seems to grow faster during NBER recessions. We then
estimated (25) using excess returns on Japanese bonds obtained according to (30) and using IMF data
(for the same time span of domestic and imported consumption growth). During the sample period,
Japan presented a negative average excess return of -1.01 with a standard error equal to 3.17. Results
are presented in Table 3 and 4. Two findings are worth noting, in particular. First, the implied share
of consumption of domestic goods is 67%, which seems to be a reasonable value. Second, the implied
coefficient of risk aversion is 9.69, which is considerably lower than what is suggested by the Mehra
& Prescott (1985) puzzle, but much higher than what is thought to be a reasonable value - and that
is also used for calibration purposes. Finally, Table 5 present simulation results of the implied steady
state risk premium using the Habit Persistence Model. As can be seen, using parameters borrowed
from Verdelhan (2010), Campbell & Cochrane (1999) and Wachter (2006), and different values for θ,
we found that currency risk, from the perspective of a North American resident investing on Japanese
bonds, ranges from the extremes -2.31% to 5.57% per quarter, but also reaches more modest values,
such as 0.31% per quarter, for instance.

3    Concluding Remarks
    This paper shows that there is a strong theoretical reason for keeping precautionary savings in
foreign currency when foreign consumption matters for the utility of the representative agent. In an
open economy, an increase in the volatility of imported consumption goods, keeping everything else
constant, increases currency risk premium because it makes foreign bonds relatively more valuable
than domestic ones. In regards to the correlation between consumption factors and cycles, the paper
presents some evidence that domestic and imported consumption growth are highly correlated with
the USA NBER recessions and a proxy for the business cycle. Our model estimations and calibrations
imply reasonable values for the share of domestic consumption goods (67%) and the parameter of
risk aversion (9.69). It also implies reasonable levels for steady state risk, considering the habit
persistence model, which ranges from the extremes -2.31% to 5.57% per quarter, but also reaches
more modest values, 0.31% per quarter, for instance. In summary, there is evidence supporting the
claim that highly variable imported consumption growth, in addition to domestic growth, can be more
appropriated stochastic discount factors for currency risk pricing than the usual nondurable/durable
model of consumption growth.

Appendix: Habit Formation Model
   Following Moore & Roche (2010), we consider habits that are defined over types of goods

where Ht is the subsistence consumption (or habits) of goods country H.
   As already shown, the relation between habit and consumption is conveniently captured by the
surplus consumption ratio, Xt , following Campbell & Cochrane (1999) and defined as below

the equivalent of equations (18) and (19) can now be written as

   Following Campbell & Cochrane (1999), we also assume that the dynamics of the log surplus
consumption rate, xt+1 , evolves according to an AR(1) process with non-linear properties due to the
function that governs the consumption shocks
