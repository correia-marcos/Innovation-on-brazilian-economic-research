This paper analyzes the effect of the banking market structure on countries’ financial
development. For this purpose, we use a dynamic panel with annual data, from 2006 to 2015,
comprising 89 countries - 28 developed and 61 emerging. The structure of the banking market
is measured with concentration (total assets of the largest banks in relation to total assets) and
competition (Lerner and Boone indexes) metrics. As proxies for measuring financial
development, we use the index developed by Sahay et al. (2015) and Svirydzenka (2016), which
covers depth, access and efficiency aspects of the financial system. Moreover, domestic credit
provided by the financial sector as a percentage of gross domestic product, a long-stablished
proxy for financial development, is used. The main results indicate that an increase in bank
concentration leads to a reduction in the country’s financial development, and that an increase
in competition leads to an increase in financial development. In short, an improvement in
banking market structure (a decrease in concentration or an increase in competition) is relevant
to financial development. This result is also verified for emerging countries.

Este artigo analisa o efeito da estrutura do mercado bancário no desenvolvimento financeiro
dos países. Para isso, utilizamos um painel dinâmico com dados anuais, de 2006 a 2015,
composto por 89 países - 28 desenvolvidos e 61 emergentes. A estrutura do mercado bancário
é medida com base em indicadores de concentração (ativos totais dos maiores bancos em
relação ao total de ativos) e competição (índices de Lerner e Boone). Como proxies para medir
o desenvolvimento financeiro, usamos o índice desenvolvido por Sahay et al. (2015) e
Svirydzenka (2016), que abrange aspectos de profundidade, acesso e eficiência do sistema
financeiro. Além disso, é utilizado o crédito interno fornecido pelo setor financeiro como
porcentagem do produto interno bruto, uma proxy estabelecida há muito tempo para o
desenvolvimento financeiro. Os principais resultados indicam que um aumento na concentração
dos bancos leva a uma redução no desenvolvimento financeiro do país e que um aumento na
competição leva a um aumento no desenvolvimento financeiro. Em resumo, uma melhoria na
estrutura do mercado bancário (uma diminuição na concentração ou um aumento na
competição) é relevante para o desenvolvimento financeiro. Esse resultado também é verificado
para países emergentes.

1. Introduction

        This paper investigates the simultaneous effects of banking concentration and
competition, herein denominated banking market structure, on countries’ financial
development. Using a dynamic panel of 89 countries - 28 developed and 61 emerging - with
annual data over the period 2006-2015, our results suggest that banking market structure affects
the level of countries’ financial development. In particular, an increase in bank concentration
leads to a reduction of financial development. On the other hand, an increase in competition
amplifies financial development. Moreover, we identify that an improvement in banking market
structure (a decrease in concentration or an increase in competition) is also relevant for the
financial development of emerging economies.
       The works that investigate the relevance of financial development, since Beck et al.
(2000) and Levine (2003), find a positive relationship between financial development and
economic growth. Recently, studies involving income distribution and financial development
were embodied to the literature (Adu et al., 2013; Herwartz and Walle, 2014; Beck et al., 2014;
Khoutem et al., 2014; Law and Singh, 2016; Durusu-Ciftci et al., 2016; and Azofra et al., 2018).
At present, a novel branch of the literature studies the relationship between financial
development and bank behavior (Sahay et al., 2015 and Svirydzenka, 2016). Therefore,
understanding the relationship between banking market structure and financial development is
fundamental to expand the knowledge about the determinants of financial development.
        The main issue of banking market structure is about market power problems. However,
literature presents mixed empirical evidence of the relationship between competition and
stability. From the competition-fragility view, as Kasman and Kasman (2015) point out,
decreases in market power and profit margins, encouraging additional risk-taking, pose a threat
to financial stability. Conversely, the competition-stability view holds that less banking market
power drives the cost of credit down, reducing loan default rates, which benefits banking
stability (Fungácová, et al., 2017).
        From the effects of banking concentration standpoint, Fu et al. (2014) argue that greater
concentration fosters financial fragility, considering cross-country data from Asia pacific
countries. On the one hand, Ben Ali, Intissar and Zeitun (2015) argue that concentration has a
positive impact on financial stability through the profitability channel. Regarding the effects of
banking competition, Amidu and Wolfe (2013) assert that competition enhances financial
stability in developing countries, as long as income generating activities increase, for it is
identified as a channel through which competition affects banking insolvency risk. Consistent
with this argument, Beck (2008) suggests that competition is not detrimental to banking system
stability in a market-based financial system with the necessary supporting institutional
framework and proper policies.
       The controversy between concentration and competition can be also present in the way
banking market structure affects financial service offers. Cetorelli and Gambera (2001) find
evidence that banking concentration supports the growth of industrial sectors that need external
financing, making it easier for young companies to access credit. Bara, et al. (2017) find that a
reduction in banking concentration, as well as an increase in competition, stimulates growth.
        Although a concentrated banking sector can reduce competition through barriers to new
entrants (which could expand financial services offer), it is also true that a concentrated banking
sector can be competitive (Vives, 2016). In order to avoid the controversy, our paper chooses
to look into a comprehensive approach of the relationship between concentration and
competition, which we refer as banking market structure, and financial development. Moreover,
as the lack of financial development is a problem for emerging economies (Seven and Coskun,

2016), we provide a specific analysis of the effects of concentration and competition on
developing countries' financial development.
       The article is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the data and discuss our
empirical methodology. Section 3 presents our main results and section 4 draws the conclusion.


2. Data and Methodology

       The present work makes use of annual data from 2006 to 2015, according to data
availability, in an unbalanced dynamic panel with 89 countries. The sample used to investigate
the effect of banking market structure on financial development consists of 28 developed
countries and 61 developing countries, which are reported in the appendix (table A1). All data
were extracted from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank websites and the
description of each variable associated with their respective source is detailed in table A2 in the
appendix.
        The financial development measure used in this study is the financial institutions index
(FI) developed by Sahay et al. (2015) and Svirydzenka (2016), which reflects three dimensions
of financial development: depth, access and efficiency. The second measure used in this study
is the domestic credit provided by the financial sector as a percentage of GDP (CRED_GDP),
a long-stablished proxy for financial development commonly used in the literature (Beck et al.,
2000; Beck and Levine 2004).
         According to Seven and Coskun (2016), financial development presents complex
institutional and political dimensions. Therefore, the influence of banking concentration, as
well as competition, on financial development could be different depending on country
characteristics. This reasoning provides the motivation for a second analysis, which highlights
the effects of banking market structure on the financial development of developing countries.
Accordingly, the average financial development (FI) in developed countries is higher than in
developing ones, as the descriptive statistics across the samples analyzed shown in Table 1
reveal.

        As stated by Berger et al. (2004), the consolidation of banks around the world intensified
the debate about the effects of concentration and competition on banks' performance. In
accordance with this argument, this study used two variations of the largest banks’ total assets
as measures of banking concentration. Following Kasman and Kasman (2015), the first measure
aggregates the assets of the five largest banks (Bank_5), while the second measure, derived
from Fu et al. (2014), aggregates the assets of the three largest banks in relation to the total
assets of commercial banks (Bank_3). Regarding competition measures, this study resorts to
measures often used in the literature, such as the Lerner and Boone indexes. The Lerner index
is a measure of "market power" (Demirgüç-Kunt and Martínez Pería, 2010). Hence, the greater
                                                                                               4



the "market power", the lower the competition. The Boone index measures the degree of
banking competition from the elasticity of profits to marginal costs, as Kasman and Kasman
(2015) point out. The reasoning that underpins the indicators is that higher profits are achieved
by more efficient banks. Therefore, an increase in the Boone and Lerner indexes reflects a
hindrance to financial intermediaries’ competition.
        In order to control the effect of banking concentration and competition on financial
development, we used banking and macroeconomic variables. For that, we followed Kasman
and Kasman (2015) and used the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to capture the relation
between credit risk and financial development. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is used to
capture the trade-off between financial stability and financial development. CAR is an
international standard that measures a bank’s risk of insolvency from excessive losses and
equals the equity divided by the risk-weighted assets (De Moraes, Antunes and Montes, 2016).
From financial development literature, the following macroeconomic variables are used: real
interest rate (INTR), Bara et al. (2017) use this variable as control in a model whose dependent
variable is financial development; annual GDP growth rate (GDP) based on constant local
currency (Raza et al., 2014) and, concordantly with Chinn, Menzie and Ito (2006) the inflation
rate (INFL). Descriptive statistics of variables used are reported below, in Table 2. Finally, to
capture the effects of the subprime crisis on financial develpment, the dummy CRISIS assumes
value 1 for years 2008 and 2009 and 0 elsewhere.

       The use of the dynamic panel, in which the lagged dependent variable is used as an
explanatory variable, allows to analyze the banking market structure effect on financial
development controlled by the persistence effect (De Mendonça and De Moraes, 2018). This is
possible because the lagged financial development possesses large part of the explanation of
financial development. Therefore, the current degree of financial development is expected to
be affected by past financial development as well as by lagged banking variables (NPL and
CAR) and lagged macroeconomic variables (INTR, GDP and INFL). Hence, we estimate the
following specification:
                                                                                                5

𝜀 is the residual of the estimation.
        Despite this advantage, the use of the lagged dependent variable in the models generates
bias and inconsistency. To avoid correlation issues between the explanatory variables and the
error, resulting in biased and inconsistent estimates, the study makes use of the systemic GMM
(S-GMM), which resorts to instrumental variables to address possible endogeneity issues
(Arellano and Bover, 1995). With the purpose of avoiding excess of instruments in the
regressions, harming the statistical power of the test, the amount of instruments used in the
study is smaller than the number of cross-sections. To confirm the validity of the estimations
reported, the test of over-identifying restrictions (J-test) is performed (Arellano, 2003). In
addition, the first and second order serial auto-correlation tests (AR1 and AR2) are also
performed.


3. Empirical Analysis


       In this section, we analyze the effects of banking market structure on financial
development. In particular, the analysis of the effect of concentration on financial
development is presented on Tables 3, 4, 7 and 8, whereas the analysis of competition is
displayed on Tables 5, 6, 9 and 10.


3.1. Financial Development (FI) and Banking Concentration

        This section analyzes the effect of banking concentration on financial development (FI).
Table 3 reports the results for the full sample, which comprises all the countries analyzed, and
Table 4 presents the results for developing countries. In general, the indicators of banking
concentration present negative signs and statistical significance in all models, providing
evidence that an increase in banking concentration (BANK_5, BANK_3) leads to a reduction
in financial development. These results suggest that countries with a large amount of assets
concentrated in a few banks (three or five in our analysis) constrain financial development, i.e.,
diminish the relevance, accessibility and efficiency of the countries' financial systems.
        The credit risk (NPL) presents negative signs and statistical significance in all models,
implying that countries exposed to high credit risk may experiment low financial development.
Since banking behavior is forward-looking (De Moraes, Antunes and Montes, 2016), the
persistence of high levels of NPL may discourage banks to incur in additional risk-taking,
leading to low financial development. As for the CAR, the negative signs in all models suggest
the existence of a trade-off between capital regulation, measured by the capital adequacy ratio,
                                                                                                6



and financial development. Hence, the more solvent the banks are, the higher the CAR and the
lower the financial development.
        Regarding the macroeconomic variables, the signs and significance of the GDP
coefficients reveal a negative relationship between economic growth and financial development
(FI), both in the full sample and in the developing countries analysis. In terms of inflation
(INFL) and the interest rate (INTR), the full sample analysis shows evidence that both variables
curb financial development. Concerning the developing countries analysis, although INFL and
INTR present negative signs in all the models, only the interest rate (INTR) is significant. These
results are expected, for during periods of high interest rates financial development is curbed.
Finally, the crisis dummy evidences that financial development is adversely affected by periods
of crisis.

Note: Marginal significance levels: (***) denotes 0.01, (**) denotes 0.05, and (*) denotes 0.1. White’s heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix was applied in regressions. Standard errors between
parentheses. S-GMM – uses two-step of Arellano and Bover (1995) without time period effects. S-GMM estimator – tests for AR (1) and AR (2) check for the presence of first order and second-order
serial correlation in the first-difference residuals. The sample is an unbalanced panel with annual data of 89 countries (61 developing countries and 28 developed countries, see table A1 in the
appendix) from 2006 to 2015.

3.2. Financial Development (FI) and Banking Competition

       In this section we analyze the effect of banking competition (Lerner and Boone indexes)
on financial development (FI). Table 5 reports the full sample results, where all countries are
analyzed altogether, while Table 6 reports the results for the sample of developing countries.
        In general, the coefficients of the Lerner index present negative signs and statistical
significance. Concerning the Boone index, the estimations involving developing countries show
the expected sign and statistical significance. The negative relationship between the degree of
competition and financial development indicates that an economic environment of higher
competitiveness leads to a higher financial development. Thus, there is evidence that financial
development can be fostered if greater incentives for competitiveness are provided.
        In most of the estimations, the NPL negative signs and statistical significance evidence
that an increase in credit risk constrains financial development. It is also noteworthy that the
negative sign and statistical significance of the CAR variable in the developing countries’
analysis strengthens the existence of a trade-off between capital regulation and financial
development. At last, the crisis dummy results corroborate the effect of crises’ periods in
financial development. These results corroborate the findings in the banking concentration
analysis.


3.3. Credit, Concentration and Banking Competition

        The results obtained in the previous subsections indicate that banking market structure
can constrain financial development. An increase in the banking market power derived from
high concentration or low competition can harm financial development. Therefore, to
corroborate these findings, Tables 7 to 10 present the estimates for the domestic credit provided
by the financial sector as a percentage of GDP (CRED_GDP), a measure long-stablished in the
literature (Levine, 2003).
      In particular, Tables 7 and 8 report the effect of banking concentration (Bank_5,
Bank_3) on the CRED_GDP for the full sample and for the developing countries, respectively.
The same goes for Tables 9 and 10, which report the effect of banking competition (Lerner,
Boone indexes) on the CRED_GDP.

        The statistical significance and negative signs of banking concentration and competition
coefficients (Tables 7 to 10) indicate that high banking concentration, as well as low banking
competition, reduces the availability of credit in the countries’ financial systems, measured by
the CRED_GDP. These results suggest that an increase in banking market power can lead the
financial systems to credit rationing, shedding light on the credit market behavior under a
banking market structure perspective.
        Regarding the banking variables, the NPL stands out both in the full sample and in the
developing countries analysis. There is evidence that an increase in the NPL deprives the
amount of credit in the countries. With respect to CAR, which is a proxy for financial stability,
the results emphasize the trade-off with financial development, proxied by the CRED_GDP.
        The conclusions concerning the effects of the macroeconomic variables on financial
development (CRED_GDP) corroborate the conclusions previously obtained for FI. In this
sense, the results indicate that increments of the interest rate may hinder financial development.
The behavior of real interest rates is, to some extent, a reflection of monetary policy, which
may affect the amount of credit in the economy. The coefficients of the variable INFL
(inflation) also confirm the preceding results, suggesting that uncertainties generated by high
inflation rates lag financial development.
         It is expected a positive relationship between gdp growth and credit to gdp ratio.
However, the negative effect of GDP on CRED_GDP, though not expected, can be explained
by the reasoning that underpins the CRED_GDP. Therefore, an increase (reduction) in the gdp
growth can lead to a reduction (increase) in the credit to gdp ratio. The CRISIS dummy, which
captures the effects of the financial crisis in the period 2008/2009, holds the negative signs and
statistical significance in most of the models, suggesting that financial development deteriorates
during crises.
        Thus, the estimates for banking concentration and banking competition in relation to the
credit to gdp ratio (CRED_GDP) for the full sample, as well as for the developing countries,
corroborate the results obtained in the main analysis involving financial development (FI). In
short, banking market power is an issue, and improvement in banking market structure (a
decrease in concentration or an increase in competition) is relevant to financial development.

Note: Marginal significance levels: (***) denotes 0.01, (**) denotes 0.05, and (*) denotes 0.1. White’s heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix was applied in regressions. Standard errors between
parentheses. S-GMM – uses two-step of Arellano and Bover (1995) without time period effects. S-GMM estimator – tests for AR (1) and AR (2) check for the presence of first order and second-order
serial correlation in the first-difference residuals. The sample is an unbalanced panel with annual data of 89 countries (61 developing countries and 28 developed countries, see table A1 in the appendix)

4. Conclusion

        This paper analyzes, through a panel with 89 countries from 2006 to 2015, how financial
development reacts to banking market structure (banking concentration and banking
competition). The main results are that a greater degree of banking concentration or less
competitive banking sector reduce countries’ financial development and the amount of credit
supply. This is also true for emerging countries. These results suggest that the way the banking
sector is structured is important for the financial service offer in different kind of countries.
Therefore, the result of this study sheds light on a new issue of banking market power: a
financial system concentrated or uncompetitive constrains financial development.

            The Lerner index is defined as the difference between price and marginal cost, divided by price. It indicates the effective behavior of the banks by measuring a bank's
 LERNER     ability to set its price above the marginal cost and therefore the market power of the bank individually. This index is used as a proxy for bank competition.                World Bank
            LERNER's higher values indicate less competition. This index was multiplied by 100, without prejudice to the values. Series code GFDD.OI.04.
            This index is a measure of the degree of bank competition, calculated as the elasticity of profits relative to marginal costs. The rationale behind the indicator is that
 BOONE      higher profits are achieved by more efficient banks. An increase in the Boone index indicates an inhibition of the competitive conduct of financial intermediaries.          World Bank
