          This paper proposes a model to study how conditional lending and immediate liquidity provision
      a¤ect incentives for …scal adjustment in a country facing the risk of sovereign default. Conditional
      lending provides explicit incentives for …scal adjustment but immediate liquidity provision is more
      e¤ective in reducing liquidation costs. For some parameters, immediate liquidity provision in-
      duces …scal adjustment and debt repayment, while conditional lending does not (and vice-versa).
      Incentives for …scal adjustment are concave in the fraction of lending that is provided under con-
      ditionalities. Therefore, the best strategy for an international lending of last resort might be a
      balance between immediate liquidity support and conditional lending. A large cost of tight …scal
      policy shifts the balance towards immediate liquidity provision.
