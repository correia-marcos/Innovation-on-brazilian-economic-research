Abstract
This paper fills a gap in the literature on residential energy consumption in Brazil. We estimate
price and income elasticities for residential electricity consumption using disaggregated data at
household level for the São Paulo metropolitan area. Data were obtained from Fundação
Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas (Fipe), which has complete access to Pesquisa de
Orçamento Familiar (POF). Information about residential electricity consumption and
household characteristics was available at two different periods, 1998 and 2008, which enabled
us to adopt panel data estimation procedures. This study is the first to use Brazilian household
level data on electricity consumption and a panel approach to estimate price and income
elasticities. The results show that the price elasticity ranges from -0.26 to -0.64 and the income
elasticity between 0.11 and 0.32. Controlling for a variety of fixed effects, household and family
characteristics, price and income elasticities for the short-run are, approximately, -0.50, and
0.21.

Este trabalho preenche uma lacuna na literatura sobre o consumo residencial de energia elétrica
no Brasil. Estimamos as elasticidades-preço e renda para o consumo de eletricidade usando
dados desagregados em nível residencial para a área metropolitana de São Paulo. Os dados
foram obtidos na Fipe, que possui acesso completo à POF. As informações sobre o consumo de
eletricidade e características familiares estavam disponíveis para dois períodos diferentes, 1998
e 2008, nos permitindo adotar procedimentos de estimação para dados em painel. Este estudo
é o primeiro a utilizar dados brasileiros em nível familiar e uma abordagem de painel para
estimar as elasticidades preço e renda da demanda residencial de eletricidade. Os resultados
mostram que a elasticidade-preço varia de -0,26 a -0,64 e a elasticidade-renda entre 0,11 e 0,32.
Controlando para uma variedade de efeitos fixos, características domésticas e familiares, as

1. Introduction

        The electric power market is key to the growth and development of any economy. One
of the most important issues in this area is to understand how the demand for residential energy
changes when both the price of electricity and the income of consumers are varying (Dilaver
and Hunt, 2011; Chang et al., 2014). The correct identification of the demand function
parameters for residential energy consumption is relevant for the provision of estimates of
future demand. An accurate estimation of price and income elasticities for residential electrical
consumption serve as valuable inputs for policymakers and for electric companies in terms of
investments in infrastructure, energy production, distribution structure, and profitability
analysis (Medlock III and Soligo, 2001; Silk and Joutz, 1997; Beenstock et al., 1999; Chang et
al., 2009; Nakajima and Hamori, 2010; Labandeira et al., 2017).
        Although there are many publications regarding the energy sector in Brazil, there are
few studies that estimate the price and income elasticities for the residential urban sector and
even fewer that use some level of disaggregated data. This paper fills a gap in the literature on
residential energy consumption in Brazil. We are the first to empirically estimate price and
income elasticities for residential electricity consumption using disaggregated data at the
household level. Household level data is more informative because we can monitor the
consumers in different periods of time using a panel structure. It also allows us to control for
household and family characteristics that might affect energy consumption, seasonality, and
other unobservable characteristics by using fixed effects.
        We use data from the Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar (POF, or Household Budget
Survey) which is conducted by the Fundação Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica (FIPE, or
Economic Research Institute Foundation). The data collected by the POF survey is not entirely
open to the public because it contains private information regarding the interviewed families.
We had access to the complete sample and could obtain information about the household’s
energy consumption, family income, property details, among other variables. The sample
covers residences in the metropolitan area of São Paulo and was available at two different
periods, 1998-99 (POF98) and 2008-13 (POF08), which enabled us to adopt panel data
estimation procedures and to control for a variety of fixed effects. In general terms, the
estimated price elasticities range from -0.46 to -0.56, and the income elasticities range from
0.20 to 0.32. Therefore, our main contribution to empirical research is an accurate estimation
of price and income elasticities for the residential electrical consumption for the São Paulo
metropolitan area.
        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides an
overview of the residential electrical energy market in Brazil, followed by a brief empirical
literature review in Section 3. Subsequently, in Section 4, the model specification and data are
presented and discussed. Next, we present the empirical results with a robustness checks
section. Finally, conclusions and political implications are discussed in section 6.

2. Production, distribution, price policies and residential energy consumption in Brazil

 According to the Brazilian Energy Balance (MME, 2016), electricity generation in Brazil
comes mainly from hydropower, corresponding to 64% of the domestic electricity supply.
Other main sources are natural gas (12.9%), biomass (8%), oil sub-products, coal, and coal sub-
products (9.3%). The Wind, solar and nuclear sources account for the remaining 5,91%. Public
service plants are the largest producers, generating 83% of total capacity. Electricity
consumption and generation have been growing since the 1970s, experiencing short periods of
decline (as in the energy crises of 2001). The residential use of firewood and other indoor
polluting energy sources have declined with the expansion of the electric system to rural
locations. The Federal program Luz Para Todos (Light for All), launched in 2003, is the most
famous initiative and aimed at bringing access to electricity, free of charge, to more than 10
million rural people living in vulnerable conditions (WEO, 2013). Besides these expansion and
inclusion policies, the residential sector has experienced growth rates of 4.9% a year (from 2003
to 2012) mainly due to easy credit conditions for consumers with reflections over the sales of
home electrical appliances (Villareal and Moreira, 2016; Achão and Schaeffer, 2009; WEO,
2013). In 2015 the residential electric consumption corresponded to 25% of the total market,
the industrial sector is the main consumer, with 37.6% (MME, 2016). Although expected to
continue growing in the upcoming years, when compared to developed countries, electricity
consumption in Brazil is still very small (Villareal and Moreira, 2016).
         With regards to household electricity prices, the majority of consumers face flat rates,
that is, retail prices are fixed and defined by ANEEL (National Agency for Electric Energy).
Created in 1997, ANEEL is responsible for regulating and supervising the power sector and
energy prices and for boosting efficiency advances in the generation and distribution of energy
(WEO, 2013; ANEEL, 2008). The main players in the sector are the energy generating
companies, that produce the energy; the transmission companies, responsible for transporting
energy from the point of generation to the consumer centers; and the distribution companies,
which take energy to the home of the consumer. The costs of generation (31.33%), transmission
(6.25%) and distribution (28.98%) are included in the final consumer's bill, plus taxes and
charges at different levels of government (33.45%)1. Energy tariffs for the electric sector are
revised every 4-5 years (obeying regulatory periods for concessions' contracts) to establish a
new plateau for prices and are also adjusted annually in accordance with inflation rates and
other distribution costs (Corton et al., 2016; ANEEL, 2008). Following these rules, from 2003
to 2007, residential electricity prices had a real increase of 32% (ANEEL, 2008).
         Until 1993, energy prices were uniform for the entire territory. Federal Law 8.631 ended
this model and the tariff became fixed by concession area: a geographic territory where each
distribution company is contractually obliged to supply electricity, which may or may not
coincide with the limits of the federative units (a single state can have more than one concession
area and, therefore, more than one energy tariff). Thus, according to ANEEL (2008), energy
tariffs reflect the peculiarities of each region, such as the number of consumers, the size of the

consumer market or the distribution network, state and local taxes, among other factors.
Additionally, in Brazil, the electricity tariff is calculated according to consumption classes:
residential; industrial; commercial and services; rural; public power; street lighting; public
service, and own consumption. Each class has a distinct tariff structure, according to the
peculiarities of energy consumption and power demand.
        Regarding residential consumers, energy prices vary according to the type of residential
connection: whether in single-phase, two-phase or three-phase circuits. There are also low
income and indigenous groups that receive substantial energy subsidies. The Social Energy
Tariff was created in 2002 by the Federal Law 10.438 and it is intended to give a discount to
the energy bill of low-income consumers in different categories of consumption with the
objective of expanding and democratizing the access to electricity. Federal Law 12.212/2010
and Decree 7.583/2011, defined the socio-economic criteria2 for receiving the benefit and
stipulated the discounts3. Prior to that, ANEEL was the responsible for the direct regulation of
the abatement4.

3. Brief empirical literature review

        Several international studies seek to estimate the price and income elasticities for the
residential electricity consumption. However, the literature for Brazil is still relatively scarce
(Uhr et al., 2017). In this section, we present a short review of the empirical studies for the field.

3.1 International literature

        The international empirical literature is rich, mainly at the country level (e.g., Table 1)
but also for regional applications (Zhang et al., 2017; Gomez et al., 2013; Hosoe and Akiyama,
2009).

  Until 2010, the reductions in the light bill varied between 10% and 65% with an automatic discount for
residences with consumption below 80 kWh monthly. Between 80 kWh and 220 kWh, households with a per
capita family income of up to R $ 120.00 were entitled to the benefit.
        Table 1 presents selected empirical studies that seek to identify the price and/or income
elasticities for household electricity demand, for the short and long terms or both. Calculated
elasticities are shown at the end of the table. It should be noted that the identification of price
elasticities receives more attention in the literature than the estimation of income elasticities.
Table 1 also depicts data location, the period of analysis, and employed methodology for each
selected study.

3.2 Brazilian literature

       Although there are many publications regarding the energy sector in Brazil 5, there are
few studies that estimate price and income elasticities for residential electricity consumption
and even fewer use some level of disaggregated data. Table 2 presents a summary of the
empirical studies published in Brazil that estimate such elasticities.

Notes: Uhr et al. (2017) use a state level panel comprising all Brazilian regions. Irffi et al. (2009) and Siqueira et
al. (2006) work with the same aggregated dataset comprising the northeast region of Brazil. Mattos and Lima
(2005) use data only for the state of Minas Gerais. The remaining studies work with aggregated data for Brazil.

        Uhr et al. (2017) is the only study with some level of disaggregation. The authors
estimate short-term and long-term price and income elasticities for the residential electricity
consumption using data for the Brazilian states with a panel structure and a Difference GMM
approach (Arellano and Bond, 1991). They estimate seven models incorporating different sets
of control variables and find short-term price elasticities varying between 0.13% to -0.18% and
the long-term price elasticity ranging between -0.617% to -1.472%. The short-term estimates
for the income-elasticity range between 0.08% and 0.12%, and long-run coefficients between
0.324% to 1.095%.
        All the remaining studies are based on time series analysis and aggregated data for Brazil
or for specific regions mainly because of “data availability” issues (Villareal and Moreira, 2016;
Viana and Silva, 2014; Irffi et al., 2009; Siqueira et al., 2006; Mattos and Lima, 2005; Schmidt
and Lima, 2004; Andrade and Lobão, 1997; Modiano, 1984). Some estimate only long-run
elasticities and only Villareal and Moreira (2016) work with recent data.

4. Model Specification and Data

4.1. Model

       Consider the Cobb-Douglas demand function with the following form:

                                  𝐶𝑖𝑡 = 𝐴𝑖𝑡 (𝑃𝑖𝑡 )𝛼1 (𝐼𝑖𝑡 )𝛼2 𝑒 𝑋𝑖𝑡𝜹                            (1)

        In equation (1) the subscript i represents the individual and the subscript t represents
different time periods. 𝐶𝑖𝑡 is the demand for residential energy, 𝑃𝑖𝑡 is the price of electricity
(energy tariff), 𝐼𝑖𝑡 is the real income, and 𝑋𝑖𝑡 is a vector of control variables that affect the
energy consumption. Taking the natural logarithm of equation (1), we have:

                          𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑖𝑡 = lnA𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼1 𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼2 𝑙𝑛𝐼𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 𝛿                           (2)

       Replacing lnA𝑖𝑡 by the terms (𝜇𝑖 + 𝜃𝑡 ) and adding a stochastic error term 𝑢𝑖𝑡 in equation
(2), we come to the following econometric specification:

                       𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑖𝑡 = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜃𝑡 + 𝛼1 𝑙𝑛𝑃𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼2 𝑙𝑛𝐼𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 𝛿 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡                      (3)

        Equation (3) requires a panel data approach to control the fixed effects relative to the
characteristics of the consumer that are constant over time (𝜇𝑖 ). It should be noted, however,
that the residential consumer might have his electricity consumption level associated with
household structural characteristics (h) and/or family characteristics (f). In addition, the weather
might have seasonal/monthly effects (m) on the energy bill, as might specific years (y), e.g.,
during summer or a year with abnormally high temperatures. Therefore, our empirical strategy
follows the following equation:

          𝑙𝑛𝐶ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦 = 𝜇ℎ + 𝜋𝑓 + 𝜔𝑚 + 𝜃𝑦 + 𝛼1 𝑙𝑛𝑃ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦 + 𝛼2 𝑙𝑛𝐼ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦 + 𝑋ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦 𝛿 + 𝑢ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦 (4)

         Terms 𝜇ℎ , 𝜋𝑓 , 𝜔𝑚 , 𝜃𝑡 are the mentioned fixed effects. The subscripts h, f, m, and t,
represent, respectively, the same household, the same family observed in the two different time
periods of the sample (1998-99 and 2008-13), the month of observation, and year of
observation. The dependent variable, 𝑙𝑛𝐶ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡 , is the residential energy consumption, defined
as the natural logarithm of the consumed kWh (kilowatts per hour). The coefficients of interest
are 𝛼1 and 𝛼2 , which represent, respectively, the price and income elasticities of household
electricity demand, which are associated with variables 𝑙𝑛𝑃ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡 and 𝑙𝑛𝐼ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡 . The first is the
amount paid per kWh and the last the household income. The interpretation of the coefficients
is straightforward:

                          𝜕𝑙𝑛𝐶ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦                   𝜕𝑙𝑛𝐶ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦
                                     = 𝛼1 and                     = 𝛼2                          (5)
                          𝜕𝑙𝑛𝑃ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦                   𝜕𝑙𝑛𝐼ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑦

        The vector containing the control variables is represented by 𝑋ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡 . The parameter
vector 𝛿 identifies the effects of the controls on energy consumption. Finally, 𝑢ℎ𝑓𝑚𝑡 represents
the random disturbance.
        Controls are separated into 5 groups: Group 1 representing household architectonic
characteristics (number of rooms, bathrooms and restrooms in the residence), Group 2 for
electrical equipment ownership (number of sound systems, air conditionings, vacuum cleaners,
electric showers, microwaves, refrigerators, irons, washing machines, and computers in the
residence), Group 3 representing property status (if own residence, residence in acquisition,
leased, rented, and others) and kind of residence (if house, apartment or flat, and others,) Group
4 containing household occupant’s characteristics (average age of the residents, number of
occupants under 18 years, and the instruction degree of the head of the family), and Group 5
for social benefits variables (if one of the occupants receives Bolsa Familia6 or enrolls in
another social benefit program or if this person receives at least half of the national minimum
wage).
         For the correct identification of the price and income elasticities, we must make sure
that all possible sources of bias in the parameters are controlled for. Basically, we might have
three major sources of endogeneity: measurement error, simultaneity, and omitted variable bias.
The first is unlikely because data collection was done randomly by a known research center
with experienced personnel. It should be noted that there is no selection bias in the sample
because data collection did not depend on the choice of the consumers. The second source of
endogeneity, the simultaneity problem, is not sustainable because electric energy prices are
regulated by the central government and the residential energy tariff is rigid in the short-run (it
does not react to changes in demand). If doubts, check section 2.
         The third source of endogeneity must be carefully considered. The omitted variable bias
occurs when we disregard relevant variables that are potentially correlated with the other
explanatory variables (prices and income). On that case, the error term becomes correlated with
the explanatory variables and the estimates become biased and inconsistent. The panel data
approach allows us to eliminate that bias when the omitted variables are constant over time,
such as those within a given household, or a given family.

4.2. Data

        We use data from the Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar (POF, or Household Budget
Survey) which is conducted by the Fundação Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica (FIPE, or
Economic Research Institute Foundation). The data collected by the POF survey is not entirely
open to the public because it contains private information regarding the interviewed families.
We had access to the complete sample and could obtain information about the household's
energy consumption, family income, property details, among other variables. The sample
covers residences in the metropolitan area of São Paulo and was available at two different
periods, 1998-99 (POF98) and 2008-13 (POF08). For the first sample, information was
collected from 1,207 residences between 1998 and 1999, with households being selected
randomly. The second period of the collection took place during the years 2008 to 2013 and
information was collected from 3,126 residences. The second survey followed the households
of the first sampling, and randomly enlarged the sample, that is, domiciles interviewed in the
first sample were also interviewed for the second sample. This allowed us to control for
residential and family fixed effects as mentioned before.
        To estimate price and income elasticities for the residential electricity consumption we
consider those families that had information about the electricity bill, with the consumption of
electric energy (kWh) and paid values. Thus, the valid sample for the POF98 was 627
residences and for the POF08, 947 households. There are 270 domiciles with information for
the light bill that are observed in both samples. Missing data on electric power consumption is

likely caused by the resident not having the energy bill for that month available for presentation
to the researcher at the time of the interview7.
         The variable for the household energy consumption is given by the kilowatts appearing
in the light bill that were consumed in the same month of the interview. The interviewers did
not consider previous electricity bills. Therefore, consumed energy and paid values were
collected only upon the exhibition of the current light bill. Since energy tariff information was
not gathered by the research, we calculate the electricity price by dividing the total paid value
by the amount consumed in that residence8. For the empirical analysis, both variables are
transformed to the natural logarithm. The per capita family income was calculated by the
summing up all individual incomes and then dividing it by the number of economically active
agents in that residence. For the empirical analysis, this variable was also transformed to the
natural logarithm. The use of these variables in the natural logarithm form allows us to directly
identify the price and income elasticities that are represented by the associated angular
coefficients in the linear regressions.
        Control variables are divided into five groups. Group 1 representing household
architectonic characteristics (number of rooms, bathrooms and restrooms in the residence),
Group 2 for electrical equipment ownership (number of sound systems, air conditionings,
vacuum cleaners, electric showers, microwaves, refrigerators, irons, washing machines, and
computers in the residence), Group 3 representing property status (if own residence, residence
in acquisition, leased, rented, and others) and kind of residence (if house, apartment or flat, and
others,) Group 4 containing household occupant's characteristics (average age of the residents,
number of occupants under 18 years, and the instruction degree of the head of the family), and
Group 5 for social benefits variables (if the person who pays the bill receives Bolsa Familia9or
enrolls in another social benefit program – SocialTariff1 – or if this person receives as paycheck
not more than half of the national minimum wage – SocialTariff2)10. For the variables in group
4, the average age of the residents is constructed by dividing the sum of the ages of all residents,
by the number of people living in the domicile. The instruction degree of the head of the family
is given by seven education dummies11.
        Additionally, we have dummy variables identifying if the same residence is observed in
both periods (POF 98 and POF08) if the same family continued living in the interviewed
households12, the month of data collection and the year of data collection. In that way, we could
control for household fixed-effects, family fixed-effects, seasonal/monthly fixed-effects, and
macroeconomic/policy shocks captured by year fixed-effects.
        Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics separated by the two sampling periods, POF98
and POF08.

  We can consider that the domiciles left the panel randomly because we have information for all the other
variables besides the energy bill. According to Cameron and Triverdi (2005) and Baltagi (2008), if missing data
are random, then converting it into a panel structure results in a nonbiased sample. Therefore, analysis
considering unbalanced or incomplete panels entails, at most, only a loss of efficiency.

  We are dealing with the actual cost of electricity to the families, considering the costs of generation,
transmission, and distribution, that are incorporated into the energy tariff, plus taxes and charges at federal, state,
and municipal levels. Paid values were deflated using the Consumer Price Index (General prices) calculated by
FIPE (IPC/FIPE) and January 1998 as the reference period.

       We can see from Table 3 that both periods have similar means for most variables.
However, it's important to note that both electricity consumption and energy prices are lower
for the second period of sample13. Regarding the controls, the majority remains very close

  The energy/rationing crises of 2001 changed the Brazilian habits regarding energy consumption. Even with
lower prices, the residential energy consumption returned to 2000 levels only in 2005 (WEO,2013). During the
between periods, except for the number of dishwashers, number of computers, and the average
age of the residents.


5. Empirical results

        Estimation results for equation (4) are reported in Table 4. We present nine models
differing basically in the use of control variables. Specification 1 is a Pooled OLS with no
controls and/or fixed-effects. Subsequent models add separately both the fixed effects as well
as the control variables and are estimated using panel data techniques. In the last specification
(Model 9) all controls and fixed-effects are considered. Price and income elasticities of
household electricity demand, for each specification, are represented by the 𝜀𝑃 and 𝜀𝐼
coefficients, respectively.
        The results reported in Table 4 show that the price elasticity
(𝜀𝑃 ) has the expected sign, being negative for all proposed specifications and it’s mostly
inelastic. This means that an increase in the residential cost of energy reduces the amount of
kWh consumed by the individual households, but with smaller impact reflecting the “essential-
good” characteristic of electric energy. In more specific terms, the calculated price elasticities
vary between -0.4445 (model 3) and -0.5644 (model 1). For the complete specification (Model
9), a 1% increase in the residential electricity cost reduces the residential energy consumption
by 0.50%.
        The results for income elasticity (𝜀𝐼 ) also show the expected signs, with positive
coefficients across specifications. The coefficients magnitudes vary between 0.1977 (model 8)
and 0.3222 (model 1), reflecting that increases in real income produce positive impacts on
energy consumption. However, as for the price elasticities, these impacts are small. Considering
the Model (9), a 1% increase in the average household income implies an increase of
approximately 0.21% in residential electric energy consumption. That is, the residential
consumption of electric energy is income-inelastic.
        In general terms, the results in Table 4 are different from those at previous works for
Brazil. The comparison of our results with the existing literature is hard because the periods of
analysis are different, as well as the applied methodologies and the data’s degree of aggregation.
As highlighted in the literature review, no other work for Brazil has identified price and income
elasticities with this level of data disaggregation, nor with the applied methodology. It should
be noted, however, that Siqueira et al. (2006) fond relatively close coefficients. Their calculated
price and income elasticities are, respectively, 0.30, and 0.18. They use aggregated data for
Northeast Brazil and the 1970-2003 period.
        With respect to the international literature, the works of Schulte and Heindl (2017),
Wang and Mogi (2017), Zhou and Teng (2013), Arthur et al. (2012), Filippini and Pachauri
(2004), and Nesbakken et al. (1999) found a price elasticity of electric energy demand close to
-0.50, for different countries and different data structures. Zhou and Teng (2013), using urban-
household level data for China, also found an income elasticity close to 0.21.
        The next section presents robustness checks for our results.




1998-2008 period, we also observe the expansion of electricity access to low-income families through energy
programs (Luz para Todos, Tarifa Social de Energia), social programs (Bolsa Familia and others) and economic
growth.

5.1. Robustness Checks

        Here we consider different samples and methodologies than from the previous
section. We first identify the price and income elasticities by disaggregating the valid data
for each sample separately (POF98 and POF08). In model (1) we calculate the
coefficients considering the POF98 using a standard OLS approach. In specification (2)
we consider observations from POF08 and estimate de elasticities also using an OLS
methodology.
        In the model (3) data are aggregated and price and income elasticities are
estimated using a random effects approach (RE-FGLS). For the model (4) we restrict the
sample only to the households that appear in both samples and run the regression
assuming the random effects hypothesis (RE-FGLS). In specification (5) we also restrict
the sample to repeating residences but calculate the coefficients with a First-Difference
methodology. Finally, we present the fixed effects model only for the households that
repeat in both samples (balanced panel with fixed-effects, model 6).
        Table 5 presents the results for all six models, considering robust standard errors
for heteroscedasticity in all specifications.

Notes: Significance level, * < 0.10; **<0.05; ***<0.01; Robust t-statistics in parentheses. We consider all
the controls from Model 9 in Table 4, except for specifications 1 and 2 because they are cross-sections
estimated with OLS approach (the fixed effects of residence and family are not considered). Is Model 3,
the hypothesis of random effects is considered for households, but family, month and year fixed effects are
also included. Models 4 to 6 are balanced panels. Model 4 is estimated under random effects. Models 5 and
6 control for household fixed-effects using first-difference and fixed-effects techniques, respectively.

        In Table 5, all estimations show the expected signs and are statistically significant
for the price elasticity (𝜀𝑃 ) and the income elasticity (𝜀𝐼 ). Models 1 and 2 show a large
variation between the estimated coefficients for the two different periods using OLS
methodology. Models 4 to 6 show more similar results to table 4, even though they have
significantly smaller samples. Price elasticity ranges between -0.505 and -0.498. Income
elasticities are between 0.278 and 0.17. We apply a Hausman specification test to
compare models 4 and 6 and results suggest that the fixed effects approach is
recommended (Chi² of 84.35 with a p-value of 0.0017).
        Model 6, restricting the sample to only those households that appear in both
samples (balanced panel with fixed-effects), produced the same coefficients as Model 9
in Table 4 (unbalanced panel with all controls and fixed-effects). Therefore, in both
models, the price elasticity of residential energy demand is -0.5038 (𝜀𝑃 ), and the income
price elasticity for residential energy demand is 0.2054 (𝜀𝐼 ).

6. Conclusions and Policy Implications

      This paper fills a gap in the literature on residential energy consumption in Brazil.
We are the first to empirically estimate price and income elasticities for household
electricity consumption using microdata and a panel approach. Household level data is
more informative than aggregated data because we can control for household and family
characteristics that might affect energy consumption, seasonality, and other unobservable
characteristics, such as macroeconomic/policy shocks, by using fixed effects. We also
include a variety of observable variables as controls for household architectonic
characteristics, electrical equipment ownership, property status, kind of residence,
household occupant’s characteristics, and social benefits. No previous work for Brazil
employs this level of disaggregation and such comprehensive list of individual
characteristics to estimate the parameters. Therefore, our main contribution to empirical
research is an accurate identification of price and income elasticities for the residential
electrical consumption for the São Paulo metropolitan area.
        The estimated price elasticity ranges from -0.26 to -0.64, and the estimated income
elasticity between 0.11 and 0.32. Considering the most appropriate model, the price and
income elasticities of the demand for residential electric power are, approximately, -0.50,
and 0.21, respectively. Results are robust even for different methodologies and selected
smaller samples. The unbalanced panel with all controls and fixed-effects included
(Model 9 in Table 4) produced the same coefficients as the balanced panel with the
smaller sample and fixed effects (Model 6 in Table 5). Considering those models, the
price-elasticity of residential energy demand and the income-elasticity of residential
energy demand are, respectively, -0.50 and 0.21, revealing that the consumption of
electricity is inelastic and responds very little to increases in the cost of energy or family
income.
        The policy implications of the presented results are diverse. We have identified
that the consumer's sensitivity to price and income variations is small so that increases in
real family income will have little impact on the demand for energy, as increases in the
energy cost. The calculated elasticities can be used by policymakers, energy production
and distribution companies to target investment and/or forecasting strategies. In addition,
indirectly, the results can serve as instruments for environmental policies and studies
associated with the generation of greenhouse gases.
