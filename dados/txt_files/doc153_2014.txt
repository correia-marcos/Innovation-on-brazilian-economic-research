Abstract
This article follows the debate initiated by Florida (2002) and Glaeser (2005) of which measures of
human capital have better prediction on economic performance of cities (urban dynamism), Creative
Class or more traditional education indicators. Using micro-level data extracted from Brazilians Census
(1991, 2000 and 2010), we propose a Spatial Durbin Panel analysis for measuring the effect of Creative
Class and of Schooling on urban dynamism, an approach that allow us to control for municipalities fixed
effect, year effect and spatial spillover effect. In addition, following LeSage and Pace (2009), we
measure the effects of these variables by calculating the direct, indirect and total effects. The results show
that education or schooling indicators have higher association with urban dynamism than creativity
indicators. This suggests that, for the Brazilian context, is better for policy makers support accumulation
of high education per se, than to focus on policies that aim at attracting professionals in creative
occupations.

Resumo
Motivado pelo debate entre Florida (2002) e Gleaser (2005) a respeito da importância da Classe Criativa
como medida de capital humano, o trabalho faz uso dos microdados dos Censos Demográficos brasileiros
de 1991, 2000 e 2010 e especificações econométrica representadas por painéis espaciais (Spatial Durbin
Panel Models) para investigar a importância deste tipo específico de ocupação vis à vis medidas
tradicionais de capital humano na determinação da dinâmica de crescimento do emprego das cidades
brasileiras. Os resultados obtidos a partir dos painéis espaciais, que permitem o controle para a influência
dos efeitos fixos das cidades, efeitos específicos dos períodos e transbordamentos espaciais dos efeitos
das variáveis, indicam que as medidas mais tradicionais de capital humano, como por exemplo, o
percentual de pessoas com o ensino superior, apresentam associações mais significativas e robustas com o
dinamismo do empregos das cidades brasileiras que as diferentes medidas de Classe Criativa disponíveis
na literatura, o que é percebido a partir do calculo dos efeitos diretos e indiretos das variáveis sobre o
crescimento do emprego.

Creative Class, Human Capital and Urban Dynamism: Empirical Evidence for the Brazilian Cities
1. Introduction
        There is well-known literature showing that human capital plays an important role in economic
growth both at the country level (Lucar Jr, 1988; Romer, 1990; Benhabid and Spiegel, 1994) and the
regional level (Moretti, 2004; Marracu and Paci, 2012, 2013). Nevertheless, it is still debatable what
measure of human capital best predicts economic development. Since the publication of Florida’s seminal
book (2002), many scholars have started to investigate the role of creative people as one driver of
economic performance. The creative professions are those occupations which necessarily need innovative
and creative behavior. Since this kind of behavior is very conducive to the production process, especially
because it is closely linked to technological innovation and increased productivity, those occupations
have characteristically been desired for enhancing economic performance. The hypothesis is that the
presence of creative people improves the quality of the economic environment. Said differently, a region
whose population is proportionally more employed in creative occupations has more conditions that
stimulate economic growth. One possible explanation is that the method of this kind of individual is to
identify problems, discover original solutions, generate new ideas, and create new technologies. This may
have a positive effect on the attraction of new firms, which in turn attracts more skilled workers and then
generates a virtuous cycle that improves the regional economy.
        The first question that arose from Florida’s contribution was what is the best way to measure
creativity? It is not straightforward to define which occupations possess innovative and creative tasks. For
many scholars, Florida’s definition of a creative class was too vague and hardly convertible for distinct
countries’ contexts (Markusen, 2006; Wojan et al., 2007). So many proposals for measuring creativity
were put forward by researchers. Each new definition was based mostly on the aim of that study and on
the data available, instead of on achieving compatible measures for the creative class among countries.
This was troublesome for empirical comparisons.
        Additionally, the creative class definition was accused of overlapping with the standard measure
of human capital based on educational attainment. Indeed, a close look shows that the occupations that
Florida argued to be part of the creative class require a university degree. It is not easy to find an engineer
without a bachelor’s degree, for instance. Thus, some believed that creativity does not have an
independent effect on the local economy. Once educational attainment is controlled for, the effect of
creativity might disappear, as remarked in Glaeser (2005). From here, the debate shifted to be what is the
best measure of human capital? Those that use only educational achievement, or those that measure what
people actually do, rather than what they are trained to do? In other words, which feature of human
capital, education or creativity, fosters better economic performance? This is an important question, since
it can induce policy makers to formulate strategies for human capital accumulation.
        Motivated by this debate, many articles were produced that tried to compare the measures of
education and creative class to their associations with regional and urban dynamism. For studies showing
that creativity outperforms the education indicator, Mellander and Florida (2011) used data from Sweden
to implement a structural equations approach. Analyzing for all of the Nordic countries (Denmark,
Finland, Norway and Sweden), Andersen et al. (2010) ran a simple partial correlation framework that
showed that the creative class is positively associated with employment growth, but the sign was negative
when using the education indicator. Analyzing for the U.S. context, Wojan et al. (2007) ran a cross-
section regression showing that the creative class predicts employment growth better than education.
Using employment growth as a proxy for urban dynamism, Marlet and Van Woerkens (2007) used data
from the Netherlands to find similar results. In a case of German regions, Wedemeier (2010) found that
labor productivity growth is positively affected by the creative class. In an article with the same objective,
Marracu and Paci (2012, 2013) used 27 European regions and employed a spatial error model, showing
that the creativity indicator fosters better economic performance than the education indicator.



	  
However, there were other studies that did not reach any clear conclusion of what measures outperform
the others, or that did not demonstrate that creativity is relevant to economic performance. For instance,
Florida et al. (2008) used information from China to show that neither the education nor creativity
indicator exerts a positive and significant effect on the spatial variation of technology and economic
performance. Raush and Negrey (2006), using information for the U.S., ran a cross-section to show that
the creative class has no positive association with gross product growth. Also running a cross-section for
the U.S., Donegan et al. (2008) found no statistically significant association for either indicator with
respect to employment growth. Additionally, few studies show that standard measures of human capital
based on educational achievement outperform the creative class measures. To the best of our knowledge,
only Bochma and Fritsh (2009) reached this conclusion, when analyzing the Netherlands and Germany.
       These empirical analyses can be differentiated from each other in many ways, so it is hard to make
comparisons between them. The first important difference comes from how they define regional and
urban dynamism as a dependent variable. It is possible to find studies using per-capita wages, gross
product growth, income growth, population growth or, the most widely used, employment growth. The
second main difference comes from the methodology implemented. It is possible to find papers using
cross-sectional analysis, structural equations and spatial cross-section models. The third difference comes
from distinct definitions of the creativity indicator, as mentioned above. Additionally, few studies are
implemented at the municipality level, and, to the best of our knowledge, none use panel data.
        The aim of this study is to contribute to the debate about what matters most for economic
performance—education or creativity? To do so we propose an empirical analysis of the developing
country of Brazil. The analysis for this country should be interesting, since 85% of the population are
settled in urban areas (Census 2010), there are notable regional disparities (Silveira Neto and Azzoni,
2012), the wage premium for educational attainment is high (Silveira Neto and Menezes, 2008) and there
are few studies examining the relevance of the creative class in this country1. We extract data at the
microlevel from three Brazilian censuses (1991, 2000 and 2010) and construct indicators of creativity and
education for Brazilian municipalities and a proxy for urban dynamism. We attempt to determine which
human capital measures have the highest association with municipal economic performance. The novel
contribution of this paper is the implementation of the Spatial Durbin Panel model at the urban level.
Thus we can accurately estimate of the coefficients, since we can introduce time effect, municipality
effect and spatial spillover effect. Our results show that the education indicators have a higher association
with urban dynamism than do the creativity indicators. This suggests that for the Brazilian context, it is
better for policy makers to support the attainment of higher education per se, than to focus on policies that
aim at attracting professionals in creative occupations.
        The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we discuss the database; we also explain the
spatial scope that we implement in the analysis; we discuss various measures used throughout the paper
of the creativity and education indicators, explain the urban characteristics used as the control variables
and present some descriptive analyses. In the third section we detail the methodology implemented in the
econometric approach. The fourth section shows the results. The fifth section proposes a robustness
check. The sixth section concludes the analysis. The Appendix reports the creative occupations used to
construct the creativity indicators.
2. Data and initial descriptive analysis
        In this section we explain how we constructed the analysis. First we discuss how we delimited the
spatial scope used in the investigation. Then we detail our construction of the creativity and education
indicators, show the correlations with the variables in Table 1 and discuss some possible caveats. Finally,
we propose some control variables that the literature suggests play an important role in the presence of

human capital and urban dynamism, and present a descriptive analysis in Table 2. All observations were
extracted from microlevel data of Brazilians censuses (1991, 2000 and 2010).
2.1 Spatial definition
        Bearing in mind that we intend to compare the associations of the creativity and education
indicators as conditions of urban dynamism, while controlling the spatial spillover, it is important to
define the most suitable spatial scope for our empirical investigation.
        A concern that arises in spatial analysis is to ensure that the geographical boundary delimitations
should be homogeneous over time. Historically, there have been some municipalities that received
interventions in their space delimitation. Some cities were divided into two and eventually three entities,
while others fused to become one. To account for changes in administrative boundaries during the period
of analysis, we used information on municipality border changes provided by Reis et al. (2009), namely
AMC (Áreas Mínimas Comparáveis). This municipality measure guarantees the homogeneity of the
geographical boundary delimitations throughout the period of study. However, this source only reported
until the year 2000, so we had to manually insert the AMC border changes which occurred from 2000 to
2010.
        The numbers extracted from AMC correspond to 4267 urban areas in Brazil. Bearing in mind that
Brazil is a big country, it is reasonable to expect heterogeneity among the characteristics of its
municipalities. To account for this potential problem, we imposed a restriction on the spatial scope of the
econometric analysis. We excluded municipalities from the sample that had fewer than fifty-thousand
inhabitants in Census 1991. The argument for this is to dampen a bias from unobserved variables that
emerge from heterogeneity of the populations2. This restriction resulted in shrinking our sample from
4267 administrative boundaries to only 293 each year. The hypothesis was that the 293 biggest
municipalities played an agglomerating role with respect to their neighboring areas. The urban areas
selected were located in all twenty-six states of Brazil, and included the federal district and all state
capitals.
2.2 Creativity and education indicators
       The very first attempt to measure some kind of creativity of economic agents came from the report
Creative Industries Mapping Document of DCMS (1998). After that, many others institutions started their
own research to map creative economic agents among several countries3. Unfortunately, each institution
adopted its own classification of creative industries, precluding a cross-country comparison. Moreover,
most of them are very conservative definitions, sometimes limited to sector activities with cultural traits.
    A well-known definition of creative economic agents came from Florida (2002). His specification of
the creative class is subdivided into categories of occupations which rely on innovative tasks. The two
main subdivisions are: Core Creative Occupations and Professions Creative Occupations. The Core
Creative Occupations are defined as those occupations that have the intrinsic necessity to directly employ
creativeness in their everyday routine. This subdivision includes people whose economic function is to
create new ideas, technologies and concepts. These occupations are represented by five categories:

                             •                             Computers and math;
                             •                             Architecture and engineering;
                             •                             Life, physical and social sciences;
                             •                             Education, training and library positions;
                             •                             Design work and entertainment, sports and media occupations.

  We also did the same exercise with no restriction on the sample and restricting for municipalities that had fewer than one
hundred-thousand inhabitants in Census 1991. The results are available upon request.

  For instance, a newsletter is published on the U.S. named Creative Industries: Business & Employment in the Arts.

	  
In many studies a fifth category of bohemian occupations is also treated4. The subdivision of Professions
Creative Occupations is defined as those occupations that border the Core Creative Occupations. They are
occupations in which arise a considerable number of complex problems demanding a high degree of
discernment in making decisions independently, thus requiring a high level of education and/or
professional experience. These occupations are represented by six categories:

                             •                             Management occupations;
                             •                             Business and financial operations;
                             •                             Legal positions;
                             •                             Healthcare practitioners;
                             •                             Technical occupations;
                             •                             High-end sales and sales management.
    One important concern about the definition of creativity is how it overlaps with the measures of
human capital based on educational attainment. Indeed, most of the proposals for a definition of creative
class are based on occupations in which the individuals have a high likelihood of holding a university
degree. Many studies fail to disentangle the overlapping problem because they don't have detailed
microlevel information on the educational attainment and current occupation of each individual.
Fortunately, we can solve this problem straightforwardly because we can extract that information from
each Brazilian Demographic census.
    This paper partially adopts the description of creativity suggested by Florida (2002). We assume only
the Core Creative Occupations subdivision as the scope of this study for creativity. The first reason to do
this is that people in these professions have to directly implement creativity in their everyday tasks. The
second reason is that many scholars argue that Florida's definition is too vague (Markusen, 2006; Wojan
et al., 2007). Thus, we choose the occupations which are more often addressed in the economic literature
(Marrocu and Paci, 2012, 2013). The last reason but not the least is that if one takes a close look at the
Professions Creative Occupations he/she straightway concludes that they overlap the standard measure of
human capital based on educational attainment.
    We used the Classificação de Ocupações Para Pesquisas Domiciliares (COD) 2010 from IBGE to
determine which jobs illustrate the creative class in Brazil. For compatibility among the censuses of 1991,
2000 and 2010, we converted them to occupations defined in CIUO-88 and CIUO-08, which are two
versions of a tool for the international comparison of job descriptions from the International Labor
Organization (ILO)5.
The creativity and education indicators were constructed as proportions of each category with relation to
the populations of the AMC. Following the previous contributions of Marrocu and Paci (2012, 2013), we
developed creative class and education indicators defined by five categories:

                             •                             Graduates;
                             •                             Noncreative graduates;
                             •                             Creatives;
                             •                             Creative graduates;
                             •                             Bohemians;
where Creatives represents individuals that are in one of four Core Creative categories: computers and
math; architecture and engineering; life, physical, and social sciences; and education, training, and library
positions. The occupations selected for these categories can be seen in Tables 10, 11, 12 and 13 in the
Appendix. Creative graduates represents only the individuals that are in one of the occupations above and
additionally hold a bachelor’s degree. Graduates are the individuals that hold a bachelor’s degree

         See for instance Boschma and Fritsch (2009), Marlet and Van Woerkens (2007) and Marrocu and Paci (2012).
5
         A complete definition of the occupations defined as the creative class is presented in the Appendix.
	  
regardless of profession. Noncreative graduates represents the individuals that hold a bachelor’s degree
but do not have a job in the creative class. Finally, bohemians represents the individuals that are in the
Core Creative category of design work and entertainment, sports, and media occupations. The
occupations selected for the bohemians can be seen in Table 14 in the Appendix.
        In Table 1 we show the correlations between the five indicators of education and creativity for
each census. We can see that with time, the proportion of individuals in creative occupations with a
bachelor’s degree increases. This suggests that in the Brazilian context it is more difficult nowadays to
find an individual doing creative tasks without higher education. The same pattern can be seen in relation
of graduates and non-creative graduates. On the other hand, the correlation between bohemians and
creatives does not change too much over time.
        The correlation coefficients depicted in Table 1 reveal an obstacle to econometric analysis. Since
there is a huge parallel between the creativity and education indicators, because of strong
multicollinearity problems, it is not appropriate to introduce all variables at the same time in a regression
analysis. Thus, considering that there is robust literature showing that human capital plays an important
role in economic growth6, and the creativity and education indicators are proxy for human capital, we
decided to run separate regressions for these two variables and to control for potential bias associated
with omitted variables by using additional covariates as regressors and spatial fixed-effect econometric
specifications.
2.3 Urban characteristics
        In this subsection we explain some control variables included in the empirical analysis that can
affect the creativity and education indicators as well as urban dynamism. The first characteristic that
might be relevant to the share of human capital in a municipality is population size. On the one hand, the
larger the population the higher the probability of services and goods differentiation (Quigley, 1998). This
might affect the presence of creative and educated people since such individuals have on average higher
income and thus more ability to afford specific services and goods. On the other hand, population size can
also suggest congestion, which may repel high productivity people (Tsekeris and Geroliminis, 2013; Su,
2011). Moreover, the larger the population, the higher the probability of the agglomeration effect
occurring in neighboring urban areas. Therefore, municipalities that are closer to major centers have a
higher likelihood to attract creative and educated people.
       The second characteristic that might be relevant to the share of creative and educated people is the
average income per capita. As higher productivity means higher wages, there must be a connection
between the proportion of human capital and the average income in a municipality. To control for this
argument, this variable was also included in the analyses7.

        Table 1 - Correlations Between Variables of the Creative Class and Human Capital




        The third characteristic relies on Florida’s hypotheses of the positive effect of tolerance
environment on the presence of creative people. The more open the minds of the inhabitants of one
municipality, the more fuel for creative and innovate practices. The argument for this relation depends on
low entry barriers for creative capital. Regularly scholars address tolerance as a matter of diversity.
Municipalities with more diverse individuals may exert better conditions for the generation of new ideas,
and consequently employ influence on the presence of creative people (Inglehart and Norris, 2003;
Welzel and Inglehart, 2013; Florida, 2002; Golgher, 2011). The technology and talent have been mostly
seen as stock variables which accumulate in urban areas and have effect on regional economic growth.
However, for some scholars both technology and talent are flow variables. The ability to capture these
flows requires an understanding of tolerance, the open-minded environment and diversity. This suggests
that there is a connection between diversity and productivity (Ottaviano and Peri, 2005; Page, 2008;
Longhi, 2011). Several papers use the composition of different national origins of its inhabitants as a


	  
proxy for urban tolerance 8. Following this assumption, we construct our proxy for tolerance and
diversity, which we assume to correspond with the share of foreign people. The control variable is
calculated by the proportion of people originally from different countries instead Brazil in relation to the
total population of each municipality.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Table 2 - Summary of Statistics




        The last urban characteristic that may be relevant to the share of human capital in a municipality is
the size of the university environment (Florida et al., 2006, 2008). First, since universities always stay in
the vanguard of technological innovation, they can attract startup firms. Second, university environments
act as a magnet both directly for students, teachers and researchers, and indirectly for highly skilled
entrepreneurs who want to take advantage of the academic resources. The third reason relies on the
assumption that academic environments enhance tolerance and diversity in a community, attracting
students and faculty with a wide variety of racial, ethnic and national backgrounds. Finally, the fourth
reason counts on a possible neighbor effect. Municipalities located near academic environments have a
higher probability of taking advantage of their spillover effects. Thus, we construct a proxy for the

        Table 2 presents a descriptive analysis of the database. It is possible to see that in the period
analyzed an expansion occurred in the purchasing power of Brazilian citizens living in big cities. The
average income growth was almost 59%. The foreign share was a really small part of the population and
remained basically stagnant. The college share increased significantly over time. The initial levels of the
creatives in 1991 and 2000 did not change much. Nor did those of the creative graduates or bohemians.
However, the initial levels in 1991 and 2000 of the graduates and non-creative graduates increased
slightly.
3. Empirical model specification
        The main contribution of the model specifications is the simultaneous introduction of controls for
time effect, municipality fixed effect and spatial spillover effect in the econometric analysis. As we have
information about the growth of employment for each municipality over two periods, we can implement a
Spatial Durbin Panel Model. Such an approach takes account of variabilities in time trends, municipalities
and spaces. Specifically, we consider the following econometric specification:
𝑦 = 𝜌 𝐼! ⊗ 𝑊 𝑦 + 𝐼! ⊗ 𝑊 𝑋𝜃 +   𝑋𝛽 + 𝜄 ⊗ 𝐼! 𝜇 + ℰ                                                        (1)
where ℰ = 𝜎 𝐼! ⊗ 𝑊 ℰ + 𝜈.
Here 𝑦 is a vector 𝑛𝑡×1  of observations of the employment growth rate of n cities (n = 1, 2, ..., 293) for t
periods of time (1991-2000 and 2000-2010); 𝑋 is a matrix of explanatory variables (which includes one
of the five proxies for educated people and the creative class, as well as the control variables for
population, average income per capita, share of foreign individuals and share of college students) of
length 𝑛𝑡×𝐾; 𝑊 is a matrix 𝑛×𝑛 of spatial weights; 𝜌 is the coefficient of the spatial correlation for the
endogenous variable; 𝐼! is an identity matrix 𝑡×𝑡 ; 𝐼! is an identity matrix 𝑛×𝑛 ; 𝜄 is a vector 𝑡×1  of
ones; 𝜇 is a vector of unobserved, fixed, specific characteristics of each region of dimension 𝑛×1; 𝜎 is the
coefficient of the spatial correlation of the error term; ℰ is a vector of 𝑛𝑡×1  spatially correlated
innovations with ℰ~𝑁(0, 𝜎ℰ! ); and 𝜈 is a vector 𝑛𝑡×1  of idiosyncratic errors with   𝜈~𝑁(0, 𝜎!! ). We will
suppose that the vector 𝜀 is uncorrelated with the explanatory variables or with vector  𝜇. The symbol ⊗
represents the Kronecker product.
        Note that the model includes spatial lags for employment growth, the explanatory variable and the
control variables; and it includes spatial dependence in the error term as well. These factors imply that
different kinds of spatial interaction may be involved in the determination of urban dynamism. More
specifically, the presence of the spatial lag of the endogenous variable represents a control for a
potentially omitted, spatially correlated variable that affects the employment growth. The presence of the
city’s neighbors variable simply captures spatial spillovers of the effects of these variables. Finally, the
spatial dependence of the error represents unexpected or irregular, spatially correlated shocks. In addition,
by using a panel model, we allow for the existence of a heterogeneous process of employment generation
across the cities. As argued by Baltagi (2005), panel data exhibit greater variability and a lower degree of
collinearity among variables, and provide more efficient estimators. We estimate the parameters of
equation (1) by the maximum likelihood approach suggested by Millo and Piras (2012). The estimation
utilizes a concentrated likelihood function and an interactive process to obtain the values of parameters  𝜌,
𝛽, 𝜃, 𝜎ℰ! and 𝜎!! .

        Analysis of the parameters of the indicators of creativity and education in spatial models that
include spatial lags of employment growth become complicated and require special interpretation,
because a change in the measures of education or creativity for a single municipality can potentially affect
the employment growth in all other municipalities (LeSage and Page, 2008). Thus, the impact of the
creativity and education indicators includes the effects of feedback loops where municipality 𝑖 affects
municipality 𝑗, which in turn affects municipality 𝑖, as well as longer paths which might go from
municipalities 𝑖 and 𝑗 to 𝑘 and back to 𝑖 again, with 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗, 𝑗 ≠ 𝑘 and 𝑖 ≠ 𝑘. This is a clear consequence in
our suggested model, since we included 𝑊𝑦!" and 𝑊𝑋!" in the right-hand side of equation (1).

	  
          More formally, if we rewrite equation (1) as
                           !!
𝑦 = 𝐼!" − 𝜌 𝐼! ⊗ 𝑊               𝐼! ⊗ 𝑊 𝑋𝜃 +   𝑋𝛽 + 𝜄 ⊗ 𝐼! 𝜇 + 𝜀                                          (2)
and take the partial derivative of y with respect to the explanatory variable of the indicator of creativity or
education, let’s say 𝑥! , we get
   !"                       !!
!!!
        = 𝐼!" − 𝜌 𝐼! ⊗ 𝑊          𝐼! ⊗ 𝑊 𝜃! +    𝐼!" 𝛽!                                                   (3)

As is clear, the resulting expression is not equal to 𝛽! as in the least-square. Instead, the resulting
expression is matrix 𝑛𝑡  𝑥  𝑛𝑡. The elements of the diagonal of this matrix represent the direct impact of the
indicator of creativity or education of municipality 𝑖 on the employment growth of municipality 𝑖. The
elements of the matrix that are outside the diagonal represent the indirect impact on municipality j of
variation in the employment growth of municipality 𝑖 in response to changes in the indicators of creativity
or education. As the indirect and direct impacts can be different among municipalities, Pace and LeSage
(2008) proposed measures of direct and indirect impact as the average of the elements inside and outside
of the diagonal of the matrix, respectively.
4. Creativity and education indicators impacting on urban dynamism
       The aim of this section is to provide an estimation of the association between the creativity and
education indicators and urban dynamism in Brazil, measured by employment growth. The idea is to
contribute to the debate about which proxy for human capital is the best predictor of Brazilian urban
employment growth. The novel contribution of this paper is the introduction in the same regression
analysis of controls for time effect, municipality fixed effect and spatial spillover effects. Two recent
papers have already found some spatial dependence of income at the microregion and municipality levels
in Brazil (Resende, 2011, and Cravo et al., 2014), but to the best of our knowledge, there is no paper
analyzing the same issue using a spatial fixed-effect model.
        In Table 3 we present the coefficients estimated using the Ordinary Least Square estimator for all
of the observations (columns (1), (3) and (5)) and using the concentrated maximum likelihood and
interactive approach for the Spatial Durbin Panel model represented in equation (1) (columns (2), (4) and
(6)). Columns (1) and (2) present estimations using the creative class as the variable of interest. Columns
(3) and (4) present estimations when restricting the creative class to only those individuals holding a
bachelor’s degree. Columns (5) and (6) present estimations considering a third indicator of creativity: in
them only bohemian occupations are considered.
         The set of evidence of Table 3 indicates significant differences between the OLS estimates and the
spatial panel ones. Particularly, note that both estimates of the spatial parameters are positive and
statistically significant, a result that is in line with Resende (2012) and Cravo et al. (2014), the most
recent studies for Brazilian cities and microregions. We can thus identify different kinds of spatial
dependence for the growth of employment in Brazilian cities and cannot rely on the traditional OLS
estimator when analyzing employment dynamism for cities.
        In fact, when we introduce the spatial spillover effect, municipality effect and year effect, the
share of the creative occupations appears to have a positive and significant association with urban
dynamism. This result is opposed to the coefficient obtained when using the standard Ordinary Least
Square approach. The coefficient of the share of the creative individuals with a bachelor’s degree is also
positive, but with a smaller association than the share of the creatives, and with no significance. This
result must be due to the very small variability in this category, since the creative graduates are a very
small part of the graduates. For instance, the mean initial value of this category in 1991 is only 0.43% of
the population with standard deviation 0.47%. However, this result differs from Marracu and Paci (2012,
2013), who found this category to be the highest predictor of regional dynamism. The last creativity
indicator is the share of the bohemians, which is presented in columns (5) and (6).

	  
        Regarding the control variables, we note a negative coefficient for initial populations and a
positive one for the share of college students in the populations of the cities. The first result suggests that,
ever more equal, small cities present a higher employment growth rate than big cities in Brazil, a result
that is consistent with the decreasing life quality in the big cities. The second result is similar to the one
obtained by Da Matta et al. (2007) and suggests that the human capital in the urban environment presents
benefits for urban dynamism.
           Table 3: Associations Between Creativity Indicators and the Urban Dynamism




        In Table 4, we present the results using indicators of educational attainment instead of the creative
class. Columns (1) and (2) show the results of the standard Ordinary Least Square approach and the
Spatial Durbin Panel model, respectively, using indicators of the education of the graduates. Similarly,
columns (3) and (4) show the results for the non-creative graduates. With respect to educational
attainment, we can see that the share of the graduates has the highest statistically significant, positive
coefficient among all of the indicators analyzed. This result suggests that for the Brazilian context,

	  
Florida's creative class contribution is not as relevant as the widely used measure of human capital based
on education level. For an additional comparative analysis between the creativity and education indicators
as conditions of urban dynamism, we did the same exercise for the noncreative graduates. This
examination helps to avoid the overlap problems between the education and creativity indicators. Again
the coefficient is positive and significant and higher than that of the creative class. Overall, Tables 3 and 4
show that the indicators of education have a higher association with urban dynamism than do the
indicators of creativity.
               Table 4: Associations Between Education Indicators and Urban Dynamism




       It is important to note that the introduction of municipality fixed effect shrinks the power of
explanation of the control variables income per capita, share of foreign individuals and share of college
students. Nevertheless, the spatial coefficients remain imperative in the analysis. This suggests that the
introduction of municipality fixed effect and spatial spillover effect are powerful. Moreover, municipality
population size appears to have a negative effect on urban dynamism, perhaps owing to congestion
	  
problems as discussed above, but it seems to have a positive indirect effect, suggesting spillover
influence.
         By calculating the total, direct, and indirect effects of neighbors we can measure the influence of
spatial dependence more precisely, as pointed out by LeSage and Pace (2008). Table 5 shows the results
for each indicator of creativity and education used in the spatial panel model. As we can see, the presence
of creative individuals has a positive association with urban dynamism for both the direct and indirect
effects. Consequently, the total effect of the creative class appears to be positive and significant. The
creative graduates have different signs for the direct and indirect effects, but a negative total effect which
is not statistically significant. The bohemian indicator has negative indirect and direct effects which are
statistically significant. The indicators of education, represented by graduates and noncreative graduates,
show positive direct and indirect effects, and both have higher total effects than any creativity indicator.
These results strongly suggest that in the Brazilian context, education matters more than creativity to
urban dynamism.
       Our empirical analyses present different results from those found by Marlet and Van Woerkens
(2007, 2004) and Mellander and Florida (2011) that identified a stronger correlation between regional
growth and creative measures. Our results are also distinct from the findings of Marrocu and Paci (2012,
2013), who encountered a stronger correlation between regional growth and the subset of the creative
class with higher education attainment.

                               on urban dynamism: direct, indirect and

5. Robustness Checks
       In this section we check if the results above are robust with the inclusion of additional control
variables and use of an alternative spatial weights matrix. More specifically, as we are dealing with the
dependent variable that represents employment growth, we first examine if our results are explained by
the productive structure of the cities. Secondly, we inspect the robustness of our results using a different
matrix of spatial weights; this could be decisive if, for instance, the creative and education indicators
presented different levels of spatial interaction.
	  
        The production structure of each municipality may play an important role in urban dynamism. It is
plausible that the initial conditions of the labor market are correlated with the composition of the creative
class occupations and other graduates within each municipality. In the case that our municipality fixed
effect does not capture all of this impact, our coefficients may not be estimated with a high degree of
accuracy. Therefore, we introduced in the Spatial Durbin Panel model variables to control for the
municipal production structure. We measured the shares employed in industry sector, service sector, and
public sector. Here we do not look at what is the routine task of each employed person. We just look at
which sector he/she is working in to capture the production configuration of the municipality. This
mechanism enables us to control for the initial conditions of the labor market and rule out potential
coefficient bias associated to economic structure of the cities.
        Table 6 shows the results for this robustness check. Again, among the creativity indicators, only
the creatives measure has a positive and significant effect. However, the indicators of education still have
a higher association with urban dynamism than creativity. Therefore, we can conclude that our results are
robust for municipality production structure. It is worth noting that, as expected, the unemployed share is
highly correlated with employment growth, since these are potentially employed in the long run.
Moreover, the coefficient of the college share is always positive-significant, reinforcing the importance of
educational attainment to urban dynamism. In relation to the production sector, the business and service
sectors have a positive association with urban dynamism, while the public sector has a negative one.
        For the spatial models in the previous section, we used a row-standardized spatial weights matrix
which accounted for the inverse distance squared between all possible pairs of municipalities. However,
Brazil is a huge country, and pairs are sometimes so distant that it does not make sense to consider spatial
spillover between them. To account for this possible problem, we suggest an alternative spatial weights
matrix as a robustness check, a row-standardized spatial weights matrix for the five nearest neighbors.
The idea is to put all of the spatial weight in the very close municipalities. Thus, the spillover effect is
limited to a few pairs of municipalities.

        Using this spatial weights matrix we ran the spatial panel model for each creativity and education
indicator again. For a sense of brevity, we suppressed the coefficients of the control variables from the
results table. Table 7 shows the results of the spatial panel model for creatives, creative graduates,
graduates, noncreative graduates and bohemians in columns (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), respectively. As we
can see, the sign and significance of the results remain the same. However, the distance dampened
between the coefficients of the education and creativity indicators. Furthermore, the magnitude of the
creatives coefficient increased, while those of the graduates and noncreative graduates decreased slightly.

        To be sure that the education indicators remain presenting higher impacts on urban dynamism than
the creativity indicators, we calculate the total, direct, and indirect effects of neighborhood for both
models. Columns (1), (2) and (3) of Table 8 show the results for direct, indirect and total effects with
additional controls for production structure for each municipality. Here, the direct effect of graduates and
noncreative graduates on municipality employment growth is still higher than the measures of creativity.
However, the introduction of many controls increases the noise of the indirect effect, which cancels out
the significance of the total effect of the graduate indicator. Nevertheless, the total effect of the
noncreative graduates remains the only positive and significant result. Columns (4), (5) and (6) of Table 8
show the results for the direct, indirect and total effects of the model using the five nearest neighbors
spatial weights matrix. The gap between the total effects of the creativity and education indicators
actually widens, reinforcing the conclusion that for Brazil it is better for policy makers to support the
accumulation of higher education per se, than focus on policies that aim at attracting professionals in a
specific field, such as the creative class.

6. Conclusion
       This study follows the debate initiated by Florida (2002) and Glaeser (2005) about what measures
of human capital are better predictors of economic performance. Our intent is to contribute an empirical
analysis of how urban dynamism in Brazil is correlated with worker abilities based on creativity and/or
educational levels. This analysis should help policy makers decide what is the best strategy to support the
accumulation of human capital.
        Using microlevel data extracted from Brazilian censuses (1991, 2000 and 2010), we selected the
293 biggest municipalities and computed the urban characteristics that might simultaneously affect the
presence of human capital and urban dynamism. Following the definition of creative class from Florida
(2002) and adding the contribution of Marrocu and Paci (2012), we constructed five indicators for
creativity and education: creatives, creative graduates, graduates, noncreative graduates and bohemians.
Aware of the trade-off between omitted variable bias and multicollinearity problems, our analysis relies
on the previous literature that shows the role of human capital in economic performance, and proposes to
compare the coefficients of the creativity and education indicators as mere conditions of urban dynamism,
instead of interpreting them as causes.
        Besides cross-section regression and spatial cross-section analysis, which have been widely
implemented in the literature, our paper goes further and proposes a Spatial Durbin Panel analysis. Thus,
we control for time effect, municipality fixed effect and spatial spillover effect. We also measure the
influence of spatial dependence more precisely by calculating the total, direct, and indirect effects of
neighbor-city characteristics on the presence of the creative class and educated workers. As a robustness
check, we include more independent variables to control for the production structure of each
municipality. Additionally, we propose an alternative spatial weights matrix that increases the influence
of the nearest municipalities.
        The results prove that human capital plays an important role in employment growth at the
municipality level in Brazil. Moreover, the comparison between the creativity and education indicator
coefficients suggests that for the Brazilian context it is better for policy makers to support the
	  
accumulation of higher education per se, than to focus on policies that aim at attracting professionals in a
specific field such as the creative class. This result contradicts the hypothesis of Florida (2002) and
clashes with other empirical findings in Marlet and Van Woerkens (2004, 2007), Mellander and Florida
(2011) and Marrocu and Paci (2012, 2013), for instance. Thus, It appears that, in Brazilian case, before
the idea of attracting creative professionals, local governments must to try to attract more educated
migrants and to improve local schooling.
