Abstract: The objective of the present paper is to show that the macroeconomic performance of
Brazilian economy in the last 12 years was mainly the result of shocks in terms of trade, where the
exceptional improvement in the terms of trade occurred from 2006 was a major cause of over-
valuation of real exchange rate, but also contributed to maintain inflation rate at low levels, to increase
real wages and to reduce unemployment rate to a historically very low level. The exchange rate over-
valuation that was caused by the improvement in terms of trade was a driving force in the process of
de-industrialization of Brazilian economy from 2006 on, since it induced a substitution of domestic
production for imports, which explains the stagnation of industrial output after 2011 in a context of
growing domestic absorption. This means that Brazil had very clear symptoms of “Dutch Disease”.
The recession that started in Brazil in the last quarter of 2014 was mainly the reflection of a negative
shock in terms of trade, which resulted in inflation acceleration, decreasing real wages and growing
unemployment rate. The positive side of this scenario is that real exchange rate returned to a
competitive level in the second semester of 2015, which can give a start in a possible re-
industrialization of Brazilian economy.

Resumo: O objetivo reside em mostrar que o desempenho macroeconômico da economia brasileira
nos últimos 12 anos foi principalmente o resultado de choques nos termos de troca. Nota-se que a
variável termos de troca foi uma das principais causas do excesso de valorização da taxa de câmbio
real, mas que também contribuiu para manter a taxa de inflação em níveis baixos, auxiliou no aumento
dos salários reais e na redução da taxa de desemprego para um nível historicamente baixo. A sobre-
apreciação da taxa de câmbio que foi causada pela melhoria dos termos de troca foi uma força motriz
na processo de desindustrialização da economia brasileira após 2006, uma vez que induziu a
substituição da produção doméstica por importações, o que explica a estagnação da produção
industrial após 2011, em um contexto de crescente absorção doméstica. Isso significa que o Brasil
tinha sintomas claros de "Doença Holandesa". A recessão que começou no Brasil no último trimestre
de 2014 foi principalmente o reflexo de um choque negativo nos termos de troca, resultando na
aceleração da inflação, quada dos salários reais e crescente taxa de desemprego.

       1 – Introduction.

        From 2003 to 2010 Brazilian economy experienced a period of high growth rates with
moderate levels of inflation. Average growth rate of GDP was 4.06% p.y during this period and the
average rate of CPI growth was 5.79% p.y. This relatively good macroeconomic performance
changed dramatically after 2011. Average growth rate was reduced to 1.59% p.y in the period 2011-
2014, a reduction of almost 61% in average growth compared to the previous period. At the same
time inflation accelerated to 6.17% p.y. Moreover, for the period 2015-2016 market forecasts for
GDP growth showed a contraction of almost 8% in real output, at the same time that average inflation
should rose to 7.5% p.y. This dramatic change in macroeconomic performance was mainly due to the
stagnation of industrial output which started at the end of 2010. The combined effects of chronic
exchange rate overvaluation - due to improvement in terms of trade - and profit squeeze - due to the
wage growth above productivity growth - resulted in a fast reduction of external competitiveness of
Brazilian manufacturing sector, inducing a substitution of domestic output for imports. Moreover, the
reduction of profit rate in manufacturing sector, due to the reduction in profit margins, resulted in a
contraction of investment in new machines and equipment, worsening the productivity problem of
Brazilian manufacturing sector. Federal Government in Brazil tried to solve this problem by the
implementation of a new macroeconomic regime, the so-called New Macroeconomic Matrix. This
macroeconomic regime was characterized by an easing of fiscal and monetary policies in order to
increase aggregate demand. From the second semester of 2011 to the first semester of 2013, nominal
interest rates were reduced as well as taxes over manufactured products. The result was a very modest
increase in growth rate of GDP in 2013 in comparison with 2012, at expense of inflation acceleration
and a reduction in the primary surplus of federal government (Oreiro, 2015). In the second semester
of 2013, due to inflationary pressures, Brazilian Central Bank started a process of adjustment in
monetary policy, increasing the level of nominal interest rate. This change in monetary policy resulted
– combined with the uncertainty generated by the political scandal of corruption inside PETROBRAS
– in a growth deceleration in 2014, when Brazilian economy showed a growth rate of only 0.1%. The
combined effects of tax reduction, growth deceleration and increase in interest rates resulted in a huge
worsening of fiscal position of public sector. Indeed, the primary surplus of 1.8% of GDP in 2013
was transformed into a primary deficit of almost 0.7%. Moreover the nominal deficit increase to
almost 7% of GDP at the end of 2014, starting from a level of 3,26% in November of 2013. As a
result of worsening of fiscal position of public sector, Federal Government, in the beginning of 2015,
had to start a fiscal adjustment, designed to stop the continuous increase in the ratio of public debt to
GDP. This change in the fiscal policy, combined with a very tight monetary policy had contributed
to worsen the growth perspectives of Brazilian economy. After a fall of almost 4% of real GDP in
2015, the consensus among analysts of the financial sector is that Brazilian economy will show a
contraction of 3% in 2016. The objective of the present paper is to show that the macroeconomic
performance of Brazilian economy in the last 12 years was mainly the result of shocks in terms of
trade, where the exceptional improvement in the terms of trade occurred from 2006 was a major cause
of overvaluation of real exchange rate, but also contributed to maintain inflation rate at low levels, to
increase real wages and to reduce unemployment rate to a historically very low level. The exchange
rate overvaluation that was caused by the improvement in terms of trade was a driving force in the
process of de-industrialization of Brazilian economy from 2006 on, since it induced a substitution of
domestic production for imports, which explains the stagnation of industrial output after 2011 in a
context of growing domestic absorption. This means that Brazil had very clear symptoms of “Dutch
Disease”. The recession that started in Brazil in the last quarter of 2014 was mainly the reflection of
a negative shock in terms of trade, which resulted in inflation acceleration, decreasing real wages and
growing unemployment rate. The positive side of this scenario is that real exchange rate returned to
a competitive level in the second semester of 2015, which can give a start in a possible re-
industrialization of Brazilian economy. The article is organized in five sections, including the
introduction. In Section 2 we present our theoretical framework, which is a three goods version of the
Dependent Economy Macroeconomic Model. In Section 3 we made a descriptive analysis of
                                                                                                       2
macroeconomic performance of Brazilian economy from 2003 to 2015. In section 4 we made present
some empirical evidence regarding the role of terms of trade shocks in the macroeconomic
performance of Brazilian economy through the use of correlation analysis and multivariate time
series. In section 5 we present a brief summary of the conclusions.
  2 – Terms of Trade, Real Exchange Rate and Real Wages in a Dependent Economy Model
        In this section we will present a three goods dependent economy macroeconomic model based
on Agenor-Montiel (1999) in order to analyze the effects of changes in terms of trade over real
exchange rate and real wage of medium-income countries that are rich in natural resources as Brazil.
Although the standard macroeconomic model for small open economies is the Mundell-Fleming
version of IS-LM, this framework is not suited to discuss the effects of changes in terms or trade since
it assumes an economy that specializes in the production of a single (composite) good, which is
imperfect substitute for the single (composite) good that produced in the rest of the world (Agenor-
Montiel, 1999, p.52). In this setting there is no possible way to distinguish between terms of trade
and real exchange rate. In order to do that it is necessary to introduce a three sector economy model
with two tradable sectors and one no-tradable sector. Real exchange rate will be defined as the ratio
between price of tradable and non-tradable goods, and terms of trade will be the ratio between export
and import prices of tradeable goods. Terms of trade will be exogenous to domestic economy, which
gives rise to its “dependent” nature. The model to be presented bellow can solved in order to show a
full-employment (classical) or unemployment (Keynesian) equilibrium. Since the qualitative effects
of changes of trade over real exchange rate and output composition does not depend on the type of
equilibrium, we will focus our analysis only on the full-employment equilibrium.
        Let us consider a dependent economy that had three sectors ℎ = (𝑥, 𝑖, 𝑛): a tradable sector
that produces a good that can´t be consumed in domestic markets (primary sector), another tradable
sector that produces a good that can be consumed either in domestic or external markets
(manufacturing) and a non-tradable sector (services). The output of each sector is supposed to be a
function of the quantity of labor employed, which is the only input used in production. Production
technology of each sector is given by:
                                               𝑦ℎ = 𝑦ℎ (𝑛ℎ ) (1)

       Supposing that in all sectors firms operate in conditions of perfect competition and firms to
be profit-maximizers, the aggregate labor demand in each sector is given by:

Where: 𝜃 =        is the term of trade; 𝑧 = 𝑝 𝑖 is the real exchange rate and 𝜔 = 𝑝 is the real wage rate.

goods is taken to depend on the relative prices of the two goods, given by the real exchange rate, and
on the total domestic absorption measured in terms of manufactured goods, 𝑎 , given by:
                                                    𝑎𝑛
                                         𝑎 = 𝑎𝑖 +         (4)
                                                     𝑧
        Let us suppose that the real domestic absorption of both manufactured and non-tradeable
goods is given by:
                                            𝑎 = 𝑎(𝜃; 𝑔)   (5)
                                                                     𝜕𝑎          𝜕𝑎
       Where: 𝑔 is the real value of government expenditure and           > 0;        > 0 .Thus absorption
                                                                     𝜕𝜃          𝜕𝑔
depends positively on the terms of trade as well as on the shift parameter g. From equations (4) and
(5) we can see that an increase in government expenditures and/or an improvement in terms of trade
will result in an increase in domestic absorption. Changes in real exchange rate can displace domestic
absorption from manufacturing to service sector and vice-versa, being one of the fundamental
determinants of composition of output. Market-clearing in the non-tradable sector is:
                                                          𝜕𝑦𝑛

        Trade balance measured in units of manufacturing goods is given by:
                                             𝜔
                                    𝑏 = 𝜃𝑦𝑥 ( ) + 𝑦𝑖 (𝜔) − 𝑎𝑖 (𝑧, 𝑎) (7)
                                             𝜃
        Regarding the labor market, we will suppose that supply of labor is inelastic and equal to 𝑛̅.
This means that full employment condition is given by:
                                          𝜔
                                𝑛̅ = 𝑛𝑥𝑑 ( ) + 𝑛𝑖𝑑 (𝜔) + 𝑛𝑛𝑑 (𝑧𝜔) (8)
                                          𝜃
        In order to solve the model, we will suppose that terms of trade are exogenous, being
determined in the international markets. Being so, the model has three independent equations [(6)-
(8)] with three endogenous variables: z, 𝜔 and b. The system of equation is determinate. Putting (5)
into (6) and taking the total derivative of the resulting equation we get:
                              𝑦𝑛´ 𝑧          𝑎𝑛,2 (𝜕𝑎⁄𝜕𝜃)        𝑎𝑛,2 (𝜕𝑎⁄𝜕𝑔)
                𝑑𝑧 = − ´               𝑑𝜔 + ´              𝑑𝜃 + ´             𝑑𝑔 (9)

        From equation (9) we can derive the slope of NN curve, that is the loci of all combinations of
real exchange rate and real wage rate for which there is market for non-tradable goods clears. Taking
𝑑𝜃 = 𝑑𝑔 = 0 in (9) we arrive at:
                                     𝑑𝑧         𝑦𝑛´ 𝑧

       It is straightforward to see that:
                                               𝜕𝑎
                                      𝑑𝑍 𝑎𝑛,2 ( ⁄𝜕𝜃)

        That is for a given real wage rate, an improvement in terms of trade will result in an
appreciation of real exchange rate. In order to restore market clearing it is necessary to increase the
level of output for non-tradeable goods. Since the real product wage in the non-tradeable sector is
given by 𝑧𝜔, then real exchange rate has to appreciate, reducing the real product wage and thereby
increasing the profit-maximizing level of employment. This will increase the level of output in the
non-tradeable sector, eliminating the excess demand for non-tradable goods. Returning to the full-
employment condition, taking the total derivative of equation (8) we get:
                                                                                                        4

        An improvement in the terms of trade, holding real exchange rate constant, will produce an
increase in the level of real wage. Equations (9b) and (10b) show that an improvement in terms of
trade is associated with a real exchange appreciation and an increase in the level of real wages, which
can be seen in Figure 1.

         Figure 1: Effects of a Positive Terms-of-Trade-Shock in the Three-Good Dependent Economy Model.
        This occurs because an improvement in terms of trade cause a reduction of real product wage
in the primary sector, increasing the labor demand and real output of this sector. Since economy is
working at full employment, in order to increase output in the primary sector, workers had to be
transferred from the manufacturing and service sectors, what will require an increase in the real wage
paid in the primary sector. Due to the fact labor is supposed to be a homogenous input and also due
to the hypothesis of perfect mobility of labor between sectors, an increase in the real wage in the
primary sector will result in an increase of real wage in the manufacturing and service sector as well.
Due to the increase in real wages, real output and employment of the manufacturing sector will be
reduced, given rise to a classic problem of “Dutch Disease”2.
                     3 – Macroeconomic Performance of Brazilian Economy (2003-2015)
        This section presents first a descriptive analysis of the temporal variables real exchange rate,
terms of trade, real wages, the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP), share of the gross fixed
capital formation on GDP, share industry GDP on GDP, unemployment, inflation, real interest rates,
share of the public sector borrowing requirements on GDP, international reserves and external
accounts in the period 2003-2015, during the administrations of Presidents Luis Inacio Lula da Silva

           3.1 – Real Exchange Rate Over-Valuation under Lula Government, 2003-2010
        From the first quarter of 2003 to the last quarter of 2005, real exchange rate presented an
appreciation of 33.98% (Figure 2). According to some studies about exchange rate misalignment, as
the one of Oreiro, Punzo and Araujo (2012), real exchange rate in Brazil started to become overvalued
in second quarter of 2004, reaching a level of 18% of overvaluation in the last quarter of 2007. In
2006, Central Bank of Brazil begun to make sterilized interventions in exchange rate market by means
of buying an enormous quantity of international reserves and sterilizing its effects over high powered
money by selling Treasury bonds in Repurchase Agreements (Repo) operations. The consequence
were the international reserves had grown at a rate of 50.7% in 2006 and 97.98% in 2007, reaching
more than US$ 206 Billion in September of 2008 (Figure 4); while Repo increased from 1.7% of
GDP in 2005 to 10.4% of GDP in 2008. This huge accumulation of international reserves meant that
the free floating exchange rate regime was substituted by a de facto managed exchange rate regime,
although without an explicit or even an implicit target for nominal exchange rate. The objective of
the new exchange rate regime seemed to be to reduce and eventually stop the process of real exchange
rate appreciation3. Indeed, the pace of exchange rate appreciation was greatly reduced after 2006.
Between 2003.Q1 to 2005.Q4, real exchange rate depreciated 33.98%, this rhythm of appreciation
was reduced to just 8.06% in the period 2006.Q1 to 2008.Q3.
        It is also important to notice that export performance of Brazilian economy until 2005.Q3 was
not due to an improvement in the Terms of Trade. As we can see in Figure 2, from the first 2003.Q1
until 2005.Q3, the index of terms of trade remained almost constant around a level of 95. A modest
improvement of 12.79% in terms of trade would only begin in the 2006.Q1, when the index of terms
of trade increased from 96.45 to 108.75 at the end of the period4. The export performance of Brazilian
Economy from first quarter of 2003 to last quarter of 2005 was mostly due to the level of real



3 According with trilemma of Robert Mundell it is impossible to have at the same time capital mobility, autonomous monetary policy
and managed exchange rate. Since Brazil had an open capital account and an inflation targeting regime, then a managed exchange rate
was not a policy option. In this setting making sterilized interventions in exchange rate markets could only be ineffective over the level
of nominal exchange rate (See Garcia, 2011). The first problem with this trilemma is that it does not consider the possibility of some
sort of compromise between these options. For instance, a country may decide to impose some capital controls in order to have an
autonomous monetary policy with a managed exchange rate (Bresser-Pereira, Oreiro and Marconi, 2014, p. 152). Capital account in
Brazil is better characterized by imperfect capital mobility, due to the remaining capital controls (for instance, domestic currency, the
REAL, is not convertible) and imperfect substitution between domestic and foreign bonds. Under these circumstances it is possible for
the Central Bank to control the quantity of money (or rate) and nominal exchange rate at the same time (Montiel, 2011, chapters 6-8).
4 It is noteworthy to see in figure 2 that until the 2005.Q3, real exchange rate appreciation can´t be the result of the improvement in the

terms of trade. During this period terms of trade remained practically constant, but real exchange rate appreciated almost 38%.
Exchange rate appreciation is mainly due to the strong reduction in country risk premium occurred in this period (1200 to 250 b.p.).

exchange rate, that remained under-valued at least the end of 2004 (Oreiro, Punzo and Araujo, 2012,
p. 926), and the strong growth of world economy during this period.
         Another important element for explaining macroeconomic performance is wage policy, more
precisely, the policy for minimum wage. Between January of 1999 and February of 2006, minimum
wage had an increase of 30.87% in real terms or an average real increase of 4.44% during this period.
From March of 2006 to February of 2008, however, minimum wage had a real increase of 16.82%,
i.e. a real increase of 8.4% p.y. during the entire period, almost twice of the increase observed in the
last period. This acceleration of the rate of increase in minimum wage was due to a wage rule that
President Lula negotiated with Labor Unions in 2007. According to this rule, the rate of increase in
minimum wage from one year to the other will be equal to the rate of inflation observed in the last
year plus the growth rate of real GDP observed two years before. The minimum wage policy also
helped the increase in real wages (Figure 2). The implicit objective of such a rule was to induce an
increase in the wage share, due to the fact that real wages are expected to increase at rate higher than
labor productivity. This should produce an improvement in income distribution and also boost
effective demand through the effect of increasing wage share over consumption expenditures. The
increased consumption expenditures should induce capital accumulation by private sector due to the
traditional accelerator effect. The final result should be an increase in investment rate (Figure 3) and
hence an increase of growth rate of potential output. Indeed, flexible tripod should achieve also a
higher rate of growth, stability of real exchange rate and a higher wage share (Figure 2 and 3).
        The growth performance of Brazilian economy in this period – called “growth spectacle” by
President Lula – allowed a remarkable reduction in open unemployment rate (Figure 2). Indeed,
President Lula first term had started with an unemployment rate around 13%. After reaching a peak
of 13,8%% of labor force in the 2004.1, open unemployment rate begin to fall, around 8,7% of labor
force in 2008.4. Up to Q3.2008, real exchange rate appreciation did not seem to produce any serious
harm to the performance of Brazilian manufacturing sector. The share of industrial GDP on GDP
(Figure 3) increased from 12.34% in the 2002.Q4 to 14.09% in the 2008.Q3. Compared to the
2005.Q3, industrial GDP on GDP had fallen almost 1.0%, from 15.09% to 14.09%. It is noteworthy
that this decreasing in the manufacturing share occurred almost at the same time of the reversion in
the current account from surplus to deficit and the growth acceleration in period 2006-2008 (see
Figure 5). These are clear signs that manufacturing sector was losing its dynamism due to the behavior
of real exchange rate. Facing a fall of almost 30% of industrial output and 14% in GDP occurred in
the 2008.4, Brazilian government reacted by means of a strong fiscal expansion5, followed some
months after by a considerable easing of monetary policy. At the same time, public banks (Banco do
Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal) made a considerable increase in their credit lines in order to
solve the credit crunch appeared after the collapse of international financial markets in 2008.Q4.
         The world financial crisis has a modest and temporary effect over Brazilian macroeconomic
performance. From 2008.Q4 to 2009.Q3 real GDP growth was reduced, causing an increase in
unemployment rate above 11.6% of labor force (Figure 3). The combined effects of fiscal, monetary
and credit expansion allowed Brazilian economy to recover quickly from 2008 crisis, exhibiting a
real growth rate of 9,22% of GDP in the 2010.Q4 (Figure 3). Labor market reacted also very fast to
aggregate demand stimulus, making unemployment rate to fall back at the level in the 2008.Q4. Just
after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, nominal exchange rate in Brazil had suffered a huge
depreciation due to the precautionary demand for foreign currency by domestic residents in order to
fulfill their commitments in future and derivative markets (Oreiro-Basilio, 2011). This movement of
nominal exchange rate produced a temporary reversal of the tendency for exchange rate over-
valuation observed in the period 2003-2008 (Figure 2). In the 2009.Q3, however, real exchange rate
started again to appreciate. As matter of fact, from 2009.Q3 to 2011.Q4 real exchange rate had an
appreciation of 19%, reaching its lowest level since 2003.

5 According to data of National Treasury, between 2008 and 2009, primary expenditures of federal government increased R$ 74.28
billion, an increase of 14.91% in nominal terms.
                                                                                                                            8
         In the period 2003.Q1 to 2008.Q9 the appreciation of real exchange rate in Brazil was due to
the combined effects of reduction in sovereign risk premium (up to the 2005.Q4) and improvements
in terms of trade (from the beginning of 2006 on). Now the real exchange rate appreciation appeared
to be mainly the result of improvement in terms of trade. As we can see in Figure 2, terms of trade
increased 24% between the 2009.Q3 to 2011.Q4. In order to face the real exchange rate appreciation
problem, Central Bank of Brazil continued its policy of intervention in exchange markets buying
additional quantity of international reserves (Figure 4). The international reserves increased at an
average rate of 22.01% p.y in the period 2009-2011, reaching a value of US$ 352 billion at the end
of 2011, an increase of almost 82% between 2008 and 2011. These interventions on foreign exchange
market, however, are not fully sterilized. As we can see in Table I, the stock of Repo in R$ million
and as a share of GDP had increased in 2009, but decreased strongly in 2010, showing that Central
Bank of Brazil had increased the stock of high powered money to finance the acquisition of
international reserves. These developments were possible because the world financial crisis induced
an easing of monetary policy in Brazil that resulted in a sharp decrease of nominal short-term interest
rate. The combined effects of improvement in terms of trade and reserve accumulation allowed
Brazilian economy to maintain a good average performance in the external fragility indicators
between 2008.Q4 to 2011.Q4 (external debt as a ratio of GDP, 12,36%, external debt on exports,
122.31%, reserves on external debt, 112.22%, and current account on GDP, -2.41%), clearly
indicating a situation of solvency of external accounts despite the over-valuation of real exchange
rate. International reserves were larger than external debt, indicating that Brazilian economy had also
a very comfortable liquidity position.

        The behavior of current account/GDP ratio (Figure 5) indicated a clear and growing over-
valuation or real exchange rate. In only two years, from 2008.Q4 to 2010.Q4, current account/GDP
deficit almost double, increasing from 1.81% of GDP to 3.43% of GDP. Since the increase in current
account deficit (Figure 5) was followed by a huge improvement in terms of trade (Figure 2), this
could only be the result of substitution of domestic production for imports in the manufacturing
sector. The first symptoms of Dutch Disease were beginning to appear in Brazilian economy.
        But, without questioning the conduction of economic policy, comparing 2003 with 2010, the
Lula government was able to reduce the real interest rate, the nominal interest rate, inflation and
unemployment. Brazil grew on average more than in the 90s and increased real income of the worker,
the rate of investment on GDP and achieved investment grade by agencies of sovereign risk rating.
There was a strong decline in public debt as a proportion of GDP. This exceptionally good
macroeconomic performance allowed the election of Dilma Rouseff from Labor Party (Partido dos
Trabalhadores) as President of Brazil in 2010.Q4, as successor of Lula.
             3.2 – Stagnation and Recession under Dilma Government, 2011-2015
        The substitution of domestic production for imports in Brazilian manufacturing industry
caused a stagnation of manufacturing output from the beginning of 2011 on. After a quickly recover
of the effects of world financial crisis, output of manufacturing industry remained roughly constant
at the beginning of 2011, despite Brazilian economy was still growing at a higher, although declining.
Manufacturing industry was clearly loosing dynamism due to over-valuation of real exchange rate.

Dutch disease was becoming to cause a negative structural change in Brazilian economy, reducing
the industrial GDP on GDP (Figure 3). A second wave of de-industrialization had begun (Oreiro and
Feijó, 2010). The strength of de-industrialization of Brazilian economy could be seen. From 2008.Q4
to 2011.Q4 manufacturing share in GDP had fallen from 13.92% to 11.8%, a decrease of 15.23% in
the manufacturing share in only three years. From the 2011.Q4 until the 2013.Q3, Brazilian economy
had experienced a strong growth deceleration. As we can see in Figure 6, the 12 month moving
average of real GDP growth fallen from 5.39% p.y in the 2011,Q4 to 0.84% p.y in the 2013.Q3.

        Moreover, the 12 month moving average of output in manufacturing industry had fallen 1.55%
during this period. After a quick recover of 2008 financial crisis, production of manufacturing
industry in Brazil stagnated, and this situation was slowing down GDP growth. The slowdown in
economic growth was not due to a cyclical downturn caused by a Keynesian problem of insufficiency
of aggregate demand. During this period the output gap was positive, showing that Brazilian economy
was growing above its potential or natural growth rate. The problem seemed to be a structural one:
the potential growth rate was being reduced. Another way to see that growth deceleration was not due
to a fall of aggregate demand is to compare the behavior of sales in the commercial sector with the
behavior of manufacturing industry output. As we can see in Figure 7, although manufacturing output
was declining up to the end of 2012, sales in the commercial sector were growing at a robust average
rate of 5.62% p.y in real terms.

       Thus the problem did not seem to be insufficiency of aggregate demand, but the revealed
incapacity of Brazilian industrial firms to had access to effective demand. This means that stagnation
of Brazilian economy was more likely to be the effect of real exchange rate appreciation (Figure 2)

        This process was stopped, but not reversed, under President Dilma Rouseff government. The
stagnation of manufacturing industry output combined with a strong expansion of domestic demand
resulted in the continuation of de-industrialization of Brazilian economy, measured by the industrial
GDP on GDP (Figure 3). Due to the fact that manufacturing industry is the source of increasing
returns, this structural change resulted in a reduction of potential growth rate. The de-industrialization
of Brazilian economy must not be under-estimated. From 2008.Q4 to 2014.Q4, the 12-month moving
average of industrial GDP on GDP had fallen 32.13%, from 14.75% to 10.01% 6.Facing deceleration
of GDP growth and a stagnation of industrial output since 2011, Brazilian government answered in
the same way it done in 2008, by means of a new round of easing monetary and fiscal policy, trying
to boost aggregate demand. One of the objectives of easing monetary policy was to induce a
depreciation of nominal exchange rate in order to reduce or even eliminate the over-valuation of real
exchange rate. This means that monetary policy in Brazil clearly incorporated as one of its objectives
to stabilize the real exchange rate, but without an explicit commitment with a target for nominal or
real level of exchange rate. In order to avoid a conflict between the stabilization of real exchange rate
and inflation targeting, Central Bank of Brazil choose to make an informal spreading of the
convergence period from one year to the “relevant period for monetary policy to operate”, which
means, in practice, that monetary authority has no commitment with any definite period for inflation
to converge for the center of the target (4.5% p.y), although annual inflation must be lower than the
ceiling defined by CMN (6.5% p.y). This means that in order to make possible an adjustment of real
exchange rate, Central Bank of Brazil would tolerate a higher inflation rate, between 5.0% and 5.5%
p.y, instead of 4.5% p.y. A higher real exchange rate was been traded for a higher inflation rate.
        Along with easing of monetary policy, Brazilian Central Bank tried to continue its intervention
in foreign exchange markets by means of buying international reserves (Figure 4). From 2011 to
2012, Central Bank continued to increase international reserves at a rate of almost 20% p.y as it was
done in previous years (after 2006). From 2012 on, however, the rate of reserve accumulation slowed
down and then reversed in 2014. Clearly, the policy of reserve accumulation was now reaching its
limits. From 2011 to 2012, reserve accumulation required a large increase in REPO operations as we
can see in Table I in order to avoid a decrease in short term interest rate greater than the one desired
by Brazilian Central Bank. At the end of 2013, REPO operations were near 10% of GDP, representing

cost of REPO operations were making the continuation of reserve accumulation a very costly policy
for Brazilian Government. Due to the increasing fiscal difficulties that National Treasury started to

of payments (Thirwall, 2002). For an empirical analysis of the impact of real exchange rate over income elasticities of exports and
imports see Marconi, Araujo and Oreiro (2015).

face after 2013, the intervention in foreign exchange market by means of reserve accumulation would
be stopped in 20147.
         Regarding the fiscal policy, Ministry of Finance decided that a reduction of the primary
surplus/GDP was both possible and required. The reduction of real interest rate due to easing of
monetary policy had reduced the primary surplus/GDP that was required to stabilize (net) public debt
as a ratio to GDP8. This means that fiscal space was created, allowing an easing of fiscal policy.
Besides that, growth deceleration observed after 2011 signaled a weakness of aggregate demand that
would demand some fiscal stimulus. The issue was not if a fiscal stimulus was needed, but what form
the fiscal stimulus must have. The decision of the Minister of Finance, Guido Mantega, was to use
the fiscal space to promote a semi-permanent round of tax reduction for both productive sector
(mainly automobile industry) and consumers instead of an increase in Public Investment, as it was
defended by the Vice-Minister, Nelson Barbosa. The impact of this decision over the path of primary
surplus were negative. The declared objective of the new macroeconomic regime according to the
Finance Minister Guido Mantega9 was to produce a change in the combination of interest rate and
exchange rate towards a lower nominal and real interest rate and a more competitive real exchange
rate in order to (i) boost capital accumulation and economic growth in the medium term; (ii) stimulate
manufacturing industry and revert the de-industrialization of Brazilian economy.
        Which was the result of the so-called New Macroeconomic Matrix? Growth almost stagnated,
reaching an average of only 1.73% p.y. Despite growth deceleration, output gap was positive on
average during this period, indicating that Brazilian economy was growing above potential and also
that growth potential was reduced. As a consequence, de-industrialization continued its course with
manufacturing share reaching 10.29% in the 2014.Q1 (Figure 7). The failure of new macroeconomic
matrix can be partially explained by the behavior of real exchange rate (Figure 2). The real exchange
rate depreciated but this movement was not enough to restore real exchange rate at the level observed
in the 2006.Q1, when it looked to be at a very comfortable level for both manufacturing industry and
current account. Compared to the level 2006.Q1, real exchange rate remained with an over-valuation
of 12.23% in the 2013.Q4. The surprising feature of the period was the revealed incapacity of a
remarkable low level for real short-term interest rate to stimulate economic growth.
       Thus Brazilian economy was experiencing a classical situation of profit squeeze (Table II)
which had clear and strong negative effects over the rate of capital accumulation and moderate effect
on the gross fixed capital formation on GDP (GFCF/GDP).

7 If average inflation was 5.15% in the second term of President Lula, in the period of 2011 to 2013, average inflation rose to 6.08%
p.y. After the popular protests of 2013, the political conditions in Brazil made impossible for the government to tolerate greater inflation
acceleration, making Central Bank to give up the attempt of adjusting real exchange rate to a more competitive level.

      From the first quarter of 2011 until last quarter of 2012, the moving average of the growth rate
of investment decreased, reaching minus 4.4% p.y at the end of this period. During 2013 investment
growth experienced a temporary recover may be due to the lagged effects of monetary and fiscal
policy easing, but it started again to fall in the beginning of 2014. Another important element for
explaining why exchange rate over-valuation did not cause a worsening in the external fragility
indicators was the behavior of terms of trade. In the period 2011-2013 (Figure 2) the terms of trade
remained stable at very high levels, sustaining the value of exports, despite the exchange rate over-
valuation. At the end of 2013, however, terms of trade became to deteriorate, signaling clearly the
end of commodity boom that begun in 2006. This would have a very strong and negative effect in
Brazilian economy in 2014 and 2015, helping to transform a situation of economic stagnation in a
depression of economic activity. We observe strong sharp decline in the the following variables
(Figures 3 and 4): growth rate of GDP, the investment rate, the share of investment to GDP, the share
of industrial GDP on GDP and public sector borrowing requirements on GDP. Open unemployment
rose from 6.9% to 13% in less than two years. From 2012 on, terms of trade became to deteriorate,
but remained at a higher level until the beginning of 2014. At the end of this year, terms of trade
started a new decline, returning to the level prevalent at 2006. The deterioration of the terms of trade
induced a sharp depreciation of real exchange rate (Figure 2)10. Due to the increase in the price of
tradeable goods caused by exchange rate depreciation, real income per-worker started to decline from
2014.Q3 (R$ 2422,00 to R$2209,00 in the 2015.Q3).
                4 – The effects on macroeconomic variables after shock in the Terms of Trade
       This section is dedicated to analyze the reaction functions in several macroeconomic variables
of Brazilian economy, following a positive exogenous shock in terms of trade. The period of sample
observations is 2003 to 2015, during the mandates of Presidents Lula (2003-2010) and Dilma (2011-
2015). Before the presentation of the results of the reactions functions, we adopted some statistical
and econometric procedures, usually used when working with time series 11, in order: (i) Correlation
analysis between variables (4.1 topic) and Use of Temporal Multivariate Series (4.2 topic).
              4.1 - Multiple-Variable Analysis – Correlation Matrix
        Since we are interested in the relationship between two variables, more precisely, since we
want to know how variation of one affects the other, by a shock with a commanded mechanism
transmission in a model where there variable multipath by impulse function response of a multivariate
model, we start from the bivariate correlation analysis to choose the variables to be inserted in the
VAR. To multiple times series the familiar measure of dependence is the Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficients between each of the random variables 𝑋i in the vector 𝑋 ′ = [𝑋1 𝑋2 ⋯ 𝑋𝑛 ],
𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋), is the matrix decomposition of the covariance matrix, Σ, which can be written:

       And (𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔(Σ)) 2 is the matrix triangular of the diagonal elements of Σ. The result of the
𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋) show the correlation coefficients, 𝑟𝑥𝑛𝑥𝑛 . We have adopted numerical criteria to differentiate
the degree of correlation between variables (strong, moderate or weak), according to Table III.

10 The depreciation of real exchange rate occurred from 2005.Q2 on seemed to be more the result of the political crisis that erupted in
Brazil after the beginning of President Dilma second term and the downgrade of Brazil by Rating Agencies in the 2015.Q3.

                                  Table III –Degree of correlation between variables
        Correlations were calculated on 32 samples of President Lula (2003-2010), 19 samples of
President Dilma (2011-2015) and 51 samples in the full period (2003-2015). All collected samples
are quarterly order. Also in this context, some variables had to be calculated or even handled in such
a way to adjust the database, namely the output gap, the domestic absorption, real interest rate and
the real growth rate. The usual definition of the output gap is the difference between the product
(GDP) logaritm, 𝑦𝑡 , and the product potential (potential GDP) logaritm, 𝑦𝑡∗ . We use the HP filter
(Hodrick-Prescott 1997) and were calculated as the difference between the product and its trend:
                                      𝑥𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ ∴ 𝑥𝑡 = ∁𝑡 + 𝜃𝑡 (13)
        The series 𝑥𝑡 is made up of a trend component, denoted by 𝜃 and a cyclical component,
denoted by ∁ such that in econometrics with disturb, 𝑥𝑡 = ∁𝑡 + 𝜃𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡 . For example, a positive value
for the gap product can indicate the need raise the interest rate for contain demand pressures in the
economy. The trend component that will solve minimizing the loss functions:
                              𝑇                 2       𝑇−1

                         ⏟𝑡 − 𝜃𝑡 ) + 𝜆. ∑[(𝜃𝑡+1 − 𝜃𝑡 ) − (𝜃𝑡 − 𝜃𝑡−1 ) ]2 ) (14)
             𝐿 = min (∑ (𝑥
                    𝜃
                            𝑡=1        𝑑𝑡               𝑡=2

       The first term of the equation is the sum of the squared deviations, 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑥𝑡 − 𝜃𝑡 , which
penalizes the cyclical component. The second term is a multiple λ of the sum of the squares of the
trend component's second differences. This second term penalizes variations in the growth rate of the
trend component. The larger the value of λ the higher is the penalty. Hodrick-Prescott (1997) suggest
λ =1600 as a value for quarterly data. And still T is the sample size. The variable domestic absorption,
AD, was calculated as the difference between the gross domestic product at market price, GDPmp,
and the net balance of exports of goods and services, NX:
                                              𝐴𝐷 = 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑚𝑝 − 𝑁𝑋 (15)
       We also calculate the real interest rate, r, using the following function:
                              𝑟𝑡 = 100 ∗ {((𝑖𝑡 − 𝜋𝑡 ). (1 + 𝜋𝑡 )−1 ) − 1} (16)
       Where: 𝑖𝑡 is the nominal interest rate and 𝜋𝑡 is the inflation rate. For the nominal interest rate
we use the accumulated SELIC interest in annualized month and the rate of inflation we use the Broad
Consumer Price Index (IPCA) accumulated in 12 months. The variable real growth rate of gross
domestic product accumulated in the last twelve months, %𝑃𝐼𝐵𝑟12𝑚𝑡 , was calculated by deflating
in terms of the accumulated IPCA in twelve months, 𝜋𝑡 , as follows:
                %𝑃𝐼𝐵𝑟12𝑚𝑡 = 100 ∗ {(%𝑃𝐼𝐵12𝑚𝑡 − 𝜋𝑡 ). (1 + 𝜋𝑡 )−1 ) − 1} (17)

                Table IV – Correlations between terms of trade (TT) with other macroeconomic variables
        Based on the correlations we choose the endogenous variables inserted in the terms of trade
model (TT) to dependence economy, where the shock will be given in terms of trade. The variables
are: terms of trade (TT), Country risk premium (EMBIBR), Real Exchange Rate (TRC), Real Interest
Rate (TRJ), gross fixed capital formation/GDP (GFCGGDP), Industrial GDP on GDP (GDPindGDP),
Domestic absorption(DA), Output gap (GAP), Public Sector Borrowing Requirement on GDP
(PSBRGDP), Real Labor Income(W), Unemployment(U), Inflation(IPCA). This is the starting order
of the variables into VAR, chosen after the presentation of dependent economy model (Section 2).
                     4.2 - Use of Temporal Multivariate Series
        We will use the methodology VAR to generate momentum (impulse or shocks) in terms of
trade to observe the responses in the variables. For the empirical analysis we adopted the following
in order12: (i) specify the VAR models following Sims-Stock-Watson(1990), i.e., with several
variables in level, first differences or combinations of both, (ii) choose to lag optimal VAR(p) the
criteria of Akaike (AIC), Final Prediction Error (FPE), Hannan-Quinn (HQ) and Schwarz (SC); (iii)
estimate VAR models by Estimated Generalized Least Squares (EGLS) intercept, trend, restriction
in coefficients via Top/Down method chosen by Akaike criteria; (iv) analyze the stability of VAR by
eingelvalues polynomial reverse feature; (v) make the structural break point from Chow Forecast
Test; (vi) make Cusum on each residual equation of the VAR, as Brown et al (1975); (vii) analyzing
the autocorrelation of residuals through the auto-correlation function and partial auto-correlation,
Portmanteau tests and Breusch (1978) and Godfrey (1978); (vii) analyze the normality of the residual

Hansen (1994) tests (ix) Generate impulse (shock) in the variable terms of trade and analyze the
responses of the variables entered in the systems. The basicVAR has the form:
               𝑦𝑡 = 𝐴1 . 𝑦𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝐴𝑝 . 𝑦𝑡−𝑝 + 𝐵𝑜 . 𝑥𝑡 + ⋯ + 𝐵𝑞 . 𝑥𝑡−𝑞 + 𝐶. 𝐷𝑡 + 𝜇𝑡 (18)
         Where 𝑦𝑡 = (𝑦1𝑡 , 𝑦2𝑡 , … , 𝑦𝐾𝑡 )′ is a vector of K observable endogenous variables; 𝑥𝑡 =
(𝑥1𝑡 , 𝑥2𝑡 , … , 𝑥𝑀𝑡 )′ is a vector of M observable exogenous or unmodelled variables, 𝐷𝑡 contains all
deterministic variables which may consist of a constant, a linear trend, seasonal dummy variables as
well as user specified other dummy variables, and 𝜇𝑡 is a 𝐾 dimensional unobservable zero mean
white noise process with positive definite covariance matrix 𝐸(𝑢𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡′ ) = ∑𝑢. The 𝐴𝑖 , 𝐵𝑗 and 𝐶 are
parameter matrices of suitable dimension. In the 𝑉𝐴𝑅(𝑝) process, theoretically, it is assumed that: (i)
E(𝜇𝑡 )=0; (ii) E(𝜇𝑡 𝜇𝑡′ )=∑𝑢; (iii)E(𝜇𝑡 𝜇𝑠′ )=0 for 𝑠 ≠ 𝑡; (iv) the covariance matrix, ∑𝑢 is singular. Said
properties are desirable in a 𝑉𝐴𝑅(𝑝) stable and consistent.
        The optimal lag order is chosen by minimizing one of the following information criteria for a
range of lag orders n: Akaike (AIC), Final Prediction Error (FPE), Hannan-Quinn (HQ) e Schwarz
(SC). With samples of the 2003.Q1 to 2015.Q3, the results of the SC, AIC, FPE and HQ tests,
including exogenous variables as intercept, trend and seasonal dummyes were calculated, always
searched for one to ten lag. We can see the optimal criterion for lag selection for terms of trade model
(TT model) is using the order of 3, 1 and 2 lags. The next step is to estimate the coefficients of the
specifications proposed in TT Model, according with the optimal lags obtained, in this case 1 lag, but
too 2 or 3 are used to convenience. To decrease the number of estimated parameters, we adopt the
VAR with restrictions on the coefficients, said VAR* by Estimator Generalized Least Squares
(EGLS) method and Top-Down procedure (TD), that chosen by Akaike criteria.
       After, we evaluate the stability of residues of each equation in the VAR. For strategy, began
by analyzing the Kernel probability density function on residuals. Let (𝜇1 , 𝜇2 , … , 𝜇𝑛 ) in each equation
into VAR be an independent and identically distributed sample drawn from some distribution with
an unknown density ƒ. The calculus of Kernel density estimator on residuals, 𝐾(𝜇), is:
                                                  𝑛

                       𝑓̂ℎ (𝜇) ∴ 𝐾(𝜇) = 𝑛ℎ . ∑{𝐾(∗). [(𝜇 − 𝜇𝑖 ). ℎ−1 ]} (19)

                                                 𝑖=1

       Where the h is called the scaled Kernel, 𝐾(∗) is a function tha define a kernel distribution:
                                                       −1          −1 .𝜇 2 )
                                     𝐾 ∗ = (√2. 𝜋) . 𝑒𝑥𝑝−(2                    (20)
      𝐾 is a non-negative function that integrates to one and has mean zero, and ℎ > 0 is a smoothing
parameter called the bandwidth. To illustrate the residual analysis (Figure 9), we take a simulated
random sample from the standard normal distribution in the Kernel density, with h=0.05 at h=2.

         We observed that the estimated residuals of the VAR equations have similarities with the
normal distribution (zero skewness and tree kurtosis). Some residues exhibit leptokurtic curves and
others exhibit mesokurtics curves. Yet all residues exhibit some form of symmetry about zero. The
next step is to perform multivariate normality test JB, Jarque-Bera (1987), Lütkepohl (1991) and
Doornik-Hansen (1994). The JB test is based on the third and fourth central moments of the standard
normal distribution (skewness and kurtosis). The Lütkepohl tests and Doornik-Hansen show small
systematic deviations of skewness and kurtosis observed by viewing the Gaussian kernel in some
residual, but do not reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normality of the residuals of the terms
of trade model. As for the JB test, the results do not reject the null hypothesis of normality residual.
One of the most important tests in the VAR model, when it incorporates stationary variables and non-
stationary, mixed way comments the article Sims Stock-Watson (1990), is to see if the set of equations
of VAR has stability and consistent. The joint distribution of equations into VAR process is uniquely
determined by the distributions 𝜇𝑡 process. The first and second time of VAR process, ie, the mean
and covariance, are independent of time, therefore stationary and stable. The VAR process is stable
if the reverse characteristic polynomial has no roots inside the unit circle and the circle unit complex.
Formally, this condition is given by:
            𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼𝐾𝑝 − 𝐴. 𝑧) ≠ 0 ∴ 𝑑𝑒𝑡(𝐼𝐾 − 𝐴1 . 𝑧 − 𝐴2 . 𝑧 2 − ⋯ − 𝐴𝑝 . 𝑧 𝑝 ) ≠ 0 (20)
        Where 𝐼𝐾 is the identity matrix, A is the set of matrix coefficients and z is modulus of the
eigenvalues of the reverse characteristic polynomial. We can filter VAR models eliminating those
that have at least one value in module of eigenvalues of polynomial lower reverse feature that unit.
The Table V shows the results of modulus of the eigenvalues of the reverse characteristic polynomial,
z, being stable VAR and the covariance matrix, ∑𝑢, is not singular.

        Finally, to check if VAR processes is stable we need to check the residual autocorrelation, as
in theory E(𝜇𝑡 𝜇𝑠′ )=0 for 𝑠 ≠ 𝑡. In practice it is almost inevitable when there are several variables in
the VAR system. However the use of optimum lag assists order to improve the problem of residual
autocorrelation. Tests such as Portmanteau and Lagrange Multiplier Breusch-Godfrey Test13, help to
determine whether, in general, there is residual autocorrelation in the VAR models. The Portmanteau
test and Lagrange Multipliers Test Breusch-Godfrey has the null hypothesis not residual
                             ′
autocorrelation, 𝐻0 =E𝜇𝑡 𝜇𝑡−𝑖   =0, with 𝑠 = 𝑡 − 𝑖 and 𝑖 = 1,2, … , ℎ.The alternative hypothesis test is
that at least one auto-covariance, and thus a self-correlation is not zero, showing auto-correlation.
Using the Chi-Square distribution in both tests, with 5 % significance, both the Portmanteau test and
Breusch- Godfrey test does not reject the null hypothesis of no residual autocorrelation.
       In this sense residual CUSUM tests and parameters constancy Chow tests were used to verify
the parameter constancy. To test this, the Figure 10 presents the Chow test results14 for structural
break in the last years of multivariate temporal series into VAR model. The dotted line show the p-
values with 5% and 10% of significance. The null hypothesis of constant parameters, including the
residual covariance matrix,∑𝑢, is rejected between 2012 and 2013 and strongly in 2015, government
mandate of Dilma (see the section 2 to details of this moment). Replicating CUSUM stability test on
residuals proposed by Brown et al (1975) in the terms of trade model, over the past years (2009-
2015), the results observed indicate stability on VAR process, with 5% significance.

        The total cumulative effects of impulses in the residuals, 𝑢𝑡 ’s, were obtained by addition of
appropriate coefficients of Impulse Response Function (IRF). The responses, which generate a shock
in terms of trade, can be observed in the Figure 11. As we can see a positive shock in Terms of Trade
is associated with a permanent decrease in the sovereign risk premium measures by EMBI+, in the
investment rate, industrial GDP on GDP, unemployment rate and inflation. Real exchange rate
appreciates in first instance, and then depreciates.

              Figure 11: Accumulated Responses in the variables after Impulse in the terms of trade (TT)
        The change from a good to a poor macroeconomic performance in Brazil after 2013 can be
partially explained by the combined effects of a negative shock in terms of trade and a positive shock
in domestic absorption due to the trend increase in primary expenditures to GDP. But these factors
do not seem to be enough to explain the magnitude of the fall in GDP occurred in 2015. As we saw
in figure 10 there is econometric evidence of structural break in the econometric model in 2012, 2013
and, more strongly, in 2015. This structural break may be caused by the increased in the perception
of uncertainty due to the recent Brazilian political crisis and the empirical evidence on Brazilian case
about terms of trade and real exchange rate over-valuation.
5 – Final Remarks
         What factors explain this collapse of Brazilian macroeconomic performance after 2014? We
had that due to exchange rate over-valuation caused by the improvement in Terms of Trade, Brazilian
economy had experienced some structural negative changes like de-industrialization and re-
primarization of exports that reduced its long-run growth potential. These structural changes were
sufficient to explain a situation of near stagnation that Brazil experienced in the period 2011-2013;
but are incapable for its own to produce a deep recession as the one seen in 2015. A recession is
always and elsewhere caused by insufficient effective demand, so in order to explain why Brazil
entered in a deep recession we have to understand what factors caused a fall of aggregate demand at
the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. The first cause of the contraction of aggregate demand was
the reduction of investment rate. As we can see in figure 3 below, investment had fallen from 20.92%
of GDP in the first quarter of 2014 to 18.12% of GDP in the third quarter of 2015, a fall of 2.80% of
GDP in less than two years. This contraction of investment demand is for sure the result of ROE
falling below the safe rate of interest after 2012 as we had seen in last section, i.e. a result of a profit
squeeze. Besides that, the public scandal originated by police investigations of corruption (the so-
called “operação lava-jato”) at PETROBRAS had provoked a major political crisis with a serious
threat of impeachment of President Dilma Rouseff. This crisis had also a clear and negative (but until
now not quantified) effect over investment expenditures of private sector since it increased the
perceived uncertainty in economic environment. Finally, the deterioration in terms of trade had also
a negative effect over profitability of investment projects of the mining industry (oil and iron ore),
which become increasing important in Brazil during the commodity boom. The second cause was the
huge contraction of real income per-worker since the beginning of 2015. As we can see in figure 2,
in the first semester of 2015 real income per-worker started to fall at a very fast rate, with the expected
effects over consumption expenditures. The fall in real income per-worker was the result of inflation
acceleration occurred in 2015 combined with the increasing in the rate of unemployment (Figure 3).
To sum-up, a combination of change in international economic environment, delayed effects of errors
                                                                                                           19
in the conduction of economic policy, profit squeeze and a major political crisis had created the
scenario of a perfect storm, generating a huge contraction of aggregate demand that reduced growth
below potential. Since potential growth was reduced due to negative structural changes that Brazilian
economy faced as a consequence of exchange rate over-valuation, the result was a deep recession,
probably the deepest that occurred in Brazil since the end of Second World War. The positive side of
this scenario is that real exchange rate seemed to return to a competitive level in the second semester
of 2015. Indeed, nominal exchange rate had experienced a huge depreciation due to the combined
effects of deterioration of terms of trade and uncertainty created by the political crisis in Brazil. From
July of 2014 to July of 2015, nominal exchange rate had devaluated in 49,7%, reaching a value near
R$ 3,40 in the beginning of august. If we consider the industrial equilibrium exchange rate (Bresser-
Pereira, Oreiro and Marconi (2014) and Marconi, 2012)) as the adequate measure for a competitive
exchange rate. This means that exchange rate adjustment is done, which can give a start in a possible
re-industrialization of Brazilian economy.
