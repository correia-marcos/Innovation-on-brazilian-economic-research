         Evolutionary theories of economic change identify the processes of idiosyncratic learning by
      individual firms and of market selection as the two main drivers of the dynamics of industries.
      Are such processes able to account for the statistical regularities which industrial structures and
      dynamics display? In this work we address this question by means of a simple multi-firm model
      formalizing the mechanisms of learning and selection. As such, despite its simplicity, the model is
      able to robustly reproduce an ensemble of empirical stylised facts, including ample heterogeneity in
      productivity distributions, persistent market turbulence and fat-tailed distribution of growth rates.

1    Introduction
Evolutionary theories of economic change identify the processes of idiosyncratic learning by individual
firms and of market selection as the two main drivers of the dynamics of industries. The interplay
between these two engines shapes the dynamics of entry-exit and market shares and, collectively, the
productivities and size distributions, and the patterns of growth of both variables. Learning (what
in the empirical literature is sometimes broadly called the within effect) stands for various processes
of idiosyncratic innovation, imitation, and changes in techniques of production. Selection (what is
usually denominated the between effect) is the outcome of processes of market interaction where more
competitive firms gain market share at the expense of less competitive ones, some firms die, and
others enter. The ensuing industrial dynamics presents some remarkable and quite robust statistical
properties – “stylized facts” – which tend to hold across industries and countries, levels of aggregation
and time periods (for a critical surveys, see Dosi, 2007, Doms and Bartelsman, 2000, and Syverson,
2011).
    In particular, such stylized facts include:

    • persistent heterogeneity in productivity and all other performance variables;

    • persistent market turbulence, due to change in market shares and entry-exit processes;

    • skewed size distributions;

    • fat-tailed distribution of growth rates;

    • scaling of the growth-variance relationship.

Different theoretical perspectives address the interpretation of one or more of such empirical regu-
larities. One stream of analysis, which could go under the heading of equilibrium evolution, tries to
interpret size dynamics in term of passive (Jovanovic (1982)) or active learning (Ericson and Pakes
(1995)) by technically heterogeneous but “rational” firms. Another stream – from the pioneering
work by Ijiri and H. Simon (1977) all the way to Bottazzi and Secchi (2006a) – studies the joint out-
come of both learning and selection mechanisms in terms of the ensuing exploitation of new business
opportunities.
A third stream, including several contributions by Metcalfe (see among others Metcalfe (1998)), fo-
cuses on the competition/selection side often represented by means of replicator dynamics whereby
market shares vary as a function of the relative competitiveness or “fitness” of the different firms.
Finally, many evolutionary models try to unpack the two drivers of evolution distinguishing between
some idiosyncratic processes of change in the techniques of production, on the one hand, and the
dynamics of differential growth driven either by differential profitabilities and the ensuing rates of
investment (such as in R. R. Nelson and Winter (1982)), or by an explicit replicator dynamics, (such
in Silverberg et al. (1988) and in Dosi, Marsili, et al. (1995)), on the other.
In the following contribution we shall present a simple multi-firm model, formalizing the mechanisms
of learning and selection. It is well placed in the evolutionary tradition but, to our knowledge, well
beyond incumbent models, is able to robustly reproduce the foregoing ensemble of empirical stylised
facts, including ample heterogeneity in productivity distributions, persistent market turbulence and
fat-tailed distribution of growth rates.
One of the basic intuition in our whole interpretation is that both learning and competition processes
entail correlation mechanisms which yield as such systematic departures from Gaussian stochastic
processes. It is an intuition already explored by Bottazzi and Secchi (2006a) with respect to the ex-
ploitation of “business opportunities”, which we shall expand also in relation to competition processes.
This is what Bottazzi (2014) calls the bosonic nature of firm growth, in analogy with the correlating
property of elementary particles – indeed the bosons.
Systematic correlations induce non-fading (possibly amplifying) effects of intrinsic differences, or even
different degrees of “luck”, across firms, both “intra-period” (however a “period” is defined) and over
time.
Bottazzi and Secchi (2006a) show how such correlations generically underlie fat-tailed distributions

of firm growth rates. We push the analysis further, showing that competition-driven replicators yield
similar fat-tailedness properties. Moreover, by unpacking the learning and selection parts of the pro-
cess, we attempt to distinguish what is generic across all processes and what is specific to particular
learning-competition regimes. Finally, our model of industrial dynamics characterised by cumulative
learning and competitive selection, or even just the latter (cum entry) is able to account for a few other
salient empirical features of industrial change. Section 2 briefly summarizes the empirical regularities
and Section 3 discusses the main theoretical models aimed at explaining some of them. Section 4
presents the model and Section 5 analyses the results.


2        Empirical stylised facts: productivity, size and growth
During the last few decades, enabled by the availability of longitudinal micro data, an increasing
number of studies have identified a rich ensemble of “stylised facts” related to productivities, firm sizes
and firm growth rate distributions. Let us consider some of them, germane to the results of the model
which follows.

Productivity distribution and growth
As extensively discussed in Doms and Bartelsman (2000), Syverson (2011), Dosi (2007) and Foster
et al. (2008), among many others, productivity dispersion, at all levels of disaggregation, is a striking
and very robust phenomenon. Moreover, such heterogeneity across firms is persistent over time, (cf.
Bartelsman and Dhrymes (1998), Dosi and Grazzi (2006) and Bottazzi, Secchi, and Tamagni (2008)),
with autocorrelation coefficients in the range 0.8 − 1. An illustration is provided in Figure 1 for one
2-digit Italian sector and two 3-digit thereof. The distribution and its support are quite stable over
time and so is the “pecking order” across firms, as suggested by the high autocorrelation coefficients:
see Figure 2. These findings, which hold under parametric and non-parametric analyses, empirically
discard any idea of firms’ revealed production process as the outcome of an exercise of optimization over
a commonly shared production possibility set – which, under common relative prices, ought to yield
quite similar input/output combinations. Rather asymmetries are impressive (notice the wide support
of the distribution that goes from 1 to 5 in log terms), which tells of a history of both firm-specific
learning patterns and of co-existence in the market of low and high productivity firms, with no trace
of convergence (see Dosi, Grazzi, Tomasi, et al. (2012)). Even more so, asymmetries are pronounced
in emerging economies (with only some reduction along the process of development): see on China, Yu
et al. (2015). In that, the survival of dramatically less efficient firms hint at a structurally imperfect
mechanism of market selection, which demand a theoretical interpretation. All this evidence relates
to asymmetries in labour productivities but also to firm-level TFPs, notwithstanding the shakiness of
the latter notion (more in Dosi, Grazzi, Marengo, et al. (2013), and Yu et al. (2015)).
A less explored phenomenon related to the dynamic of productivity is the double exponential nature
of its growth rate distributions. Extensive evidence is provided in Bottazzi, Grazzi, et al. (2005)
and Dosi, Grazzi, Tomasi, et al. (2012): see Figure 3 for an illustration. The double exponential
nature of growth rate in productivity does not only reveals an underlining multiplicative process that
determines efficiency changes, but also suggests processes of idiosyncratic learning characterized by
discrete, relatively frequent “big” events.

Size distribution
Firm size distributions are skewed. And this is an extremely robust property which, again, holds
across sectors, countries and levels of aggregation. But, how skewed is “skewed”?
The power-law nature (Pareto or Zipf law, according to the slope of the straight line, in a log-log plot)1
of the firm size distribution, has been investigated by many authors2 since the pioneering work by H. A.
Simon and Bonini (1958). This is not the place to discuss the possible generating mechanism of such
distribution (an insightful discussion is in Brock (1999)). Here, just notice that on empirical grounds,

size distributions across manufacturing sub-sectors differ a lot in terms of shape, fatness of the tails
and even modality (Bottazzi, Cefis, Dosi, and Secchi (2007) and Dosi, Gambardella, et al. (2008)).
Plausibly, technological factors, the different degree of cumulativeness in the process of innovation,
the predominance of process vs. product innovation, and the features of market competition might
strongly affect (fined defined) sector-specific size distributions (Marsili, 2005). Indeed, it might well
be that the findings on the Zipf (Pareto) law distributions are a mere effect of aggregation as already
conjectured in Dosi, Marsili, et al. (1995). Hence, what should be retained here is the skewness of
the distribution rather than their precise shapes (see Figure 4 for a quite frequent shape of the upper
tail).

Market turbulence
Underneath the foregoing invariances, however, there is a remarkable turbulence involving changes
in market shares, entry and exit (cf. the discussion in Baldwin and Rafiquzzaman (1995) and Doms
and Bartelsman (2000)). A good deal of such turbulence is due to “churning” of going firms, with
20% − 40% of entrants die in the first two years and only 40% − 50% survive beyond the seventh year
in a given cohort.

An index that synthesizes the market turbulence is shown in Table 1 presenting some synthetic statis-
tics on Italian micro data, both in terms of sales and value added market shares. The I index reads
as the sum of the absolute value of market share variations

Fat-tailed distributions of growth rates
A huge empirical literature testifies the emergence of the Laplace distribution in growth rates. A
typical empirical finding is illustrated in 5. This applies across different levels of sectoral disaggrega-

tion, across countries, over different historical periods for which there are available data. This stylised
fact is robust to different measures of growth, e.g., in terms of sales, value added or employment (for
more details see Bottazzi, Cefis, and Dosi (2002), Bottazzi and Secchi (2006a), Bottazzi, Secchi, and
Tamagni (2008) and Dosi (2007)).
Firms grow and decline by relatively lumpy jumps which cannot be accounted by the cumulation of
small, “atom-less”, independent shocks. Rather “big” episodes of expansion and contraction are rela-
tively frequent. More technically, this is revealed by fat-tailed distributions (in log terms) of growth
rates. What determines such property?
In general, such fat-tailed distributions are powerful evidence of some underlying correlation mech-
anism. Intuitively, new plants arrive or disappear in their entirety, and, somewhat similarly, novel
technological and competitive opportunities tend to arrive in “packages” of different “sizes” (i.e., eco-
nomic importance).

Growth-size scaling relationships
The multiplicative process of firm growth is (roughly) uncorrelated with size, at least for not too small
firms. This is what goes under the heading of the Gibrat law.
However, the variance of growth rates falls with size. How the level and growth rate of size are related
to each other? Since Stanley, Amaral, et al. (1996), an extensive literature of empirical articles found
a negative correlation between the variance of growth rates and size (see Sutton (2002), Lee et al.
(1998)). An illustration of the phenomenon is provided in Figure 6. The underlying idea is that firms
can be described as a collection of independent units, each of them characterised by an independent
growth process. The bigger the firm, the higher the number of its components (“lines of business”).
Hence, under an assumption of (quasi) independent growth processes for each unit, the variance of the
growth rate decreases proportionally to the inverse square root of size. Bottazzi and Secchi (2006b)
convincingly argue that the cause of this negative correlation is product differentiation: bigger firms
tend to operate in more sub-markets which are hardly likely to be perfectly correlated. As a direct
consequence, the variance of the growth rate ought to fall as the size of firms increases.

To summarize, the challenge for the theory is to account for: [i] persistent heterogeneity in produc-
tivities, [ii] skewness in size distributions, [iii] market turbulence, [iv] fat-tailed distribution of growth
rates, [v] negative variance-size correlations.
How do incumbent theories fare in this respect?

3    The model
The model is an evolutionary model microfounded upon simple behavioural rules and heuristics. The
absence of any rational expectations (technological or otherwise) is intentionally pursued. Most of
individual (and more so organizational) decisions and behaviours take place under conditions of envi-
ronmental complexity, radical uncertainty and massively imperfect information. The microeconomics
of our model fully acknowledges all that and is inscribed within the perspective of “bounded rational-
ity”, written large (within a vast literature, see the classic March and H. Simon (1958), R. R. Nelson
and Winter (1982), and Gigerenzer and Selten (2002)).
The three processes that take place in the simulated industry are learning, selection and entry-exit.

Idiosyncratic learning processes
We build upon a simplified version of Dosi, Marsili, et al. (1995) whereby learning is represented
by some multiplicative stochastic process upon firms productivities – or more generically “levels of
competitiveness” – ai of the form

                                      ai (t) = ai (t − 1)(1 + θi (t))                                (2)
                                                                        N (t)
where the θi (t) are realizations of a sequence of random variables {Θi }i=1 , and N (t) is the number of
firms. Such dynamics is meant to capture the idiosyncratic accumulation of capabilities within each
firm (see Teece et al. (1994) and Dosi, R. Nelson, et al. (2000)). This entails various types of process
innovation – yielding higher production efficiency and plausibly lower output prices – and new and
improved products. This latter dynamics is not explicitly formalized in our utterly simple model but
one may think of new products as higher value added ones, thus implicitly proxied by higher value of
ai .
The process is a multiplicative random walk with drift: the multiplicative nature is well in tune with
the evidence on productivity dynamics under the further assumption that if a firm draws a negative
θi , it will stick to its previous technique (negative shocks in normal times are quite unreasonable!).
We experiment with different learning processes, whereby θi (t) is drawn from a set of possible alter-
native distributions, namely Normal, Lognormal, Poisson, Laplace and Beta. Eq. (2) models learning
in our Baseline Regime. Further, we experiment, as one already did in Dosi, Marsili, et al. (1995),
with two other more extreme regimes, named Schumpeter Mark I and Schumpeter Mark II, somewhat
dramatizing the role attributed to entrants vs. incumbents by the “young Schumpeter” (Schumpeter,
1912) and the “old Schumpeter” (Schumpeter, 1947).
      Under Schumpeter Mark I
                                                  θi (t) = 0                                          (3)

                                θi (t) = πi (t) P                                                                   (4)
                                                 i ai (t − 1)si (t − 1)

where πi (t) is the same draw process as under the Baseline Regime. At one extreme, in the first case,
incumbents do not learn after birth. Advances are only carried by new entrants. At the opposite
extreme, in the latter case, incumbents do not only learn, but do it in a cumulative way so that a draw
by any firm is scaled by its extant relative competitiveness. This captures what Paul David, quoting
Robert Merton, called the “Matthew effect”.3

Market selection and birth-death processes
Competitive interactions are captured by a “quasi replicator dynamics”
                                                                      
                                                              ai (t)

where                                                   X
                                              ā(t) =       ai (t)si (t − 1)                                        (6)
                                                        i

where si (t) is the market share of firm i which changes as a function of the ratio of the firm’s produc-
tivity (or “competitiveness”) to the weighted average of the industry. It is a “quasi-replicator” since
a genuine replicator lives on the unit simplex. The “quasi” one may well yield negative shares, under
certain parametrizations, in which case the firm is declared dead and market shares are accordingly
recomputed. A is an elasticity parameter that captures the intensity of the selection exerted by the
market, in terms of market share dynamics and, indirectly, of mortality of low competitiveness firms.
Below, we shall study the effect of different degrees of market selectiveness upon industry structures
and dynamics.
Finally, we assume that entry of new firms occurs proportionally to the number of incumbents present
in the market
                                           E(t) = ω(t)N (t − 1)                                       (7)
where E(t) is the number of entrants at time t, N (t − 1) is the number of incumbents in the previous
period and ω(t) is a random variable uniformly distributed on a finite support (which in the following,
for simplicity,we assume drawn from a uniform distribution). The idea that the number of entrants
is proportional to the number of incumbents is strongly corroborated empirically: see e.g., P. Geroski
(1991) and P.A. Geroski (1995). However, the evidence supports also a rough proportionality between
entry and exit: thus, in the simplest version of the model, we assume a constant number of firms with
the number of dying firms offset by a equal number of entrants.
The productivity of entrants follows a process similar to Eq. (2) but applied to the average productivity
of the industry, whose stochastic component θj (t) is again a random extraction from alternative

   Of course, here θj (t) can get negative values. Indeed, the location of the mass of the distribution –
over negative or positive shocks – captures barriers to learning by the entrant or, conversely, the
“advantage of newness”.

Timeline of events
    • There are N initial incumbent firms. At time 0 they have equal productivities and equal market
      shares.

    • At the beginning of each period, except under Mark I Regime, firms learn according to the
      process specific to each regime.

    • Firms acquire or lose market share, according to the replicator.

    • Firms exit the market according to the rule: si (t) < smin .

    • The number, the competitiveness and the size of entrants are determined and market shares of

4    Model properties and simulation results
Let us consider the model properties together with the simulation results which we shall present
according to the empirical “stylised facts” the model is able to replicate. The model is parametrized
according to Table 2 and the benchmark distribution for the extraction of the micro-shocks is a Beta
distribution if not otherwise specified.

Productivity distribution
The productivity distributions obtained from the three regimes are presented in Figure 7.
The normalized productivity distributions are calculated as
                                                         X
                               ci (t) = log ai (t) − log   ai (t)si (t − 1)                          (9)
                                                        i

As already mentioned, ci (t) turns out in the real world to be rather disperse over a wide support
with a persistency of such asymmetries over time. It is interesting to notice how the support of the
distribution (in logs) spans between (−1, 0.5) in the Baseline Regime, shrinks in the Mark I Regime
(−0.5, 0.2), and expands in the Schumpeter Mark II (−1.4, 0.8). If innovation is endogenous the
support is wider and even more so if it is cumulative as under the Schumpeter Mark II regime.
The autocorrelation structure of productivities is reported in Table 3: the coefficients are well in tune
with the empirical evidence.

Market turbulence and concentration
The dynamic of entry and exit in all scenarios drives an everlasting churning dynamics. Table 4
presents an ensemble of descriptive statistics about the number of entrants, the average age, the average
productivity growth, the average size growth, the entry-exit dynamics, and the market concentration.
Interestingly, and somewhat counterintuitively, firms’ life expectation is the highest under the no-
incumbent learning (Schumpeter Mark I) regime (21 periods) and the lowest in the cumulative regime
(4 periods). This is a robust sign of the effects of “creative destruction” when innovation is endogenous,
even (indeed, especially) when learning is highly cumulative, with a galaxy of fringe firms entering and
quickly dying around a “core” of successful incumbents. The three regimes show increasing degrees of
turbulence, from Mark I to Mark II (see Figure 8). The reported average values are strikingly close
to the empirical data shown in Table 1.
Finally, the market concentration, measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index4 in typical simulation
runs, is illustrated in Figure 9. The Mark I Regime concentration is relatively low and stable over time;
conversely, in the Baseline and in the Mark II regimes, phases of high and low concentration alternate,
signalling the presence of endogenous cycles which are not related to “market power” but, rather, to
the path-dependent dynamics of innovative successes and ensuing differential competitiveness.

Size distribution

one. However, beyond some cut-off point sizes appear to be rather skewed across all the three regimes
(compared with the Lognormal fit which we added as a benchmark). In case of the Schumpeter Mark
I, the cut-off point is higher than in the other two cases: a bigger fraction of firms belong to the upper
tail in the Baseline and the Mark II regimes. Again, these results seem in line with the empirical
evidence discussed in Section 2.2.

where market shares are our proxy for size. Figure 11 shows the growth rate distributions across the
three regimes. Notice the strong fat-tailed departure from any Normal distribution in all the three
regimes.
In order to test for the robustness of these results, we experimented with four alternative distributions
for the innovation shocks, namely Laplace, Lognormal, Normal, and Poisson. Figure 12 shows the
results for the four distributions across the three regimes. The departure from (log)normality and the
emergence of fat tails is rather striking, independently from the shape of the micro-shocks.
To understand how “fat” the tails are, we estimated the parameters of a symmetric Subbotin distribu-
tion, defined by the parameters m, a and b, wherein m is a location measure, a is the scale parameter
capturing the central part of the distribution and b the fatness of the tails. The Subbotin distribution

    according to the value of the parameter b, can yield [i] a Normal distribution, if b = 2, or [ii] a
Laplace distribution, if b = 1. Estimates of the Subbotin distribution parameters are presented in
Table 5. Across the three regimes, the value of the b parameter is always significantly smaller than 2
(the Normal case).
What is the source of the tent-shaped distribution of growth rates? Start by noting that the competitive
process as such induces ex post correlation in growth rates: the growth of the share of any one firm
induces the fall of the total share of its competitors. Indeed, replicator dynamics yields a mechanism
of correlation equivalent to a Polya urn mechanism.
As demonstrated by Schreiber (2001) and discussed in Pemantle (2007), the stochastic replicator is
a generalized Polya urn scheme. According to the latter, suppose that, at each time t ≥ 0, there
is a population of firms N (t) whose only attribute is the relative “fitness” (or “competitiveness” or
productivity as in our case) mi (t) = ai (t)/ā(t), i ∈ {1, ..., N }. These firms can be represented in an
urn with balls of colors m, being mi (t) the relative “fitness” of firm i and the market share si (t) its
outcome. At each time step t two balls (firms) are randomly extracted and get their mi,j compared.
The firm with the higher fitness reintroduces its ball and adds another one of the same color. Along the
process, being mi (t) a measure of the fitness of firm i in the population, its representation si (t) (market
share) changes proportionally to its fitness against the others N (t) − 1 firms/balls: the growth of firm
i is proportional to its own success against all the other firms, weighted by their own representation
in the population. That is, in our formulation

As Schreiber (2001) and Pemantle (2007) show, local, pairwise interactions yield asymptotically to the
replicator properties of the system. Indeed, the competitive dynamics induces long-range correlations
across the whole population also under finite total number of new balls (“opportunities”) per period,
here as well as in Bottazzi and Secchi (2006a). A tricky issue, in all Polya-type models, is the
relationships between the periods over which we measure variables, say years, and the frequency of
arrival of “opportunities events”. This is beyond the scope of this work. Let us just notice that
sufficient to our argument is the monotonicity in the two dynamics.
The basic intuition, our simulations show, holds generically across alternative shapes of micro-shocks
and robustly reproduces the fat-tailed distribution of growth rates under the three learning processes.
Remarkably, in the Schumpeter Mark II case, a strict Laplace distribution emerges.

Table 6: Estimation of the slope coefficient of linear scaling variance-growth correlation across regimes.


The slope coefficient β is presented in Table 6 (here the independent variable are market shares rather
than sheer size, but the two, in finite markets, easily map). Across the three regimes, the negative
linear correlation is always present. It is important to notice that our scaling is linear in size and
not log-linear like in empirical data. However in our simple model we do not have diversification and
multi-product firms. And, expectedly, we do not find any power law type scaling of the growth variance-
size relationship. But, what is the source of any persistent negative relationship even if of a linear
nature? A possible theoretical origin of variance scaling, as already mentioned, has been extensively
discussed in Bottazzi and Secchi (2006b), and we believe that is the first order interpretation. In our
model there is no possibility of a process of differentiation, but nonetheless the negative scaling holds.
Why? Recalling Eq. (5), it is straightforward how the size growth rate depends on the firm relative
productivity mi = ai /ā. The higher the size (share) of firm i, other things being equal, the nearer
the firm is to the market weighted average, since it disproportionally contributes the average itself. It
is as if size as such “bends” the selection landscape. In order to visualize this, think of the extreme
of a monopolist: in this case, its own competitiveness is also the market average and, of course, the
replicator dynamics impact upon growth variance is nil. At the opposite extreme, smaller firms might
be by far more or less competitive than the mean but, because of their size, they have a negligible
effect upon the “selection” process. Hence, their growth rates are more prone to fluctuate. This
induce the emergence of a core-periphery structure where bigger firms tend to have a lower variation
in their growth rate while the smaller ones fuel the turbulence of market shares. Needless to say, this
interpretation of the variance scaling relation does not contradict the diversification hypothesis. It
just adds to it a scale dependence of the very yardstick of competitive selection.

Cumulativeness and selection
We have argued above that the very competition process robustly induces fat-tailed distributed growth
rates, even in absence of learning. But of course, cumulative learning is also plausibly enhancing such
fat-tailedness, and so does the increase in the “fierceness” of competition. Let us explore this conjecture

in the case of the Schumpeter Mark II regime. To do this, we study the effects on the distribution
of firms growth rate of the γ parameter, which captures the degree of cumulativeness in the learning
process, and the A parameter, which embodies the selectivity of the market mechanism.
We start by analysing the effect of cumulativeness. As expected, the increase in the γ parameter, as
shown in Figure 14, induces a more tent-shaped distribution of the growth rates, up to the point of
becoming “super Laplacian”, with the estimate of b – the tail estimate of the distribution – falling
below one. Notice that the estimates under such regime are those which look closer to the empirical
ones, circumstantial evidence that Matthews effects are quite widespread. It is worth underlining that
the causality here goes from the cumulative learning process to the selection mechanism and, then, to
the dynamics of firm growth, in absence of any contemporaneous correlation among the productivity
shocks themselves.
Regarding the effect of parameter A, Figure 15 illustrates the asymmetric effects of different degrees of
market selectiveness. On the one side, A influences the support of the tail of surviving, negative-growth
firms and, on the other, the growth of successful ones, that is, the conditions of the coexistence of
both high growth firms, the “gazzellas” at the upper-right tail, and the “laggards” at the lower-left tail.
This hints that the selection parameter is positively correlated to the asymmetry of the distribution.


5    Conclusions
There is an ensemble of “stylised facts” on industrial dynamics which ubiquitously emerges across
industries, levels of aggregation, times and countries. They include: wide and persistent asymmetries
in degrees of relative efficiency, however measured; skewed size distributions; persistent turbulence in

market dynamics; negative scaling relations between firm sizes and variance in firm growth rates; and,
last but not least, fat-tailed distributions of growth rates themselves.
We show that all these regularities can be accounted for by a very simple evolutionary model whereby
the dynamics is driven by some learning process by incumbents and entrants (or at least by entrants
alone) together with some process of competitive selection. They correlate the growth (and survival)
fates across firms, even in absence of correlations in the original “technological shocks” themselves. We
also show that this interpretation is robust to different learning and competition regimes, including
the extreme archetypes wherein incumbents do not learn at all or, other, with incumbents building
success upon success.
