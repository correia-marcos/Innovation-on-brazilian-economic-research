RESUMO
Atualmente, há muita discussão sobre os desafios de combinar questões econômicas e
ambientais. O governo brasileiro tem investido na expansão das áreas irrigadas, especialmente no
Nordeste do Brasil. O Projeto de Transferência de Água do São Francisco, que envolve recursos
da ordem de R $ 8,2 bilhões, procura expandir a infra-estrutura de água para abastecer a Bacia
Sub-Médio do Rio São Francisco. A água para os novos projetos de irrigação no Nordeste virá
diretamente do rio São Francisco ou dos canais em construção. Há estimativas de que, em cerca
de três décadas, a área sob irrigação fornecida pela bacia Sub-Médio poderia aumentar em mais
de 10 vezes sua média atual. Juntos, as mudanças climáticas e a expansão das áreas irrigadas no
Nordeste podem aumentar os conflitos entre outros usos da água. Neste contexto, devem ser
estabelecidas políticas públicas para promover esquemas de alocação de água inter e intra-
setoriais mais eficientes. Este estudo usou uma matriz regional de insumo-produto ano 2010
adaptada para a região hidrográfica do Sub-Médio São Francisco (IO-SMSF), para simular
impactos econômicos que acompanham mudanças na disponibilidade de água pelo setor
econômico na sub-bacia de acordo com decisões de alocação de água. Os resultados indicaram
até que ponto a restrição de água impacta a produção de atividades altamente dependentes, como
a agricultura e o emprego local. Os resultados obtidos fornecem uma medida para os custos de
oportunidade de usar a água para fins diferentes das necessidades locais. Palavras Chave:

ABSTRACT
Currently there is much discussion about the challenges of combining economic and
environmental issues. The Brazilian government has been investing the expansion of irrigated
areas, especially in the Northeast of Brazil. The São Francisco Water Transfer Project, involving
resources on the order of R$ 8.2 billion, seeks to expand the water infrastructure to deliver water
from the Sub-Middle São Francisco River Basin. The water for a significant part of the new
irrigation projects in Northeast will either come directly from the São Francisco River or from
the channels being constructed. There are estimates that in about three decades, the area under
irrigation supplied by the Sub-Middle basin could increase by more than 10 times its current
average. Together, climate changes and expansion of irrigated areas in Northeast may increase
conflicts between other water uses. In this context, public policies must be established to
promote more efficient inter -and intra- sector water allocation schemes. This study used a
regional 2010 Input-output matrix adapted for the Sub-Middle hydrographic region of the São
Francisco river basin (IO-SMSF), to simulate economic impacts accompanying changes in water
availability by economic sector in the sub-basin according to water allocation decisions. The
results indicated the extent to which water using restrictions impacts on production of highly
water dependent activities like agriculture and on local employment. The obtained results
provide a measure for the opportunity costs of using water for purposes other than the local
necessities. Keywords: Input-Output, water resources and transposition.

1. INTRODUCTION
Although Brazil has about 12% of the available fresh water on the planet, about 80% of this
water is in the Amazon, and the remaining 20% is unevenly distributed among the other regions.
Currently, irrigated agriculture in Brazil is the largest consumer of fresh water available on the
surface, with 61% of water diverted from rivers and lakes for irrigation. The largest share of
irrigated area is in the Southeast with 37%, followed by the South with 27%, 22% in the
Northeast, the Midwest and the North with 12% and 2% respectively. Despite being a naturally
dry region, and not being one of the most irrigated, the Northeast (NE) region produces about
30% of national agricultural production, only behind the South East (54%), which demonstrates
the potential of irrigation in this region (IBGE, 2006).
The São Francisco River Basin provides approximately 70 per cent of the surface water for the
Northeast of Brazil. About 95 percent of the irrigation projects in the NE region use surface
water diverted from the regional rivers, particularly the São Francisco River. The basin takes up
about 8 per cent of Brazil’s area and the river has an average annual flow of about three thousand
cubic meters per second. The basin has a diverse ecosystem with average temperatures ranging
from 20 degrees Celsius in the center-southern portion of the basin to twenty-six degrees Celsius
in the northeastern areas. The rainfall rates also differ both seasonally and in the different areas.
Because of these differences, policy makers and institutional researchers have divided the basin
into four hydrographic sub- regions: from the highlands, through a middle region and then a sub-
middle region, to sea level when it nears the ocean.
Among these hydrographic regions, the Sub-Middle (SM-SFRB) hydrographic region is the
driest one. The region (SM-SFRB) contributes to water availability in the overall basin with an
inflow of approximately 4%. The different water demands in the region represent 33% of the
entire basin. Related to the water uses / users, there is a history of a series of conflicts in this
region. Currently, the most important is that between electricity generation and irrigated
agriculture. There are important and large reservoirs that were built for electricity generation and
are essential for river control (to avoid floods and ensure navigation) and hydro electric
generation for the region.
The Sub-Middle region also includes a highly diverse agricultural system that includes well-
capitalized export-focused enterprises, medium- and small-scale commercial farmers and semi-
subsistence farmers. In Brazil as a whole, irrigated agriculture can be divided into private and
public schemes. Public schemes or projects are mostly in the northeast region (67 percent of the
total irrigated area in 1996). These are based in complex productive systems and capital and
water intensive use (CASTRO, 2011; DNOCS, 2013; CODEVASF, 2013) and in charge of two
federal institutions: Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Vale do São Francisco (CODEVASF)
and (DNOCS).
As the driest part of the basin and with conflicts already established, the SM-SFRB had all of its
sub-basins classified as critical or with an indispensable need for management, according to an
evaluation of availability and water resources demand made by the United Nations, and
publicized a decade ago in the Ten Year Plan of the São Francisco Basin Committee (CBHSF,
2004).

This conflict between irrigated agriculture and energy production has the potential to worsen
over time. Starting from the San Francisco River Basin, two channels (are being built to deliver
water to the north and the east of the region. This large water transfer project is known as the
Transboundary Project of São Francisco River (Projeto de Transposição do São Francisco -
PTSF). In response to this project, many public/ private irrigation schemes have been projected
and are expected to increase the areas under irrigation in the whole of the Northeast. The water
for the significant part of these new irrigation projects will either come directly from the San
Francisco River or from the artificial canals being constructed. There are estimates that in about
three decades, the area under irrigation supplied by that region could increase by 10 times the
number of hectares affected. This can worsen the conflict of use already existing between
irrigated agriculture and energy production (MORAES, et al., 2016).
In this context, public policies must be established to promote more efficient inter- and intra-
sector water allocation schemes. Economic models are able to support effective management
instruments that induce economically optimal and equitable allocations. It is very important that
evaluations of water allocation policies consider direct and indirect economic impacts. Different
water allocation values not only lead to different economic impacts, affecting all water users and
uses, but also have backward and forward linkages associated with the inputs and outputs of the
production cycle. Moreover, impacts need to be differentiated according to different social strata
to assess impacts on the most vulnerable and the poorest users (ROGERS et al., 1998).
The question of measurements of indirect and sector-based economic impacts of water policies
(the demand management side) is of particular importance, given the large and growing
significance of these impacts. Water policy impacts can also be compared in terms of impacts on
job creation and welfare (UNEP, 2011).
The present study used a regional Input-output matrix adapted for the Sub-Middle hydrographic
region of the São Francisco river basin (IO-SM-SFRB), to simulate direct and indirect economic
impacts from different strategies used in supply and demand management. An increase in
demand for sugarcane for ethanol production as well as a decrease in water production for
agriculture in the basin, due to transposition, were simulated and the effects of final demand and
production were measured using a regionalized Matrix.
This article presents, in addition to this introduction, four more sessions: methodology where it is
described how the regional input-ouput table was computed and how the water consumption
information was included in the matrix. The database stands for the source and treatments
applied to data. The results sections presents a discussion on the findings and the final remarks
are presented in the conclusions.

2. METHODOLOGY


2.1 Regional Input-Output Model
The input-output model is a recommended methodology for measuring economic impact taking
into consideration the inter–sectoral linkage of a given region or country. The degree of
interdependence among the sectors of an economy can be assessed through the inter-sectoral
requirement coefficients of the input-output matrix. Regional input-output matrixes can be
elaborated in two ways: by using research performed directly with data relating to the regional
economy (survey methods) and by regionalizing national input-output matrixes (non-survey
methods). Since the costs involved in direct research are prohibitive, the usual method is to resort
to regionalization procedures.
The method for regionalizing a national input-output matrix used here is the Location Quotient
(LQ) method. This mixes survey-type procedures with non-survey routines (KRONENBERG,
2009). The LQ method assumes that each regional technical coefficient aRij , is related to the
national coefficient, aN
                       ij :

                                     aRij = t ij . aN
                                                    ij                                             (1)
To estimate t ij, which quantifies       the relationship between regional and national technical
coefficients, the relative importance    of an industry is considered. This importance is determined
precisely by the Location Quotient      (LQ): LQ “(...) is a measurement that compares the relative
importance of an industry to            a region with its relative importance to the nation”
(RICHARDSON, 1978, p. 120).
This LQ is calculated as follows:
                                        EMPSBSF
                                           i
                                     ∑n      SBSF
                                      i=1 EMPi
                            LQ i =                   ⁄     EMPBR
                                                                                                   (2)
                                                              i
                                                         ∑n      BR
                                                          i=1 EMPi


Where:
           𝐸𝑀𝑃𝑖𝑆𝐵𝑆𝐹 = Number of employees in sector i in the region (SBSF)
              𝐸𝑀𝑃𝑖𝐵𝑅 = Number of employees in sector i in the country (BR).
     ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝐸𝑀𝑃𝑖𝑆𝐵𝑆𝐹 = Total employees in the region (SBSF);
        ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝐸𝑀𝑃𝑖𝐵𝑅 = Total employees in the country (BR);


However, if LQ i < 1, this means that activity “i” is underrepresented in the productive structure
of the region, in comparison with the national situation. Therefore, this region absorbs national
production in this sector, making it an importer (KRONENBERG, 2009). In Equation 1, tij is
replaced by the LQ i value calculated.
In the case where LQ i > 1, sector “i” meets local needs. In this case, and in cases where LQ i = 1,
t ij = 1: i.e. the regional technical coefficient is equal to the national one. Thus it is possible to
                                                                                                 5

industrial consumption matrix. Respectively:

The result presents a regional Input-Output matrix (MIPR). In this article, it was not necessary to
estimate the value of regional production (XR) by means of the Location Quotient, since the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) provides official regional accounts for
Brazil and for the states for 22 sectors. The municipal GDPs weighted by the gross value of
production of the regional accounts of the states of Pernambuco and Bahia were used as the
production value for the regional matrix. The RAS method was applied to correct possible
imbalances.
The Sub-Middle São Francisco River basin (SMSF) comprises 13 municipalities over two
Brazilian states: Pernambuco and Bahia. In these municipalities about 32% of the workers are
employed in rural activities. Then, water availability is essential for local economies and its
scarcity may induce important negative effects on income and jobs. In this work we will discuss
the methodology of our study, the database, and the results.
The resulting regional input-output matrix obtained from this methodology has eighteen
productive sectors, as listed below:
AT1- Temporary Agriculture
AT2- Permanent Agriculture
AT3 - Livestock, including livestock support
AT4- Forestry, fishing and aquaculture production
AT5 - Extractive Industries
AT6- Processing Industries
AT7- Electricity and gas, water, sewage, waste management and decontamination activities
AT8- Construction

The input-output model can cover extensions, incorporating the use of water. The technical
coefficients of direct water use measure the primary water use factor as input from the various
economic sectors. Using the coefficients obtained, both the Direct and Indirect Effects on the
Regional economy of the different limitations in the water input can be measured by different
allocation policies used in the basins, as described below.


2.2 Water Supply
The technical coefficients of direct water use are one of the so-called Exogenous Input
Coefficients (NAKAMURA and KONDO, 2009). Through these, it is possible to measure the
effects on the economy of a limitation in water resources, resulting from changes in the supply or
demand management of the river basins.
To obtain the technical coefficients of water use, the inputs needed for production are divided
into endogenous and exogenous inputs. The endogenous inputs are the economic ones and the
exogenous ones are the environmental inputs, in this work that is the 'water supply'.

                                           Input             z′
                             Proces = (Output ) =           ( x′i)                               (7)
                                                             w′

Where:
         x′i   = i’s Endogenous inputs;
         z′i   = i’s exogenous inputs (water);
         x′    = Production of the good x;
         w′    = Waste production.
If we divide the endogenous and exogenous inputs by the production, that is, the amount of
inputs (endogenous and exogenous) needed to produce a unit of x:
                                                x′ i
                                         ai =           ;                                        (8)
                                                 x′
                                                 z ′i
                                         bi =           .                                        (9)
                                                   x′

As all inputs, both endogenous and exogenous, are required for the production of an end product,
then assumption is made that xi > 0 and zi > 0, for all i. And, by definition, ai > 0 and bi > 0.
Rewriting:
                                     x ′ i = ai . x ′ ;                                        (10)
                                      z ′ i = bi . x ′ .                                       (11)
                                                                     ′
However, the hypothesis ai > 0 is required, which means that x i < ′, that is, the input amount
has to be less than the product amount, but this alone is not a sufficient condition. If ai ≥ 1, the
amount of product does not exceed the amount of input used in production, then the process is
not efficient. Therefore, the sufficient condition is 0 < ai < 1. Consider a model with n sectors.
Dividing the demand into the intermediate and final demand gives:

When the matrix B corresponds to water, then the application of the above equation in the input-

output model allows the calculation of virtual water [B
into account the direct and indirect needs of water in the economy. As the water-associated
element of vector B represents the direct needs of each sector, then Leontier’s matrix aggregates
the two to represent the total impact.
As the exogenous / environmental inputs are usually scarce, their supply is limited. Substituting

That is, production is limited by the water input.
Using the technical coefficients (B) and different water distributions it can be predicted the
maximum economic return, or economic production due to water. This means that we can
associate different allocations of water with different economic products by sector. In addition,
this reallocation will also cause a variation in the final demand. Rewriting Equation (19), we
have:
                                                 ̂)−1 Z

In this way, it is possible to realize that a reallocation of scarce input, water, which can be
simulated for different allocation models, resulting in different values of Z, which causes a
change in production, X, and in the final demand, Y (NAKAMURA and KONDO, 2009). This
then can be measured using the technical coefficients (vector B) and the input-output matrix of
the region (matrix A).
As the region to be evaluated is the sum of the municipalities of the Sub-Medium basin, it is
hereafter referred to as the Sub-Medium of São Francisco (SBSF). This work had the objective
of simulating the possible scenarios of water management in the SBSF (ΔZ), especially for
irrigated agriculture. Following this, to estimate the consequence on the demand (ΔY), the
production (ΔX) and employment (ΔL):

3. DATABASE
As a database to estimate the IO-SMSF we have the IO-Brazil (2010), the Brazilian Regional
Accounts 2010 and the municipal GDP from IBGE. Some procedures were adopted to aggregate
this information into tables that relate demand and supply to the eighteen sectors. The first
procedure was to aggregate the 53 sectors of the national input-output matrix to the 18 sectors of
our study.
The information for the Brazilian VBP is available in the National Accounts System, while the
information for the states of Pernambuco and Bahia can be found in the Regional Accounts. The
two pieces of information were already available for the new GDP calculation methodology. To
estimate the VBP of the sectors in the Municipal Accounts, the procedure was somewhat
different. This is because there is no information available for the Gross Value of Municipal
Production, neither by sector nor by aggregate. The assumption adopted here was that the
technology employed in each sector in the regions was similar to the technology employed in the
state. Thus, the participation of the Intermediate Consumption Sector in the sector's VBP for the
State would be similar to the municipalities. On the basis of this hypothesis:
                                                   VBPE
                                         VBPiR =      i

                                                       i

Where VBPiR is the value to be estimated for the VBP of sector i in the region R. VPBiE is the
VBP of sector i in Pernambuco (or Bahia) and VAEi is the Value Added by sector i in
Pernambuco (or Bahia), both available in the Regional Accounts. , VARi is the Added Value for
sector i in region R. Information on VA in municipalities was available aggregated for four
sectors (Agriculture and Livestock, Industries, Services and Public Administration). Thus, the
estimation was made considering these sectors. After using the Location Quotient method, we
obtained the regional coefficient matrix, the regional product vector, and the regional inter-
industry consumption matrix.
The direct coefficients of water use were identified for irrigated agriculture, livestock, industry
and services. To estimate the direct coefficients of water use for irrigated agriculture in the
region, the Technical Coefficients Matrix for Water Resources published by FEBRABAN in
2011 was used as the basis. For livestock, the coefficient of withdrawal per animal (liters/day)
per type of animal published by Funarbe, 2011 was used. This coefficient was applied to the
number of heads for the municipalities of the SBSF. For all other sectors, the IWE-MAIN
coefficient applied to the number of persons employed by sector (in the municipalities of the
SBSF) as published in the 2010 IBGE demographic census was used.

 4. RESULTS

 The sectors that generated the largest production in the region are: public administration,
 manufacturing industry and agriculture (sum of temporary agriculture, permanent and livestock).
 However, the sectors that use the most amount of water (Z) are the agricultural ones, as
 expected. All sectors together consumes 29% of water flow. agricultural alone accounted for
 approximately 27% of this flow. Table 2 presents the main results of IOM-SBSF 2010.

 The agriculture and livestock sectors are the ones that use the most water in the SBSF, with the
 highest direct coefficients (B). Therefore, these are the sectors that present the greatest Virtual
 Water consumption (Total effect). High-user non-agricultural sectors include food and domestic
 services. The manufacturing industry stands out among the non-agricultural sectors in relation to
 Virtual Water use. Despite its low direct coefficient, both its participation in production and
 large indirect effect increases its weight on the Virtual Water effect.

The SBSF Region is a major exporter of fruit (Sector 2, Permanent Agriculture), and potential
producer of sugar cane (Sector 1, Temporary Agriculture). To understand the direct and indirect
effects of the increase in demand in this sector, assuming an increase in exports, for example, the
impact of this increase (1 R$ million more in the demand for this sector) is shown in Table 3.

Analyzing the impact on product (third column on Table 3), an increase of 1 R$ million in the
demand for permanent agriculture would generate a total increase in the product of 1.31 R$
million for the local economy. That is, 1.00 million for the sector itself. In the case of production,
this would spread not to the agricultural sectors, but to the non-agricultural ones: The
manufacturing industry (0.105 R$ million), commerce (0.054 R$ million) and electricity (0.04
R$ million).
With regard to the employment generated (fourth column on Table 3), almost all the effect is on
the sector itself. The demand shock would generate a total of 95 jobs, of which 86 would be in
the sector itself. Others for the sectors, temporary agriculture, livestock, commerce and services.
For effect on virtual water (final column on Table 3), the demand shock would generate a total
impact of 850.07 million m3 of water (27 m3 /sec).

In addition to the demand shock, we simulated the supply shock on the exogenous water supply.
In this case, we supposed a decrease in the available water for the productive sectors of the São
Francisco sub-middle basin as a consequence of the river transposition.
As mentioned above, the project of integration of the São Francisco River (PISF), a project of the
Federal Government, was conceived with the objective of guaranteeing water supply for the
semi-arid region of the four States of the Northern Northeast (Paraíba, Pernambuco, Rio Grande
do Norte and Ceará). Two hydraulic systems are being built (North Axis and East Axis) and will
be operated and maintained by the Parnaíba and São Francisco Valley Development Company -
The North Axis has an extension of about 400 kilometers and is composed of three pumping
systems with a total height of 169 m and is designed for a maximum capacity of 99 m³/s. The
North Axis will operate with a continuous flow of 16.4 m³/s. The East Axis has an extension of
about 220 kilometers to the Paraíba River and its storage in the Itaparica reservoir, for a
maximum capacity of 28 m³/s, the East Axis will operate with a continuous flow of 10 m³/s
(CASTRO, 2011).
The supply shocks for the water input are considered in this work based on the scenarios
designed by Silva (2017) when estimating the post-implementation demand curve of the PISF
considering the costs of transposition. Silva (2017) determines three scenarios: the Baseline
scenario that predicts a continuous withdrawal of 26.4 m³/s, scenario A2 that predicts an increase
in average withdrawal flow of 86 m³/s, and scenario B1 an increase in average flow to 76.5 m³/s.
The municipalities of the sub-middle region downstream from the Sobradinho dam, which is
likely to be the direct source of water destined for the new axes. To simulate this competition,
two scenarios are drawn here from the Sobradinho dam flow.

The first scenarios for years that have more rain are the shocks: Baseline, A2 and B1 on a
concession of 1300 m³/s for the Sobradinho dam. The second driest scenario considers the same
shocks for a concession of 700 m³/s. The table below represents these shocks to water supply
over the total water used in the sub-average São Francisco.

  Table 5 presents the results impact on the Final Demand, Product and Employment if this water
  restriction were only applied to the agricultural sectors. The reduction of water availability to the
  agricultural sectors would cause a decrease in demand, in the sense that there would be less
  water for crops. That in turn would also cause a drop in production and employment.

  As expected, the effect on the production (ΔX) is greater than the effect on demand (ΔY) due to
  inter-sectorial relations. The effect on employment (ΔEMP) follows the same logic as the effect
  on production (ΔX), a fall in the availability of water for agriculture would cause a decrease in
  the number of jobs for the agricultural sectors.
  This reduction in the supply of water also affected all productive sectors of the sub-region of São
  Francisco, and not only to the agricultural sectors. The effect is greater on temporary agriculture
  than on permanent agriculture, which is what requires the high water requirement of temporary
  crops, in space Sugarcane.
  Table 6 presents the results of this shock on the final demand (ΔY), production (ΔX) and the
  employment (ΔEMP). The drop in total demand for the São Francisco sub-basin would range
  between R$237 million and R$1,434 million. And since all sectors would be affected by the
  water scarcity, the sectors that suffer the greatest shock on the final demand are the most
  important sectors for the region (Table 2): Public Administration, Manufacturing and trade.
  The same logic applies to production and employment. The fall in production would range
  between R $ 310 million and R $ 1,874 million. This represents a variation between 2% and 12%
  on the total production in the region, demonstrating the importance of water resources. Job
  availability reflects on the generation of income and the well-being of the population of the
  region in general. In the worst case scenario, a drop in water supply could result in 48,198 fewer
  jobs.

         5. CONCLUSION
         The Brazilian government's policy of expanding irrigated areas, especially in the Northeast of
         Brazil, tends to increase competition for water resources. From the regional input-output matrix
         adapted to the sub-river basin region of the São Francisco River, it was possible to simulate
         economic impact from changes in water available. Considering only the productive sectors with
         license for use, our study showed agriculture and livestock to be the sectors with the highest
         coefficient of withdrawal, but they would not be the only ones affected by the reduction of
         available water, as a result of the São Francisco River transposition, for example. Even if the
         restriction applies only to the agricultural sectors, the damage to the region would expand to all
         sectors. Evaluating the effects of this restriction on other sectors included of the matrix, the
         impact would be even greater, reaching 12% in the fall of production, and a total of 48,198 fewer
         jobs, across all sectors. The scarcity of water in the semi-arid region of the Brazilian Northeast
         certainly represents a hurdle for the development of that region, but the transfer of water from
         another region does not necessarily mean expansion of the supply of water to the two regions if
         water is limited and already suffers from competition between allowed and non-allowed uses.
