      In this paper, we investigate the dynamic relationship between economic growth and in-
      come inequality, an issue that has not found yet a clear consensus in the literature. In
      particular, we implement a panel VAR approach, using state-level data for Brazil, to as-
      sess the dynamic effects of inequality on growth and vice versa. We show that inequality
      shocks lead to higher economic growth, therefore supporting the view that, in poor coun-
      tries, higher inequality does benefit economic growth. We also present evidence that higher
      growth leads to lower income inequality, consequently pursuing growth enhancing policies
      should be translated not only in higher growth, but also in better income distribution. Our
      results are robust to different inequality measures and also when we include a measure of
      human capital accumulation.

      crescimento leva a uma menor desigualdade de renda, consequentemente, ao se buscar
      políticas que beneficiem o crescimento, os resultados devem ser traduzidos não apenas em
      maior crescimento, mas também em uma melhor distribuição de renda. Nossos resultados
      são robustos para diferentes medidas de desigualdade e também quando incluímos uma

1     Introduction
The relationship between income inequality and economic growth is a long standing issue in
Macroeconomics. On the one hand, some authors have found that higher income inequality is
beneficial to growth (Partridge, 1997; Galor & Tsiddon, 1997; Li & Zou, 1998; Forbes, 2000) and
more recently Brueckner & Lederman (2015) and Cavalcanti & Giannitsarou (2016). On the
other hand, there is evidence of a negative relationship with higher inequality being associated
with lower growth (Alesina & Perotti, 1996; Persson & Tabellini, 1994; Atems & Jones, 2015).
In this paper, we explore the dynamic relationship between income inequality and economic
growth, using state-level data for Brazil, a country known by its high level of income disparities.
In particular, we investigate what are the effects of shocks to income inequality on growth and
vice versa.
    In order to investigate this issue, we employ a Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) approach
and estimate a bivariate PVAR using a measure of income inequality (Gini coefficient) and
income data (real GDP per capita). As in traditional Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) models,
the PVAR model is quite flexible and allow us to treat both variables as endogenous. However,
PVAR models have an additional advantage over traditional VARs, the possibility to account
for time invariant characteristics intrinsic to each unit in our sample. Moreover, given the short
time length of our data set, this methodology exploits the panel structure of the data (short T
and large N) that is not reliable in a traditional VAR estimation. Orthogonal impulse-response
functions (IRFs) are obtained by means of a triangular identification scheme by assuming that
real output per capita does not respond contemporaneously to inequality shocks.1
    Our results show that after an inequality shock the growth rate of real GDP per capita
improves and hence higher inequality is beneficial to growth.The effects on the growth rate last
for at least 3 years after the initial shock, changing real GDP per capita permanently (level
effect).2 On the other hand, an income shock (i.e. higher GDP growth) is followed by better
income distribution (i.e. after a GDP shock income inequality declines). These results are
robust when we use a different inequality measure (e.g. Theil Index).
    We extend our analysis by estimating a three-variable PVAR to include a measure of human
capital. We do this for two purposes. First, to capture the idea that higher economic growth
may lower income inequality through higher human capital accumulation (Brueckner et al.,
2015).3 Second, adding a measure of human capital allows us to investigate whether the effects
of inequality shocks are indeed a result of a third factor, in our case, shocks to human capital.
Our results are robust to introducing human capital.
    This paper is related, more directly, to the branch of the literature that investigates the
empirical relationship between income inequality and economic growth (Atems & Jones, 2015;
Brueckner et al., 2015; Brueckner & Lederman, 2015). Atems & Jones (2015) also employ a
PVAR model and show that higher inequality reduces income level and growth in US states.
Brueckner et al. (2015), using a panel of 154 countries spanning 1960-2007, show that higher
economic growth is associated with lower inequality. Brueckner & Lederman (2015) estimates
the effect of income inequality on real gross domestic product per capita using a panel of 104
countries during the period 1970–2010. They find that, on average, income inequality has a
1
   We will discuss the validity of this restriction in section 3.
2
   Galor & Zeira (1993) propose a model where under credit market imperfections and indivisibilities in invest-
  ment in human capital, higher inequality affects real GDP per capita positively in the short run as well as in
  the long run.
3
  For instance, Galor & Zeira (1993) argues that, when credit markets are imperfect, higher aggregate income
  are associated with lower inequality. However, the channel through which the effects of higher income are
  transmitted to inequality is through higher physical capital accumulation.

significant negative effect on gross domestic product per capita growth and the long-run level
of gross domestic product per capita. However, they show that the impact differ by the level
of economic development. In particular, in poor countries, income inequality has a significant
positive effect on gross domestic product per capita.
    The results that higher income inequality can be beneficial to economic growth are in
line with the theoretical work by Galor & Zeira (1993). They show that the relationship
between inequality and aggregate output in the presence of credit market imperfections and
indivisibilities in human capital investment varies across countries initial income levels. While,
in rich economies, we should expect a negative relationship between inequality and growth, in
poor countries, higher income inequality may be associated with higher economic growth and
higher real GDP per capita.4 This is the result presented in Brueckner & Lederman (2015)
and also showed in this paper. Cavalcanti & Giannitsarou (2016), using a concept of network,
show that the relationship between growth and inequality is also positive for a given network
structure. They show that when the network cohesion is low, the more likely it is to have high
growth and inequality in the long run.5
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give the details on
the dataset used. In section 3 we present our empirical methodology. Section 4 discusses the
results. Finally, conclusions are presented in section 5.


2     Data
Our income per capita measure is the real GDP per capita from Instituto de Pesquisa e Econo-
mia Aplicada (IPEA), while we use two measures of income inequality: a Gini coefficient and
Theil index, both from IPEA database. All data ranges from 1992 to 2011.6 Real state-level
GDP is in constant Brazilian Real (R$ 2010). Our measure of human capital accumulation is
the average years of schooling for adults who are 25 years of age or older. This is computed as
the ratio of the sum of the number of years of study completed by people who are 25 years of
age or older and the number of people in this age group. Figure 1 presents the data used in
the estimation.
4
    The rationale for the positive relationship between inequality and growth is that under imperfect credit
  markets, higher inequality channels more resources towards people with higher marginal propensity to save
  and hence increases capital accumulation and promotes growth.
5
  Network cohesion is a network statistics that can be interpreted as a measure of how uniform or fragmented a
  network is. See Cavalcanti & Giannitsarou (2016) for details.
6
  For some years (1994, 2000 and 2010) Gini coefficients were not available. For these years, we implement a
  linear interpolation.

3    Methodology
The dynamic relationship among our endogenous variables can be represented as:

               Yit = φi + A(`)Yt−l + δt + uit                                 i = 1, ..., 27 t = 1992, ..., 2011                   (1)


                                                                          4
where Yit = [∆GDPit , Giniit ]0 is a κ × 1 vector of endogenous variables for unit (state) i at time
t, φi is a κ×1 vector of time-invariant state fixed effects, δt represents unobservable time effects,
A(`) are κ × κ matrices of lagged coefficients. The fixed effects capture any differences across
states that are time invariant (e.g. cost of living, climate, etc.). Finally, uit ∼ iid(0, Σu ) is a
κ × 1 vector of reduced form idiosyncratic disturbances with a nonsingular variance-covariance
matrix, Σu .
    Pooled fixed effects estimation is one possible way to estimate the parameters of the model
(1). However, even when N is large, but T is fixed, the pooled estimator is biased. We
implement a "Helmet procedure" and employ a GMM approach of Arellano & Bover (1995),
which is consistent even when T is small.7 . The procedure implements a transformation to
eliminate the individual fixed-effects. Therefore, before estimation, we rewrite equation (1) in
terms of forward orthogonal deviations denoted by:
                                                           r

                                      ȳ¯it = (yit − yit )                                         (2)

where Tit is the number of available future observations for state i at time t and yit is its average.
Applying this transformation to our endogenous variables, allow us to rewrite the system (1)
as:

                        Ȳ¯it = A(`)Ȳ¯t−1 + δt + uit      i = 1, ..., 27 t = 1992, ..., 2011             (3)
    The transformed variables in Equation (3) are orthogonal to the original variables and hence
the latter can be used as instruments.
    To achieve identification, we assume real GDP per capita (or its growth rate) does not
respond contemporaneously to an inequality shock within the year. Therefore the variance-
covariance matrix of the residuals, Σu , takes the form of a lower-triangular matrix with ∆GDP
entering first in the Yi,t vector. This identifying restriction is justified based on the fact that
real income is used in the computation of the Gini coefficients, so we would expect that any
change in real income will be translated to the Gini coefficient contemporaneously, but not the
reverse. That is, changes in Gini coefficient will take at least one year to affect real income
(Atems & Jones, 2015).
    For the purpose of recovering impulse response functions, equation (3) can be rewritten as
B(`)Ȳ¯it = uit , where B(`) = (Ik − A(`)). As long as all eingenvalues of A(`) have modulus less
than 1, B(`) satisfies the stability condition and hence is invertible. Therefore, we can obtain
a MA representation of the PVAR model

                                                    Ȳ¯i,t = Θ(`)uit ,                                    (4)

where Θ(`) = ∞           j        −1
              P
                j=0 Θj l ≡ B(`) . The disturbances uit are correlated contemporaneously and
hence we implement a Cholesky decomposition on Σu = P 0 P , where P is a lower-triangular
matrix, such that it is possible to orthogonalize disturbances as P −1 uit ≡ eit . The vector eit will
be the orthogonalized disturbances, which it will give us the orthogonalized impulse-response
functions.
7
    The bias is due to the fact that unit specific intercepts, φi , are correlated with the error term.

4     Results
First, we present the results for a variety of panel unit tests.8 Second, we present the Impulse
Response Functions (IRFs) from our baseline bivariate PVAR specification. Finally, we extend
our analysis by introducing a measure of human capital. We do this for two purposes. First,
to capture the idea that higher economic growth may lower income inequality through higher
human capital accumulation (Brueckner et al., 2015). Second, to investigate whether the effects
of inequality shocks are indeed a result of a third factor, in our case, shocks to human capital.

4.1     Panel Unit Root Tests
Table 1 presents the results of different panel unit root tests. Testing unit roots in context of
panel data is not as straightforward as in usual time series analysis, but the idea is similar.9
Consider a variable that can be represented by a single panel-data model with a first-order
autoregressive representation such as:

                                          xit = ρi xi,t−1 + Wit0 γi + it                                       (5)

where xit is the variable being tested, the term Wit can represent panel-specific means and/or
a time trend. Typically, most tests evaluates the null H0 : ρi = 1. However, a more common
approach is to rewrite the test equation 5 as:

                                         ∆xit = ρi xi,t−1 + Wit0 γi + it                                       (6)

and to test, alternatively, H0 : ρi = 0, where ∆xit is the variable being tested in first differences.
The specific form of the null hypothesis varies across test, while in Levin-Lin-Chu (LLC) test,
Harris-Tzavalis (HT) test, Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) test and Fisher (ADF type) test the null is
of nonstationarity, in Hadri’s test, the null is that all panels are stationary.
    We perform each test on the level and on the first difference of each variable in our sample.
Therefore, in deciding whether the variable will enter the PVAR model in level or in first
differences we take into account the panel unit root test results. Additionally, we also compute
the eigenvalues of the A(`) matrix to check whether the PVAR model has a stable moving
average representation.
    A visual inspection of Figure 1 suggests a time trend is present in all variables in levels, so
in performing unit root tests we allow for a time trend, while the lag length choices are based
on the Akaike Information Criterion when possible. Table 1 presents the results of the panel
unit root tests.
8
   We also check the stability condition, i.e., whether the eingenvalues of the matrix of estimated coefficients are
  strictly less than one. Figure 9 in appendix presents a graphical representation of this condition.

            Note: Reported values are t statistics and p values are presented in parentheses. Except for Hadri’s test, the null
           hypothesis is for the presence of unit roots. Tests differ in the exact specification of the null and alternative hypothesis.


    For the level of real GDP per capita, HT test, IPS test, Fisher test and Hadri’s stationarity
test indicate non-stationarity. Only LLC test indicates that the level of real GDP per capita
is stationary. When the same tests are performed on the first difference, the hypothesis of
stationarity cannot be reject at 5% level. Therefore, we will use real GDP per capita in first
differences.
    For inequality measures (Gini coefficient and Theil index), in four tests (LLC, HT, IPS
and Fisher) the null of non-stationarity can be rejected at 5% level. However, the results for
Hadri’s stationarity test show opposite results, rejecting the null of stationarity. Therefore,
in our baseline specification, the inequality measure will enter in level, but we will also use a
specification in first differences to assess the robustness of our results.
    Finally, for our measure of human capital, Fisher’s test and Hadri’s test consistently indicate
that this variable is not stationary. Therefore, we will use schooling in first differences in our
PVAR models.10
10
      We also tested PVAR models using schooling in level, but the models failed to satisfy the stability condition
     and hence did not present a stable moving average representation.

4.2     Impulse Responses
We have used multivariate versions of standard Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian
Information Criteria (BIC) to determine the lag length in our PVAR model. The AIC indicated
a model with three lags, while the BIC a model with only one lag. Our choice was to use the
most parsimonious model (Andrews & Lu, 2001; Abrigo et al., 2016). Next we present the
results regarding our estimated Impulse Response Functions.

4.2.1    Economic Growth and Income Inequality
The results of our baseline specification show that the effects of income shocks on inequality
are "positive", but short-lived. That is, in response to a one standard-deviation increase in
real GDP per capita growth, income inequality falls and stays below its steady-state value for
one-year.11
    On the other hand, the effects of inequality shocks are a little more persistent. After a
positive inequality shock (i.e. higher inequality), the growth rate of real GDP per capita
increases and remains above its steady-state level for almost three years. Although the effects
of inequality shocks on the growth rate are short lived, there is a permanent, level effect, on
real GDP per capita.12
    Brueckner et al. (2015) in the context of instrumental regressions in a traditional panel
model for a large sample of countries, controlling for country and time fixed effects, show that
higher real GDP have a significant moderating effect on income inequality. In the context of
PVAR models, Atems & Jones (2015) also obtain that an income shock leads to lower inequality
as we do in this paper. However, differently from Atems & Jones, our results indicate that after
an inequality shock, real GDP growth improves in Brazil. Brueckner & Lederman (2015) obtain
a similar result in instrumental regressions using a panel of countries and controlling for initial
level of country’s income. They show that, in poor countries, higher income inequality is
beneficial to economic growth.
    In a theoretical framework, Galor & Zeira (1993) show that higher inequality benefits growth
by enhancing higher capital accumulation in an economy with credit market imperfections,
which it seems to be the case in Brazil. As saving rates depend positively on wealth, higher
inequality channels more resources towards people with high marginal propensity to save, in-
creasing capital accumulation, and fostering higher growth.13
11
   The short duration of real income shocks is due to the short lag length of our PVAR model.
12
    It is important to notice that inequality may increase because the poor becomes poorer and/or the rich
   becomes richer. Although this might be interesting in itself, our data does not allows us to make this
   differentiation.
13
    However, inequality may also hurt growth. In wealthier economies, more equality alleviates the adverse effects
   of credit constraints on human capital formation and hence lead to higher growth when human capital is an
   engine of growth (Galor & Moav, 2004).

    Using our inequality measure in first differences does not alter the results. In response to
an inequality shock (a shock to its growth rate), the growth rate of real GDP per capita still
increases. Similarly, in response to an income shock, the growth rate of the Gini coefficient
falls. Figure 3 presents these results.

4.2.2   Growth, Inequality and Human Capital
We check our baseline results by extending our PVAR model to include a measure of human
capital. The rationale is that higher economic growth may lower income inequality through
higher human capital accumulation (Brueckner et al., 2015). Figures 4 to 6 present the results
of this exercise. The difference among them is the entry order in the PVAR model.
    In Figure 4, we assume real GDP per capita growth enters first, followed by education and
then by Gini coefficient. Under this specification, an income shock still lowers inequality but at
a lower extent. Our measure of human capital first declines and then increases after the income
shock, before returning to its steady-state level.
    When we look at the effects of inequality shocks, real GDP still increases as in our baseline
specification. However, the mechanism proposed by Galor (2011) that, in poor countries, higher
income inequality leads to higher human capital accumulation does not seem to be at work in
Brazil, as after an inequality shock human capital accumulation declines. The figure also shows
that an education shock does not alter the rate of economic growth, but increases inequality.

    Figure 5 presents the IRF’s in a model where education enters first and it is followed by
real GDP per capita growth and then by Gini coefficient. The result that an income shock
lowers inequality and an inequality shock enhances growth are still present. The same is true
in the model when real GDP per capita enters first, followed by Gini coefficient and then by
education. Figure 6 presents these results.

4.3           Alternative Inequality Measure
A second robustness exercise is to re-estimate our PVAR model using an alternative inequality
measure - a Theil index. Figures 7 and 8 present the results using this alternative measure
in levels and in first differences, respectively. Overall, our baseline results are robust when we
change the inequality measure.

5    Conclusion
In this paper, we argue that there is no clear consensus in the literature on the dynamic
relationship between income inequality and economic growth. We explore this issue by means
of a Panel VAR approach, using state-level data for Brazil spanning 1992-2011. We show that
inequality is beneficial to growth, that is, after an inequality shock, the growth rate of real
GDP per capita increases and stays above its steady state level for at least three years. The
temporary change in the growth rate, changes the level of real GDP per capita permanently.
On the other hand, after a positive income shock inequality declines. These results are robust
either using a different inequality measure (e.g. Theil Index) or by estimating a three-variable
PVAR to include a measure of human capital.
    The result that higher inequality is beneficial to growth is in line with theoretical analy-
sis by Galor & Zeira (1993) that show that higher inequality benefits growth by enhancing
higher capital accumulation in an economy with credit market imperfections. As saving rates
depend positively on wealth, higher inequality channels more resources towards people with
high marginal propensity to save, increasing capital accumulation, and fostering higher growth.
    In sum, we see our results as offering a positive (empirical) analysis of the dynamic re-
lationship between growth and inequality. This is not to say we should pursue policies that
increase inequality in order to foster higher growth. On the contrary, as we have shown, the
relationship is not symmetric, as higher growth lowers inequality. Therefore, pursing growth

distribution.
