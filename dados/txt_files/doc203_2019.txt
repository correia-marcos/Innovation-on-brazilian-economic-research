Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of racial inequalities in human capital formation in Brazil
using data on children from their birth to 22 years old. We document racial inequalities in birth
outcomes, years of schooling and socioemotional skills. Particularly for years of completed schooling,
we observe increasing black-white unconditional gaps that start in half an year of schooling when
children are 11 years old and grow to reach 1.3 years when children are 22 years old. When we
condition the gap on previous schooling, together with a host of other control variables, we only
observe significant gaps at ages 11 and 15, but no racial gaps at ages 18 and 22, which is evidence that
the gap is formed early in life. The most important variables explaining the racial gap in schooling are
family income, maternal education, number of prenatal visits, maternal smoking during pregnancy,
and maternal mental health.

1       Introduction
    Although many studies still find evidence of discriminatory behavior in the labor market1 , some
authors highlight the importance of differences in skills and schooling as one of the major determi-
nants of the wage gap between black and white workers. In the United States, both Heckman (2011)
and Fryer (2011) suggest that public policy aiming at reducing racial economic disparities should
focus on closing the gap in skills. Similarly, the Brazilian literature have pointed out that, contrary
to what happens with respect to gender gaps in wages, a considerable part of differences in wages
between black and white workers can be explained by observable differences in attributes, including
schooling and test scores (Oliveira and Rios-Neto, 2006; Matos and Machado, 2006; Arraes et al.,
2014; Curi and Menezes-Filho, 2014). A better understanding of how racial differences in skills and
human capital emerge is thus crucial for reducing inequality in the labor market.
    The Brazilian literature on human capital formation has collected evidence that there exist racial
inequalities between black and white students in school attainment and test scores that do not vanish
even when we control for a large set of covariates. For instance, Barros et al. (2001) find that Brazilian
black students have 0,54 less years of schooling than their white counterpart. Menezes-Filho (2007)
and Matos and Machado (2006) also find that black students have lower performance in math test
score. Portella et al. (2017) show that black students have larger age-grade distortion and higher
chances of ever failing a grade. These studies, however, only include a racial dummy as a control
variable and do not deal particularly with issues of race nor do they try to explain the sources of
these racial inequalities.
    Among the studies that try to uncover the reasons why Brazilian black students perform worse
than white students are Soares and Alves (2003) and Soares (2006), who find that white students
benefit more from better school structure. Simões and Ferrão (2005) observe a negative correlation
between performance and self-evaluation of students. Since black students have lower self-evaluation,
they point out that this can be a factor behind their relative poorer performance. Flores and
Scorzafave (2014) find evidence that segregation and discrimination play a role in determining the
lower scores of black students. Botelho et al. (2015) compare test scores of student in their schools
with their scores in color-blind, standardized exams. They find a bias in grading by teachers against
black students. This bias decrease with longer contact between student and teacher, supporting
the existence of statistical discrimination. Rangel (2015) studies the possible effect that anticipated
market discrimination can have on parental investments in their children’s human capital. Using
a within-family approach he finds that darker-skin children have lower chances of being enrolled in
school between 5 and 14 years old. For co-residing children between 17 and 25 years old, darker-skin
children are 5.7% less likely to have finished primary school, and the affect seems to be larger for
boys, in line with observable returns to schooling. Marteleto and Dondero (2016) follow a similar
strategy of observing variation within family, although they consider the case of twins between 12
and 18 years old that differ in their racial classification. Their twins fixed-effects estimation shows
that children with darker complexion have on average 0.3 less years of study than their white siblings.
Again, the effect is larger among boys.
    Despite having different racial ideology than Brazil2 , the literature on racial inequalities in the
United States may offer some insights on the possible reasons that help explain differences between
black and white students. One important finding of this literature is that racial gaps in skills emerge
quite soon in early childhood and widens during the first years of schooling. This, in turn, hinders
long-term investment in human capital later in life. For instance, Fryer and Levitt (2013) observe
differences in mental ability between black and white infants as young as 2 years old. Fryer and Levitt
    1
     Audit and correspondence studies show that black applicant have lower return calls than their white counterparts.
See for instance Heckman (1998); Guryan and Charles (2013). Hirata and Soares (2016) find evidence of taste
discrimination in Brazil.

(2004) are able to close the gap in cognitive tests for children enrolled in kindergarten after controlling
for a series of covariates, but show that the gap starts growing after first grade, widening throughout
the schooling years. Carneiro et al. (2005) summarize a series of papers showing that the racial gap
in skills emerge early in life and present novel evidence on this matter for both cognitive and non-
cognitive skills for the United States. Todd and Wolpin (2007) estimate a production function that
allow for lagged inputs, parents’ ability and unobserved endowments to affect cognitive achievement.
They use their model to study racial gaps in test scores and find that mother’s AFQT3 account for
most of the gap, together with differences in home inputs. Moreover, equalizing home inputs would
close the gap in math and reading scores by 10-20%. Finally, Cameron and Heckman (2001) use a
dynamic model of schooling choice to evaluate how income and family characteristics in early stages
of life affect the chances of minorities students entering college in the United States. They find
that the gap between races is closed and sometimes even reverted when the endowments of black
students is equalized to that of white students. Including AFQT scores reduces the importance
of family characteristics, particularly in later years of schooling. They conclude that short-term
constraints are not as important in determining entrance in college as the long-term influence that
family income and characteristics has through the formation of skills that prepare children to college.
    Similarly, differences in health in early childhood may also explain part of the gap between black
and white children. Chay et al. (2009, 2014) argue that improvements in health services available
to black people during the 1960’s were responsible for the convergence in test scores observed in the
1980’s. The end of segregation in Southern states made better hospitals available to black people,
leading to better health indicators for newborns. The improvement in test scores in the 1980’s
was concentrated precisely in those states and cannot be explained by other factors, such as school
quality or family environment.
    The main objective of this paper is to shed light on the dynamics of racial gaps in human
capital in Brazil. We use a unique database that follows children from birth until 22 years old to
investigate the evolution of human capital formation and how it differs between black and white
children. We evaluate the relative importance of in uterus investments, birth outcomes, maternal
psychological health, and previous achievement in explaining black-white gaps in schooling, from
adolescence through early adulthood. Black and white children already differ when they are born,
with black newborns weighting on average around 80 grams (0.15 standard deviations) less then
white newborns. Differences in observables explain almost half of this gap.
    We document growing racial gaps in years of schooling as children age. The unconditional gap
in schooling is half a year when children are 11 years old (.41 standard deviations - SD) and grow
to 1.3 years of schooling (.44 SD) when they are 22 years old. This increasing absolute difference
between black and white children hide two important caveats: i) the normalized unconditional racial
gap4 is quite stable throughout the period, around 0,4 for all ages; ii) conditional on previous school
attainment and other covariates, the racial gap cease to be significant after age 15, meaning that
black-white differences in schooling are mostly determined up to that age. We also find racial gaps in
socioemotional skills at age 11, measured using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ),
but we are not able to assess its dynamics since we only observe this score one period.
    Previous education is the main determinant of years of education, highlighting the cumulative
nature of skills and the importance of early investments. Families’ socioeconomic status (SES)
at the time children were born and when they are 11-years-old are the main factors behind the
differences in schooling through their impact on years of schooling at age 11. In uterus investments
and mother’s psychological health also play a role in explaining these differences. Although there
exist unexplained racial inequalities in birth weight, and birth weight is correlated with schooling
when children are 11, it does not seem to account for much of the racial gap in schooling.

    We also investigate whether the dynamics of the gap vary according to families SES, based on
per capita family income and maternal education by the time of delivery, and by gender. We observe
that the dynamics of the gap change across socioeconomic groups, with significant conditional racial
gaps among children in high favorable at the age 22, while such conditional gap is not significant
for the whole population. We interpret these results as suggesting that black children may face
barriers to finish high school and enter college that are not present for white children, and it is only
significant among those with high SES because only families in the highest socioeconomic group are
able to support the studies of their children past high school. Moreover, the racial gap grows much
faster for boys between 11 and 15 years old, whereas for girls the racial gap grows continuously,
although it reaches the same level as among boys by the age of 22.
    This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the data and discuss the theoretical background
in which we conduct our empirical analysis. In Section 3 we discuss the main results, starting with
racial differences in birth outcomes, then moving to differences in schooling and SDQ scores, and
finally evaluating the evolution of racial gaps from 15 to 22 years. In section 4 we evaluates possible
heterogeneities in the dynamics of the black-white gap in attained education based on family SES
and gender. Finally, in Section 5 we conclude and discuss possible policy implication.


2       Methods and data
2.1     Data
    Data comes from the Pelotas’ 1993 Cohort Study, collected by the Research Center of Epidemiol-
ogy from the Universidade Federal de Pelotas5 . These data follow every children born in the town of
Pelotas in the year of 1993. They contain information collected on many rounds of interviews with
more than 5 thousand children since they were born up to 22 years old. The variables cover a wide
range of themes, including mother’s habits during pregnancy, family characteristics, physical and
psychological health indicators, information on education and labor market participation, among
other topics. Here we limit our analysis to five rounds of this survey: soon after children were born
(perinatal) and when children were 11, 15, 18, and 22 years old6
    From the round of interviews in 2004 (when children were 11 years old) we obtain information
regarding children’s self-identified racial identity. Each children interviewed had to select one of the
following items as their race or skin color: a) white, b) black, c) brown, d) yellow (Asian), and
e) indigenous7 . We focus exclusively on children who classify themselves as being white, black or
brown, and join together the black and brown categories into a non-white category. This restriction
leaves us with a sample of 4212 children out of the original 5249, as can be seem in Table 1. This
table also displays the sample sizes under many criteria, together with the relative size of this sample
with respect to the original number of observations. Due to attrition, 27% of the original sample is
lost when children complete 22 years. This value increases to one third when we exclude individuals
that self-classified as either yellow or indigenous. Finally due to missing values in variables included
in the regressions, the sample is reduced by around 50%.
    Table 2 provides descriptive statistics regarding differences between white and non-white indi-
viduals in the cohort of 1993. We observe that non-white children lag behind in every measure
of human capital displayed. This includes birth weight, scores from the Strength and Difficulties
Questionnaires (SDQ)8 , and years of completed schooling. Black children are born nearly 90 grams

      Details of this research are available in Victora et al. (2006).

      We also have access to data from surveys conducted when children were 6, 12 and 48 months old, but these data
is available only for 20% of the total sample.

lighter and by age 11 they have 0.28 SD lower scores on SDQ. Absolute differences in years of school-
ing grow with time, from half a year at age 11 to 1.3 years when they are 22 years old. However,
these racial differences in schooling are almost stable in terms of standard deviations, varying from
0.46 SD at 11, to 0.57 SD when they are 15, then dropping to 0.48 SD when they are 22 (using as
reference the standard deviation among white children). At the same time that we observe consid-
erable differences in outcomes between non-white and white children, we also observe differences in
backgrounds between them. Even before black children are born, they are already disadvantaged, as
we can see by the number of prenatal appointments mothers had and whether or not they smoked
cigarettes during pregnancy. Mothers of black children are also younger, have lower education and
report more mental health problems (measure by the Self-Reporting Questionnaire with 20 items -
SRQ-209 ). Families of black children are larger and poorer than their white counterparts. Although
we do not include in our descriptive analysis, we also have data on mother’s health during pregnancy
(whether or not she had any abortion threat, anemia, urinary infection, high pressure, or diabetes),
number of previous children (parity), whether any previous birth was low birth weight (LBW) or
premature, mother’s height and body mass index (BMI) before the pregnancy, gestational weight
gain, whether the mother worked during pregnancy, whether any partner lived with her during preg-
nancy and when the child was 11 years old, and hospital of delivery. Other outcomes at birth apart
from weight are also available, such as baby’s length, head, thoracic, and abdominal circumferences,
gestation length, Dubowitz score10 , and whether the child was taken to a intensive unit care.

2.2     Theoretical Framework
    This paper uses as main theoretical background the idea of cumulative formation of skills, ex-
pressed in works such as Cunha and Heckman (2007) and Todd and Wolpin (2003, 2007). The
literature on skills and human capital formation has departed from the idea of innate and immutable
skills that children are born with and now considers skill formation as a life cycle process that starts
in the womb and continues throughout childhood and adolescence. Childhood is not considered to
be a one-stage period in which investments are made, but as a multi-stage period that allows for
four scales made up total scores. The first two scales can also be grouped to form the externalizing subcomponent,
whereas emotional problems and peer relations can be grouped to form the internalizing subcomponent. Each scale
has five questions and scores are computed by adding answers. Here, we normalize total and subcomponents scores to
have mean zero and standard deviation 1, with positive values meaning better mental health. This questionnaire was
applied when children were 11 years old, both to them directly and to their mothers. For more details, see Goodman
et al. (2010)

self-productivity in the process of forming skills, that is, previously accumulated skills foster the
formation of new skills. Unlike previous works on economics that used a scalar to summarizes peo-
ple’s abilities, now the literature highlights the importance of multiple skills in many life outcomes,
particularly cognitive and non-cognitive skills and health (Cunha et al., 2006; Glewwe and Miguel,
2008; Currie and Almond, 2011). These different skills may also help in the development of other
skills, in what is called dynamic complementarities. For instance, children with less non-cognitive
skills may find it more difficult to focus in classroom and thus acquire less cognitive skills (Cunha
et al., 2006; Cunha and Heckman, 2007).
    Next, we follow closely Cunha and Heckman (2007) in developing a simple model that guides our
empirical analysis and interpretation of results. We assume households consist of an adult parent
and her children. Childhood lasts for T periods, during which parents must choose the level of
investment to be made in their children. After T periods of childhood, they become adults with
skills h = g(θT ), that they sell in the labor market, and they also give birth to children of their
own. At conception, children endow a vector of k skills θ0 = (θ0,1 , θ0,2 , . . . , θ0,k ), which develops in
the womb to form a vector of skills at birth, θ1 = (θ1,1 , θ1,2 , . . . , θ1,k ). This development process
already depends on parental investments (such as prenatal care or smoking during pregnancy) and
random shocks that may affect children in uterus (such as placenta positioning or some maternal
physiological condition)11 . In the following stages, parents continue to invest in their children to
form skills, always building up on previous skills. This process can be formalized as follows:

                                              θk,t+1 = ft (θt , It , h, Xt , ηk,t )                              (1)

That is, skill k in period t + 1 depends on the vector of skills in period t, θt , on parental investments
at time t, It , parental skills, h, and other family and child characteristics Xt , together with random
shocks ηk,t that are independent across skills and periods. Parental investments account for both
monetary and time investments. Parental skills include human capital that may increase the produc-
tivity of investments (e.g. parents with more schooling may be more able to help their children with
homework). With respect to other children and family characteristics, we are particularly interested
in a child’s race, although other characteristics such as gender and presence of both parents may
also be relevant. The relationship between these inputs and skills in the next periods is mediated
by a technology of skill formation, ft , which is time-variant. Cunha and Heckman (2007) discuss
conditions on this production function so that empirical findings such as dynamic complementar-
ity, self-productivity, and critical and sensitive periods may arise. Particularly, a CES production
function is able to capture all of these characteristics under certain values for its parameters.
    We can write the process of formation for skills at period t + 1 recursively as:
                                                                               t
                     θk,t+1 = mt (h, θ0 , I0 , . . . , It , X0 , . . . , Xt , ηk,0 ), for t = 0, 1, . . . , T.   (2)

that is, skills k at period t + 1 depends on the initial vector of skills, parental skills, and the whole
history of investments (I0 , . . . , It ), family and child characteristics (X0 , . . . , Xt ), and independent
                         t
shocks across time (ηk,0    = (ηk,0 , . . . , ηk,t )) that affect skill accumulation. At period T, this set of
skills is converted into a stock of human capital h = g(θT ).
    Cunha and Heckman (2007) illustrate how investments by optimizing parents can vary under
different circumstances. For this, they develop a simple over-lapping generations model with four
periods. Upon reaching adulthood, parents receive a bequest b and adult human capital h, which
they offer inelastically in the labor market for wage w. They also give birth to a children with initial
skill levels θ1 . Parents must then decide how much to consume in periods 1 and 2 (c1 and c2 ), how
much to invest in their children (I1 and I2 ) and how much to leave as bequest to them (b0 ). Assuming
  11
    Cunha and Heckman (2007) are open to the possibility of including in uterus investments in their model, although
they do not do so explicitly.

Parents are altruistic towards their children and want to maximize their welfare. Assuming a discount
factor β, parental altruism δ, and utility function u(.), we can formulate parents’ recursive problem
as:
                        V (h, b, θ1 ) = max{u(c1 ) + βu(c2 ) + β 2 δE[V (h0 , b0 , θ10 )]}         (4)
where h0 , b0 and θ10 represent their children’s adult skills, bequest, and grandchild’s initial vector of
skills.
    By maximizing equation (4) subject to budget (3) and technology (2), Cunha and Heckman
(2007) are able to derive optimal ratios of early to late investment. They point out three market
imperfections that may affect this ratio of investments and therefore children’s accumulation of skills.
The first is that children cannot choose the optimal level of parental skills, h, that match their initial
endowment of skills, θ1 . Children of parents with low levels of education, for instance, would acquire
less skills than children with similar levels of initial skills, but with highly educated parents. This
market imperfection is present even under unconstrained borrowing. Second, parents cannot leave
negative bequests, that is, they cannot borrow against their children’s future income, which may
lead to suboptimal investment in poorer families. Third, under incomplete markets, parents may
be unable to borrow against their own future incomes, what could inhibit adequate investments in
the first periods, thus hindering later development due to dynamic complementarity. These market
failures help explain why children born in poor families under-invest in education. As we have
seem in our descriptive analysis, black children are born in less advantaged environments, what can
explain their worse results in schooling and other skills compared to their white counterparts.
    To empirically test to what extent black-white gaps in birth weight, socioecomotional skills, or
years of schooling are due to differences in family background we estimate simple versions of equation
(1). We follow Todd and Wolpin (2003, 2007) and Cunha and Heckman (2008) in proposing a linear
specification for this equation. We define six periods in our setting, period 0, relative to pregnancy,
period 1, from perinatal to 10 years, period 2, between 11 and 14 years, period 3, between 15 and
17 years, period 4, between 18 and 21 years, and period 5, from 22 years on. For period one, we
estimate the following equation:

                                θ1,i = α0 + δ0 Di + β0 I0,i + γ0 X0,i + ε0,i                          (5)

where θ1 represent some health outcome at birth, particularly birth weight, α0 is a constant, Di is
an indicator for race, such that Di = 1[Race = Non-white] and δ0 is the estimated black-white gap
in this skill. In uterus parental investments, I0,i , is a vector that includes the number of prenatal
appointments, an indicator variable for maternal smoking during pregnancy, an indicator variable
for mother working during pregnancy, and gestational weight gain. Finally, we add many family
and individual controls: indicator for baby being male, maternal BMI before pregnancy, maternal
height, whether a child born before that pregnancy was low birth weight or premature, the number of
previous births (parity), dummies for whether the mother was diagnosed with diabetes, high pressure,
urinary infection, anemia, or had an abortion threat. Vector X0,i also includes SES variables: log of
per capita family income, mother’s schooling, maternal age, and a dummy for living with partner.
We assume the error term ε1,i is independent and identically distributed. Theoretically, this error
term includes both an initial endowment of skills, θ0,i , as well as a random shock η1,i . However, we
cannot distinguish these objects in our empirical setting.
    The inclusion of these controls are motivated by the literature, particularly Kramer (1987). He
reviews the literature on determinants of birth weight and argue that there are well-established
causal impacts on intrauterine growth that include infant sex and race, maternal height and weight,

                                                     8
gestational weight gain, cigarette smoking, parity, previous cases of low birth weight, episodic illness
and other conditions12 . Socioeconomic status seem to only play a role as indirect factor, having no
causal impact on birth weight alone. However, we include it due to its correlation with our racial
dummy. Similar factors are also associated with gestational duration.
   After investigating birth outcomes we turn to SDQ scores at 11 years and, most importantly,
years of schooling across age. For age 11 we estimate the following functions:

                         k      k      k
                        θ2,i = α1,i + δ1,i                  k
                                           Di + β1k I0,i + γ1,1         k
                                                                X1,i + γ1,0 X0,i + θ1,i + εk1,i                   (6)
where k correspond to SDQ scores or years of schooling. Apart from the variables already included
in the first regression (D, I0 , X0 ) we also include: i) a measure of health at birth θ1,i , generally birth
weight; ii) family characteristics in period 1, X1,i , which include: log of per capita family income,
number of children born up to that period13 , a dummy variable for mothers living with a partner,
and mother’s SRQ-20. Although we do not include variables for investments in the first period,
the covariates included act as inputs in the demand equations for investments and help dealing
with potential omitted-variable bias, what Todd and Wolpin (2007) call hybrid specifications of the
production function. The inclusion of in uterus investments and birth weight, together with other
covariates related to early health, is motivated by recent developments that support the fetal origins
hypothesis (Currie and Moretti, 2007; Case and Paxson, 2010; Currie, 2011; Currie and Almond,
2011; Almond and Currie, 2011). This literature has shown that early life condition, measured
through indicator of health at birth such as birth weight, are related to outcomes later in life,
including schooling and performance in test scores.
    For ages 15, 18, and 22 (periods 3, 4, and 5) we also include previous schooling and SDQ score at
11 years as independent variables, and for ages 18 and 22 we include log of per capita family income
at 18 years old. The introduction of these lagged dependent variables aims at reducing problems of
omitted-variable bias due to lack of data on lagged inputs (Todd and Wolpin, 2003).


3      Main Results
    This section presents the main results regarding racial gaps in the outcomes of interest based on
the empirical analysis discussed in the previous section. We first present and discuss the finds related
to birth outcomes, assessing to what degree black and white children differ at the moment they
are born and whether such differences can be explained by differences in family characteristics and
investments during pregnancy. Next, we analyze differences in years of schooling and socioemotional
skills at age 11. We also analyze the evolution of the racial gap in years of schooling from childhood
up to early adulthood.

3.1     Differences at birth
    Table 3 displays regressions of birth weight on several variables. Birth weight is normalized to
have mean zero and standard deviation (SD) one across the whole sample (one standard deviation is
approximately 550 grams). We use all available information and restrict estimation to the sample of
children that are singleton and not premature. For this variable there is significant raw gap between
white and non-white children to be around 0.15 SD. We next introduce sequentially some sets of
variables on the regression. Column (1) includes socioeconomic status of families, represented by log
  12
     Rahmati et al. (2017) and Figueiredo et al. (2018) find evidence that maternal anemia is related to infant low
birth weight; gestational diabetes is associated with higher levels of insulin in the blood and thus with higher birth
weight (Silverman et al., 1991); high pressure (in the form of preeclampsia) may be related to lower birth weight
(Ødegård et al., 2000); and urinary infection may be causally related with birth weight in developing countries,
although evidence is not sufficient (Kramer, 1987).

     Thus including children born before the interviewed child was born.

family income per capita, mother’s schooling and age and whether the mother lived with a partner
(not necessarily the child’s dad). We observe a considerable reduction by 1/3 in the racial gap.
Next, in column (2) we introduce variables related to in uterus investments (number of prenatal
visits, whether the mother smoked during pregnancy, whether she worked during pregnancy, and the
gestational weight gain) and other controls that the medical literature have related as determinants
of birth weight, as previously discussed. We notice that with the addition of such variables, the
covariates representing families’ socioeconomic status cease to be significant. This is line with the
medical literature that find no effect of socioeconomic variables once the relevant obstetric factors
are controlled for (Kramer, 1987). In particular, the results also show that the number of prenatal
appointments and smoking during pregnancy are particularly relevant in determining birth weight.
An increase of one SD in the number of prenatal appointments (half visit) is related with an increase
of 0.05 SD in birth weight, whereas smoking during pregnancy considerably reduces a baby’s birth
weight in nearly a quarter of SD. Nonetheless, we still find significant racial differences in birth
weight. The size of the gap is reduced by more than 50%, to 0.07 SD, around 40 grams. As a matter
of comparison, Morisaki et al. (2017) find a black-white gap in birth weight of nearly 150 grams in
the United States using similar controls.

Birth weight and length at birth are normalized to have mean zero and standard deviation one (mean ≈ 3150 grams
and SD ≈ 550 grams for birth weight and mean ≈ 48.7cm and SD ≈ 2.4 for length)). Low Birth Weight (< 2500
grams) and Premature (< 37 weeks) are dummies. For Premature, we include only singletons, and for the remain-
ing dependent variables we also exclude premature babies. Variables with “(Std)” are also normalized to have mean
zero and standard deviation one. Other Socioeconomic variables include mother’s age and whether partner lives in
the household. Other investments in pregnancy include: Whether mother worked during pregnancy and gestational
weight gain. Obstetric factor include: mother’s BMI and height prior pregnancy, previous cases of low birth weight
and prematurity, infant’s gender, parity and dummies for the occurrence of diabetes, high pressure, urinary infections,
anemia and risk of abortion during pregnancy. Robust standard errors in parenthesis.

of being premature14 (< 37 weeks). The results for birth weight are again found for length at birth,
but we do not find any racial differences in the chances of being low birth weight of being premature.
Some of these finding are reported in the literature while other diverge. For instance, Kramer (1987)
finds no evidence of racial differences in the chances of preterm births. However, there is evidence
of higher prevalence of low birth weights in African-Americans in the United States compared to
White Americans (David and Collins Jr, 1997). Among the hypothesis raised to explain these gaps
in outcomes are life-course perspectives that highlight the importance of factors such as maternal
birth weight, exposure to stress, and different environments. Since black mothers were born with
lower birth weights, are more exposed to stress (due to racism, for instance), and live in poorer
neighborhood, this could end up affecting the health of their babies (Lu and Halfon, 2003; Collins Jr
and David, 2009). However, the reason why this is not reflect into prematurity or LBW is not clear.

3.2       Racial differences in schooling and socioemotional skills
    In this section we discuss differences in schooling and socioemotional skills at age 11. Table 4
displays the results of regressing years of schooling at 11 years old on a series of covariates. Column
1 display the raw gap of nearly 0.4 SD, which corresponds to almost half an year of schooling, a
quite substantial difference given a mean of less than 4 years. Next, we regress education at 11 years
on standardized birth weight. Higher birth weights are correlated with higher levels of schooling,
but it only slightly reduces racial differences in education. In column 3 we add differences in mother
SRQ-20, a measure of psychological health that has not yet been studied as a possible source of racial
inequalities in human capital. An increase of one standard deviation in the score in this measure
(nearly 4 points in a scale that ranges from 0 to 20) is related with 0.17 SD less years of schooling,
and a reduction in the racial gap of around 10%. Column 4 display the results when socioeconomic
status at 11 years are introduced, which are highly correlated with race and psychological health. As
expected, there is a considerable decreases in the coefficient of the non-white indicator, together with
a significant drop in the mother’s SRQ-20 measure. Nonetheless, both coefficients remain significant.
    Finally, we introduce variables related to mother behavior during pregnancy, SES at birth, and
obstetric factors. These variables further reduce the racial gap indicator, and magnitude of the
coefficients on birth weight and mother’s SRQ-20. Also, the number of prenatal appointments and
whether or not the mother smoked during pregnancy remain significantly correlated with education
at 11 years, meaning that in uterus investment may have long-lasting effects on schooling. Due
to lack of space, we do not display the estimated coefficients for the remaining variables here, but
the results confirm the relation between years of schooling and other socioeconomic variables, such
as mother’s education, number of children, and per capita family income. In particular, families’
income both at the moment of birth and at 11 years are significantly correlated with educational
achievement. The effects are large, with an increase of 1% in the per capita family income at birth
related with an increase of 0.08 SD in years of schooling, and 0.15 SD when we consider family
income at 11 years.
    Table 5 reproduces the same estimations for the standardized total score in the SDQ, with its
4 main components aggregated (that is, excluding pro-social behavior), measured using children’s
answer. We interpret this measure as a proxy for socioemotional skills. Column 1 displays the
raw gap in the score, of 1/4 of a standard deviation. At column 2 we observe that birth weight
is barely correlated with the dependent variable. Moreover, its inclusion almost no affect on the
racial gap. Including mother’s SRQ-20 alters slightly the coefficient of the racial dummy, and it
has a considerable correlation with SDQ score. Column 4 further adds SES at 11 years, which
considerably reduces racial inequalities in the dependent variable, even though it is not able to
completely close it. In column 5 covariates measured at birth were included, further reducing the
gap. The coefficient of smoking during pregnancy is significant and sizable, whereas the number of
 14
      In this case, we include in the regression singletons, but do not exclude premature babies.

prenatal visit is not. Although we do not show the estimated coefficients for all variables, we find
that per capita family income is not correlated with SDQ scores, even though other socioeconomic
indicators such as number of children, presence of a partner at the household, and mother’s age and
education are all significantly correlated with coefficients in the expected direction.

3.3    The evolution of the racial in schooling from 15 to 22 years old
    Based on the theoretical framework previously described, we now address the dynamics of racial
gaps in years schooling at ages 15, 18, and 22 years old. To estimate the conditional gap on these
outcomes, we condition the regression on previous educational achievement and SDQ total scores at
age 11. Table 6 shows the results. At age 15, black children are lagging behind nearly 0.9 year of
schooling, or half SD (one SD ≈ 1.75 years of schooling). Nonetheless, when we control for previous
schooling and SDQ score the racial gap is reduced considerably to 0.18 SD. Further controlling for
family socioeconomic status, mother SRQ-20 by the time children were 11 years old, and controls
from a child’s birth reduces marginally the size of the racial gap. Birth weight and maternal SRQ-20
are not significant once we control for all other variables, meaning that their effects are possibly
restricted to the first years of schooling. However, number of prenatal appointments and smoking
during pregnancy seem to have lasting effects.
    The results for years of schooling at ages 18 and 22 are distinct. First, controlling for previous
schooling and SDQ total score reduces the racial gap significantly, to nearly 1/10 of its original size
in the case of education at 18 years. When we include other variables related to SES at various
ages and factors that affect birth weights the racial gap ceases to be significant at both ages. Hence,

we conclude that although the normalized unconditional gap is somewhat stable across childhood
and early adulthood, the conditional gap is determined up to adolescence. This is in line with finds
by Cameron and Heckman (2001) showing that the racial gap in college attendance is determined
by early home environment and parental background rather than by financial constraints when
children choose to go or not to college. Finally, in uterus investments such as number of prenatal
appointments and smoking in pregnancy, as well as birth weight, are not significantly related with
schooling at age 18, although it is for schooling at age 22. This may be a sign of long lasting effects of
these factors, although the reason why the only manifest at 22 years but not 18 is not clear. Another
possibility is that early home environments and cognitive skills are more important to educational

coefficients on birth weights and in uterus investments, since these variables are correlated with
both inputs, corroborating again the finds of Cameron and Heckman (2001).


4     Heterogeneity Checks
4.1    Differences in dynamics by family socioeconomic status
    Here, we investigate whether the racial gap in years of schooling has different dynamics within
different socioeconomic groups. We consider two cutoffs for SES: one based on real family income
at the time children were born and another based on maternal schooling by the time of delivery.
Families are split in two halves of the distribution of family per capita income at the median, whereas
mothers are split in three educational groups: up to 7th grade (incomplete primary school), between
8th and 11th grade (complete primary but incomplete secondary school), and those with at least

complete high school. Table 7 summarizes some information concerning these socioeconomic groups
regarding average family income per capita, mother’s schooling, the sample size of white and non-
white children, and racial gaps in family income per capita and maternal schooling. As we move up
in the socioeconomic latter, the number of non-white children decreases, an expect fact given Brazil’s
racial inequality. Moreover, we notice that the differences between the average white and non-white
family is larger among privileged subgroups of the population. For instance, whereas the racial gap
in family income per capita is only 15 Brazilian Reals within the bottom half of the distribution and
differences in maternal education are only 0.7 years of schooling, in the top half these differences are
respectively almost 300 Brazilian Reals and 1.8 years of schooling.

gaps are larger within the richer group, although they are always quite similar. We observe that the
conditional racial gap in only significantly different from zero at age 22 for the richer group, around
0.09 SD, whereas the point estimate for the poorer group is even positive, although not significant.
This suggests that black children from more advantaged background may face additional difficulties
in getting into college.

All dependent variables are standardized to have mean zero and variance one. Odd columns refer to unconditional
gaps, whereas even columns refer to conditional ones. Unconditional gaps include as dependent variable only dummies
for month of birth and month of interview (the latter only for schooling at 11 years old). Conditional gaps include all
controls specified for models described in Tables 4 and 6.

    In panel (b), we evaluate the heterogeneity in racial gaps based on mother’s schooling and reach
similar conclusions. In the first period, when children are 11 years old, the unconditional racial gap
in larger among lower socioeconomic groups, and there are no significant differences among children
of mother with at least complete high school. The conditional gap favors white children among the
two lower strata, but favors black children within the highest. Hence, at least in the first period,
the behavior of the racial gap across subgroups seems quite different from that of cutoff based on
income, with more smaller gaps within more privileged groups. When children are 15 years old, the
results for all three groups are quite similar, with both unconditional and conditional gaps favoring
white children. Finally, the conditional racial gap at age 18 and 22 is only significant among children
born in the highest socioeconomic group. These results again suggest that among the highest social
groups, black children may struggle to continue their studies into higher levels of schooling, even
though they seemed to benefit from a better background in the first period.

                                                          15
    Why is the conditional racial gap in schooling only significant for the groups of higher socioe-
conomic status? A possible explanation is that children born in lower SES families simply cannot
afford continuing their studies after 18 years old or after they complete high school. Hence, if only
the richest children can keep studying after a certain age, and if mechanisms that prevent black
students to perform as well as their white counterparts still exist during early adulthood, then it is
expected that racial inequalities in schooling grow only among those children.

4.2    Gender
    There is some evidence that differences in outcomes between black and white children can be dis-
tinct between genders. For instance, Chetty et al. (2018) find that the racial gap in intergenerational
mobility in the United States is driven mainly by differences between black and white males, with
no racial differences among females. In Brazil, Rangel (2015) and Marteleto and Dondero (2016)
find that different rates of school enrollment between siblings of distinct skin complexion is stronger
for boys. Therefore, we investigate the possibility that the black-white gap in schooling has distinct
dynamics between boys and girls.
    Table 9 displays the estimated black-white gap in schooling across years for males and females.
The normalized unconditional racial gap behaves differently between boys and girls. For boys, it
grows considerably fast between 11 and 15 years old, jumping from 0.47 SD to 0.64 SD. After that,
the gap decreases at 18 and 22 years old, when it equals the level when children were 11 years old.
For girls, however, is starts at a much lower level of 0.31 SD, then increasing to 0.42 at age 15. At
18 years old, the normalized unconditional gap reaches 0.45 and settles at this value. Although the
trend is much different than that observed among boys, both groups end up with similar levels of
racial inequality. When we test the equality of the racial gap among these two groups, we confirm
that they are statistically distinct at 11 and 15 years old, but not after 18 years.

     Regarding the conditional gap, we again observe differences between gender. First, the condi-
tional racial gap at 11 years is only significantly different from zero among boys, while at 15 years
it is different for both groups, but smaller among girls. At 18 and 22 years, there are no conditional
racial gaps for neither of these groups.

    Therefore, it is not possible to characterize the black-white gap in schooling as being a phe-
nomenon exclusive to one gender, since within both groups black individuals lag behind their peers.
Nonetheless, the dynamics seem to be quite different for black boys and girls. For the first group,
the first years seem to be the biggest challenge, as the gap increases substantially up to 15 years
old. For girls, the gap between black and white students is much smaller, and contrary to boys, we
observe a considerable increase in the unconditional black-white gap from 18 to 22 years old. Future
research should investigate deeply the reasons behind these distinctive patterns across gender.


5    Summary and Policy Discussion
    The degree to which racial inequalities in labor markets or human capital are due to “objective”
factors or the results of racial discrimination has been an open topic in economics and other social
sciences for decades. In Brazil, the idea of “racial democracy” has been challenged in academia and
public discourse in the last decades, and some evidence has pointed out to the existence of racial
inequalities in labor market and human capital accumulation that cannot be fully explained by
observable variables. Here, we shed some light on the dynamics of human capital accumulation from
birth up to early childhood using a unique dataset that allow us to observe family characteristics
during pregnancy and childhood, as well as birth outcomes and schooling achievement from 11 to 22
years old. We find evidence that black children are lighter and smaller when they are born, but this
does not reflects in prematurity or chances of being low birth weight. We also report unexplained
differences between black and white children at age 11 both in years of schooling and SDQ total
scores. Although there exists a significant relationship between birth weight and years of schooling,
its size is too small when compared to socioeconomic status and can explain only a small difference
in racial differences in schooling. However, in uterus investments and maternal mental health are
other mechanisms that affect racial gap and had received little attention in the past. Future research
should investigate this channels further.
    We document increasing gaps in years of schooling between black and white children that are
already quite substantial at age 11, at around half an year, and grow to surpass one years of education
in early adulthood. However, the normalized unconditional racial gap in somewhat stable across
years, being of 0.4 SD at age 11, reaching a peak of 0.5 SD at 15, and then decreasing to 0.43
SD at 22 years old. When we include controls for previous education and other covariates in the
regressions, the conditional racial gaps in years of schooling cease to be significant after 15 years
old. This finding supports the idea that racial inequalities arise early in life and that public policy
should focus its attention in providing adequate support for disadvantaged children even before they
start school.
    Finally, there seems to be some differences in the dynamics of the racial gap according to socioe-
conomic status and gender. Conditional racial gaps in years of schooling are significant at ages 18
and 22 for children of mothers with completed high school and in the top half of the income distri-
bution, contrary to what happen in the whole sample or among families of lower SES. These results
may be interpreted as a cautionary warning with respect to the stability of the racial gap after age
15, as is the case for the whole sample, since black children with better background - precisely the
ones more likely to carry on their studies past high school - may still face difficulties upon entering
college. Hence, policies such as affirmative action in universities may be an important instrument in
fighting racial inequalities in education. Regarding differences between between boys and girls, we
find that the racial gap grows much faster at a young age for boys, while it grows at a steady pace
for girls. Conditional racial gaps among girls are only significant at age 15, whereas for boys it is
significant both at 11 and 15 years. The reasons behind this distinct pattern across gender in racial
gaps should be further investigated in future research.
