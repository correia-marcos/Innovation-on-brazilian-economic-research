       Resumo. Este trabalho explora o papel da oportunidade tecnológica e a cumulatividade na
evolução dos padrões de especialização tecnológica (PET) dos países em desenvolvimento. A análise
empírica utiliza dados de patentes entre 1980 e 2010 para 9 países latino-americanos e asiáticos. O
trabalho mostra que os novos paradigmas tecno-económicos dos anos oitenta e a internacionalização
mundial dos noventa aceleraram o processo de catching up de ambos os grupos de países, mas com
algumas diferenças entre América Latina e Ásia. Todos os países aumentaram sua parcela tecnológica
no mundo, diversificaram suas bases tecnológicas e reduziram seus níveis de especialização. Todavia,
os países asiáticos atingiram um melhor desempenho e criaram competência e capacitações em
tecnologias relacionadas com os novos paradigmas tecno-económicos. Não há evidencia de que o
aproveitamento de janelas de oportunidade dependa de corretas ou incorretas especializações iniciais.
PET podem reverter com incentivos apropriados e suscetíveis de mudanças ao longo de processos de
catching up.
        Abstract. This paper explores the role of technological opportunity and cumulativeness in the
evolution of technological specialization patterns (TSP) in developing countries. Empirical analyses
uses patent data between 1980 and 2010 of 9 Asian and Latin American countries. The paper shows
that the new techno-economic paradigms of the eighties and the world internationalization from the
nineties accelerated the catching up process in both groups of countries, but with some differences
between Latin American and Asian. All countries increased their technology share, diversified their
technological bases and reduced their levels of specialization. However, the Asian countries achieved
a higher performance and created competences and capabilities in the technologies related to the new
techno-economic paradigms. There is no evidence that taking the advantages from open windows of
opportunity depends on correct or incorrect initial specializations. TSP are reversible with the
appropriate incentives and are suitable to change along any catching up process.

       1. Introduction.


        The liberalization processes from the nineties resulted in deep changes in the world economy.
One of them concerns to the national technological specialization patterns (TSP). Recent studies
pointed out the evolution of national TSP responds to three factors (Urraca-Ruiz 2013a): the evolution
of technological regimes, the induced allocation of technological resources by policies and institutional
incentives and the structural change. This paper calls the attention to the first one. From technological
regimes, the main factors affecting TSP are the technological cumulativeness and technological
opportunity. Theory deals with technological cumulativeness as path dependent and therefore, a cause
of stability or persistence of TSP. In this sense, empirical analyses on TSP should verify: (1) a difficulty
to create specialization in technical fields where there are no previous absorptive capacity, especially
if there are barriers to diffusion; (2) an easiness to increase previous specializations; and (3) low
mobility levels. Empirical evidence in the eighties revealed that industrialized countries perform
diversified TSP, while small and developing countries became more specialized in their technological
profiles (Archibugi and Pianta 1992, 1994). Nevertheless, more recent empirical evidence showed that
persistency is a phenomenon more associated to leading countries while mobility across technical
fields trends to be higher and asymmetric in developing countries (Stolpe 1995; Laursen 2000;
Mancusi 2001; Urraca-Ruiz, 2013a). Evidence showed that it was difficult to increase specialization
in technical fields with no previous specialization but quite easy to move towards technical fields
related to previous specializations. Furthermore, there was no evidence of persistence at high levels of
specialization. On the contrary, high levels of specialization reverted to lower ones, being quicker and
more drastic in smaller countries (Mancusi 2001; Roper and Hewitt-Dundas, 2008).
        Literature identify two determinants for mobility: the technological opportunity (TO) and
structural change. Technological opportunity represent new open "windows of opportunity" from
achieved technological capacities given the new possibilities that technological paradigms offer. Open
markets and competition incentive to take advantages from the new technological possibilities, which
stimulate the internal innovation efforts. The reallocation of productive and technological resources in
these terms are related to structural change and the industrial transformation. However, earlier
empirical works on TSP evolution disregard the effect of economic integration and technological
opportunity on innovative resources allocation, even when empirical analysis were performed on
countries in processes of transition towards more integrated economic spaces.
       Evolution of TSP acquire some specificities in developing countries. In first place, empirical
evidence revealed that while industrialized countries distributed their innovative activities among a
wider set of technologies, developing countries used to specialize in low-opportunity technologies (far
from the technological frontier). This kind of specialization would have a perverse effect and constraint
the long-term technological development (Archibugi and Pianta, 1994; Mancusi 2001; Montobbio and
Rampa 2005). In second place, to find technologies in developing countries is a costly and hard process
[even that asymmetric across technologies] at least for two reasons (Lall, 2000). First, because it is
necessary to develop new capabilities -skills and tacit knowledge- to use and apply efficiently imported
technologies; and second, because of the costs of coordination to create internal capabilities are high
and asymmetric. As technological specialization reveals capabilities, TSP evolution depends more on
the national ability to create new capabilities on new competences than to reproduce the old ones.
Therefore, there are good reasons to think that in mobility and turbulence will be a major characteristic
of countries along a process of building of competences.
         This paper looks for empirical evidence about the determinants of the TSP evolution for
developing countries -Asian and Latin American-. More concretely, the paper focus on the role played
by technological opportunity for turbulence and cumulativeness for stability of TSP patters. There are
two motivations in the comparison between Asia and Latin America. Both groups went through
economic integration processes with the world, which represented important structural changes int
their economies (Shafaeddin, 2005). Nonetheless, they followed very different productive and
commercial patterns of specialization. As Asian followed a specialization pattern oriented to the
production and exports of labor-intensive and knowledge-intensive products, Latin American followed
a specialization pattern based on its principal national endowments: natural resources (Alcorta and
Peres, 1998; Urraca-Ruiz, 2013b). The Asian success by catching up contrasts with the Latin America
'failure' characterized by its inability to develop strategic and pervasive technologies from its own
competitive advantages.
        The main motivation of this work is to contribute with empirical evidence about the
specificities of the TSP evolution in developing countries in the following aspects. Firstly, by
answering if it really exists some initial favorable TSP that allows future technological development
better than any other does. Secondly by discussing if the Latin American specialization pattern did
constrain its catching up process in two senses. First, because it did not allow taking advantages of
technological opportunities associated to its specific pattern of specialization. Second, because the
Latin American TSP restricted the change a more diversified one, confirming a certain irreversibility
of technical change.


       2. Theoretical framework.
        Technology is the result of continuous knowledge production processes. From an evolutionary
point of view, knowledge production processes involve, at the firm level, different kinds of learning
activities to create and accumulate new knowledge (capabilities) in technological competences. At
country level, national technological structures are the aggregation of technological competences
[distributed by technical field] embodied in individuals, firms and institutions. Going along with
productive structure, a technological structure is the distribution of technological capabilities built
from specific allocations of technological resources across fields of technological knowledge
(Meliciani 2002; Brusoni and Geuna 2003). A pattern of technological specialization (TSP) expresses
the technological structure of a country in relative terms, this is, in comparison to another country or a
group-of-countries of reference.
        The literature points out that three are the determinants of TSP evolution: the properties of
technological regimes associated to the initial specializations, the institutional incentives to the
allocation of technological resources and structural change (Urraca-Ruiz, 2013a). From technological
regimes, cumulativeness has an ambiguous effect on the TSP evolution. By one hand, cumulativeness
represents the ‘continuity’ of technical change. Given that each technology has specific bases of
knowledge, the rate and direction of technical change will depend on how countries learn [acquire and
accumulate new knowledge from previous efforts] and develop absorptive capacity (Cohen and
Levinthal 1990; Malerba 1992; Malerba et al. 1997; Malerba and Montobbio 2000). At the firm level,
the technological accumulation of competencies combined to market forces drives to persistence of
innovative activities, and as a consequence, persistence of the leading technologies and persistence of
the leading firms. As successful innovation generates quasi-rents that funds future R&D, innovating
in period t increases the probability to innovate also in t+1 (Malerba et al, 1997). The evolution of
national TSP would represent the aggregated effect of persistence at the firm level, but also would
include the path dependent character of the social process of learning concerning all organizations
(universities, public research centers, government agencies, etc.). The result of persistence is the
stability of TSP over time (Brusoni and Geuna 2003) in two senses. One, as the countries’ ability to
remain specialized in the same technical fields. And two, as the inability to move on from
despecialization to the creation of growing technological capabilities in new technological
competences. In this sense, cumulativeness introduces some level of irreversibility on the TSP
evolution.
        However, by the other hand, cumulativeness can also be associated to mobility, especially in
developing countries, because it is closely related to the catching-up processes. The cumulative
character of knowledge by learning processes to assimilation, adaptation and capacitation makes TSP
evolution not just the result of a “unique historical process”, but the result of combining specific
relative factor endowments with the accumulation of national absorptive capacities (Stolpe 1995).
Consequently, the evolution of TSP express the path of cumulativeness from leading advantages
through absorption capacity and catching-up. If TSP follows a path from previous specializations, the
result will be stability. Nonetheless, if countries are able to create new capabilities from the old ones,
the result will be mobility and turbulence. Both phenomena are not excluding and can occur
simultaneously, especially along economic integration processes when incentives to the allocation of
resources changes and some structural change is expected.
        Empirical evidence about the role of cumulativeness on stability confirms the theoretical
previsions only partially. On one hand, greater levels of persistence are more common in large and
industrialized countries, where leading technologies and firms trend to remain, but not necessarily in
developing countries where new players can enter into the scene. In addition, mobility observed in
developing countries are mostly associated to their process to build new technological capabilities,
which no necessarily come from cumulated ones. On the other hand, persistence uses to be a
phenomenon more related to despecialization than to specialization, being despecialization stability
the main component of TSP stability (Mancusi 2001, 2003; Urraca-Ruiz, 2013a). In fact, mobility is
usually high and asymmetric across technical fields, which means that it is more difficult to increase
specialization in technological fields where there is a previous disadvantage but it seems to be easier
to move from one specializations to another, transforming strong initial specializations into growing
levels of diversification (Mancusi 2001). Fourth,
        In relation to the role of technological opportunity on TSP there are two alternative hypotheses.
On one hand, the direction of TSP mobility depends on initial ‘correct’ or ‘wrong’ specialization.
Innovation process is cumulative and knowledge becomes more complex in the frontier. In order to
achieve technological leadership, countries should previously develop technological competences on
basic scientific and generic knowledge. Specialization in these type of competences yield advantages
for technological progress due to their synergies with other technologies and the wider range for
application in other activities [pervasiveness], and because they shorten learning and innovation
processes [dynamism] (Huang and Miozzo 2004; Meliciani 2002; Montobbio and Rampa 2005).
Specialization in ‘inferior’ technical fields (lower opportunity) represent a constraint for developing
countries unless they introduce proper institutional frameworks and public policies to diversify the
technical base creating absorptive capacity to make possible the catching-up (Vertova, 2001;
Jungmittag, 2004). In this sense, ‘incorrect’ specialization can be associated with technological
structures at initial stages of technological development.
         On the other hand, leading technologies and technological frontier are changing along with the
evolution of technological paradigms. As technological paradigms evolve, initial leading technologies
can mature while new ones emerge by taking the advantages and opportunities that new paradigms
offer. This was the case of biotechnologies on agriculture and food or new materials on surfaces and
semiconductors. Thus, what was “incorrect” specialization in one period may cease to be in the next
one. The changing nature of technological opportunity across technologies explains why despite initial
unfavorable specialization, some countries register high technological dynamism as long as some
efforts are carried out (Laursen 1999; Meliciani 2002). In addition, the techno-economic paradigms
affect the whole range of technological systems and new micro-paradigms emerge and develop. In the
initial stages, when general knowledge is more relevant than specific knowledge, technological gaps
as barriers to entry are low, temporary “windows of opportunity” are open, and developing countries
that possess the relevant knowledge and techniques can catch up, even surpassing previous leaders
(Perez and Soete, 1988:477). In this scenario, catching up is not only a question of relative speed, but
also involves running in a new direction as an early entrant in a new technology system. Therefore,
developing countries can experience mobility of this nature and TSP will be changing and unstable;
and technology leaps can be observed. Afterwards, continuous innovation efforts, accumulation of
knowledge and leadership in the markets will stabilize the new TSP until a new techno-economic
paradigm emerges.


       3. Patent Database.
       The empirical analysis works on patent applications in the European Patent Office by six Asian
countries (China, India, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong-Kong) and three Latin-American
countries (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico) between 1980 and 2010. EPO database represents the best
source of information to international comparisons for several reasons. Firstly, because a simple patent
is extensible to all Munich Convention member countries, which eliminates country bias of the
domestic effect [like, UPSTO does]. Secondly, fee applications are relatively higher, which excludes
from the database patents of low industrial value. Thirdly, EPO publishes grants and deposits of patents
eighteen months after the application (by mean), while other bases are more delayed [for example,
UPSTO only publishes after two years (by mean)] (Grupp and Schomach, 1999; Le Bas and Sierra,
2002; van Zeebroeck et al., 2006).
        Patents are largely used to analyze technological competences at national and firm level
because they represent results of formal or informal innovation efforts and provide detailed data in a
regular and long time series grouped by firm, country, geographic location or technical field (Patel and
Pavitt 1991). Nonetheless, there are also some limitations of patent data as a source of information to
express national TSP. First, patents reveal distributions of competences in terms of disembodied
technologies and codified knowledge across technical fields but they are insufficient to measure the
distribution of capabilities. Technological capabilities should include also indicators on Embodied and
Disembodied knowledge, Codified and Tacit knowledge and Generation and Diffusion of knowledge
(Archibugi and Coco, 2005). Therefore, even considering the assumption that complementarities do
exist between all three categories, the use of patents alone underestimates the set of aspects that
transform a competence into a capability. Second, patents underestimate the contribution or closeness
of scientific bases to the creation of the technical bases because of “the lack of engineering capabilities
to embody scientific results in profitable products” (Brusoni and Geuna, 2003). In this sense, a country
could have strong competences and capabilities in development weakly supported by basic knowledge
(ibidem). Third, measuring technological specialization to the development of specific products and
industries involve a classification of technological fields that does not respond to the usual ones in
patent classifications. Therefore, additional criteria for product aggregation are necessary. Fourth,
some national technological competences can be underestimated when they are built on non-patentable
technologies (or bases of knowledge) or on technologies that are not protected by patents.
         Finally, four major methodological aspects worth to be noted in relation to the treatment given
to the information contained in the patent database. First, patents are de only one source of information
that synthetize national R&D efforts with potential of innovation by technical field. Second, the
inventor residence gives the nationality to the patent. Third, as national competences must include all
the agents and organizations that create competences, database includes patents filed by any applicant,
as be firms, universities, public research centers, government agencies and independent inventors
(Brusoni and Geuna 2003). Fourth, one patent represent a technology that combine different types of
knowledge. For this reason, one only patent may be classified in more than one technical field. This
paper uses all technical fields from each patent to account technological competences. This means that
a single patent becomes as many competences as technical fields it contains.


       4. The evolution of technology specialization patterns.
       4.1. Mobility and instability.
         The traditional measure of technological opportunity is the growth of the patents share by
technology (𝑝̇𝑖 ). Nevertheless, as the patent database was extended to account technological
competences, the indicator shape the growth of the share of the competences involved in the production
of a i-technology on the total world competences (𝑐̇𝑖 ; 𝑐𝑖 > 𝑝𝑖 ). This indicator depends on the dynamism
of the main technologies to which the competence (technical field) is linked in, but also on the
frequency that the competence complements other technologies, this is, their pervasiveness.
       The most dynamic and pervasive technologies between eighties and the two thousand are
shown in Table 1. The temporal choice obey to two factors that altered the distribution of technological
opportunities across technologies along the nineties. The nineties represent the decade of the expansion
of the new technological paradigms (electronics, telecommunications, biotechnologies,
semiconductors and new materials), which represented open windows of opportunity for developing
countries. In addition, most of countries in the sample liberalized their international markets
[commerce of goods and services, capital openness, or both], which accelerate the technology transfer
and the catching up. Data reveals that the main paradigms emerging in the eighties
(telecommunications, information technologies, audiovisual, semiconductors or electronics) are
among the most dynamic and pervasive technologies. They are also considered as technologies of high
impact on exports and growth (Lall, 2000). Nevertheless, others like biotechnology, optics or
pharmaceuticals and cosmetics presented a low opportunity or pervasiveness in the same period.
Alternatively, some competences linked to medium-low technological intensity products in exports
showed high opportunity and pervasiveness along time like Surfaces, Handling, Consumer Goods or
Material processing. Technological competences related to products based in natural resources
presented a low opportunity and pervasiveness.
        The analysis by country shows that, excepting Hong Kong, all Asian countries increased their
share of competences in dynamic technologies, being especially strong in South Korea
(semiconductors      and    telecommunications);     China    (telecommunications)     and     India
(telecommunications and audiovisual technologies). The expansion of competences was not only
restricted to dynamic and pervasive technologies, but also to stagnant. This configures a path of
evolution based on diversification of the technological base by complementarity. Singapore and
Taiwan show moderate increments of their shares, with the exception of Singapore in Semiconductors.
Hong-Kong address losses of share in most of dynamic technologies that are not offset with increases
of shares in stagnant technologies.

        Latin American countries, with traditional TSP based on the exploration or natural resources,
also increased their contribution to the world technological competences in dynamic technologies, but
in much less extend, losing share in Audiovisual and Semiconductors. The highest growth were
obtained by Brazil in Surfaces; by Argentina in Materials processing; and by Mexico in Information
Technologies and Electronic Devices. The trend is quite similar in competences related to technologies
of stagnant opportunity or low pervasiveness, which means a TSP evolution partially based on the
substitution of the technological efforts from one competences to another.
          To test the hypotheses about mobility and instability two exercises will be done. The first one
tests if there are initial distributions that favors the growth of technology share in the following periods
better than others do. Shift-share analysis testes this by decomposing the rate of growth of a share of
total technological competences of a country with respect to an area of reference (𝑐𝑗̇ ) in three different
effects (Laursen 1999):
                                      ̇ 𝑡−1           𝑡−1           𝑡−1
                               𝑐̇𝑗 = ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑗  𝑐𝑖𝑗̇ + ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑗  𝑜𝑖𝑗̇ + ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑗  𝑐𝑖𝑗̇ 𝑜𝑖̇
                                      𝑖              𝑖               𝑖

        Where (𝑐𝑖𝑗̇ ) denotes the growth of the j-country share in the i-technology over the same
technology in the world (presented in table 1); (𝑜𝑖̇ ), the growth of the i-technology share, which is the
                                                      𝑡−1
proxy of its technological opportunity; and (𝑠𝑖𝑗           ) the share distribution of the j-country by i-
                                                                   𝑡−1
technology in the initial period. The first component, ∑𝑖 𝑠𝑖𝑗          𝑐𝑖𝑗̇ , named ‘technology share effect’,
measures the fraction of growth due to the dynamism of national patenting activity strictly
                                                                           𝑡−1
(technological activity in the wide sense). The second factor, ∑𝑖 𝑠𝑖𝑗          𝑜𝑖̇ , named ‘structural technology
effect’, measures the fraction of growth due to a given initial specialization pattern. This component
measure the effect of initial ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ specializations. A positive signal of this component
means that the country had an initial distribution of its competences more concentrated in the
technologies that registered the higher rates of growth, and negative if the contrary. Therefore, the
higher specialization in dynamic technical fields is (𝑜𝑖𝑗̇ > 0), the stronger effect of technological
                                                 𝑡−1
opportunity will be. The third factor ∑𝑖 𝑠𝑖𝑗         𝑐𝑖𝑗̇ 𝑜𝑖𝑗̇ shapes a residual effect called ‘technology
adaptation effect’. It takes negative values when the country left high TO fields (or went into staged
TO fields); and takes positive values when the country went into high TO fields (or went out staged
TO fields). That factor represents a measure of the mobility conducted by technological opportunity
and patenting activity (in the strict sense).
        Shift-share results in table 2 shows that Latin American countries registered high growths of
their share of patents [competences] in the world (Total effect): Argentina (143,4%), Brazil (217.3%)
and Mexico (172.1%). The technological effect is the main explanatory driver for this tendency
compensating the negative effect from an unfavorable initial specialization (Brazil) and from a wrong
direction of the technological efforts in relation to the direction of the technological opportunity (cases
of Argentina and Mexico). Asian countries show extraordinary high rates of growth in their patent
shares (competences) when compared to the Latin American ones, excluding Hong-Kong. The total
effect in Hong-Kong shows that the country practically did not alter their share of patents in the world.
China, South Korea and India registered the highest performances with four-digit rates of growth,
followed with similar performance by Singapore and Taiwan. As in the Latin American case, most of
the Total Effect is explained by the Technological Effect, this is, by own technological efforts. The
Structural Effect is insignificant or even negative (China, India and Singapore). The initial
unfavouravel distribution of competences was not a constraint to limit the possibilities of technological
growth in any country along the decades. Nevertheless, and in opposition to Latin American, the
adaptation effect, even being small but higher than the structural effect, is positive in all Asian
countries -excepting India-. This result means that the technological efforts to build competences were
in the 'correct' direction, this is, Asian countries follow the same direction pointed by opportunity and
pervasiveness.

        Pearson correlations confirms the above results. The correlation between the growth of
technology share and the Technological Effect by technology is positive and significant in most of the
countries. Taiwan and South Korea show also positive but low correlations, which means low
association between the direction of national efforts and the highest rates of patent-growth. Only in the
case of India, the correlation becomes negative.
        Alternatively, the correlation between the growth of technology share and the Structural Effect
by technology is low and negative in all American countries, Hong-Kong and South Korea. That result
points out that there was no technological determinism. Unfavourable initial positioning in these
countries was not a constraint to increase their technological share. For countries that show positive
values, the correlations are not significant, excepting maybe in the case of China where the taking of
advantages of their initial specialization looks to be higher.
        The final correlation between the rate of growth of technology share and the adaptation effect
show a clear pattern between Latin American countries plus Hong Kong and the rest of the Asian
countries. The former group present negative correlations, which means that the national efforts were
concentrated on technologies that did not follow the correct direction defined by technological
opportunity. In opposition, the latter group present positive correlation, which is an evidence that the
success of Asian countries for catching up was due to a concentration of the technological efforts
following the direction of the technological dynamism. The values vary across countries. It is worth
noting the correlation value for China (0,91).
       To analyze the role of technological opportunity and cumulativeness on mobility, two
indicators of mobility are defined considering the way countries build capabilities. To do that,
technological competences are classified as core, niche, background or marginal (Patel and Pavitt,
1997). Core competences represent technological strengths and marginal competences represent
technological shortcomings. Both, niche and background competences, represent the potential and the
natural trend of technological growth. Niche competences explore technological niches from previous
cumulative knowledge and background competences allow the exploration of new technological
opportunities by using developed absorptive capacity to catch up. Under those considerations,
"mobility by continuity" happens when core competences in the final period come from background
or niche competences in the initial period; o when niche come from background (or vice versa).
However, when countries built core, niche or background competences (final period) from marginal
competences (initial period) is because they acquired the ability to make a technological leap by taking
the advantages of “windows of opportunity”. This is the case of "mobility by discontinuity". Formally,
the variables are vectors that takes the following values:
                    𝑐̇𝑐𝑗 ,    𝑐; 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑙𝑑𝑠 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑚𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦
          𝑀𝑗𝑐 = {                                                                       }
                                                0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
               𝑐̇ ,          𝑑; 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑙𝑑𝑠 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑚𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑏𝑦 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦
        𝑀𝑗𝐷 = { 𝑑𝑗                                                                        }
                                                0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒


       As 𝑐̇𝑐𝑗 and 𝑐̇𝑑𝑗 are subsets of 𝑐̇𝑖𝑗 , the contribution of mobility by continuity (𝑀̂𝑗𝑐 ) and of
mobility by discontinuity to growth (𝑀̂𝑗𝑑 ) by country can be calculated using the technological effect
as follows:

                                          ̂𝑗𝐶 = 1⁄ ∑ 𝑠𝑖𝑗

                                                        𝑖

        As presented in table 3, the contribution of mobility by discontinuity is much more significant
than the contribution of mobility by continuity. That means that most of the growth of the world
competences share is due to the building of new capabilities, and not from the old ones. All countries,
without exception, took advantages from the 'windows of opportunity' opened by the new
technological paradigms and by the market integration and made a technological leap. The highest
contributions are registered in Hong-Kong (54%); China (43%) and Taiwan (40%). The contribution
of mobility by continuity is much less significant, being higher in Singapore (20%) and Mexico (17%).
In Argentina, Taiwan, South Korea and China, there were no mobility across competences by
continuity at all. The question that remains is: In which technologies countries made the technological
leap?. To answer that question, the mobility indicators were correlated with the national technological
performance measured by the Total Effect (𝑐̇𝑗 ) and with the indicator of technological opportunity and
pervasiveness (𝑜̇ 𝑖 ). Pearson correlations show that mobility by continuity is associated neither with the
direction and intensity of national technical efforts [excepting in Singapore] nor with the direction of
the technological opportunity [which is always negatively associated with] (Table 3). In opposite,
mobility by discontinuity is quite highly associated with the direction and the intensity of technology
efforts. The highest values are reached by China (0,94) and Brazil (0,67). Mexico (0,10), Hong-Kong
(0,18) and Argentina (0,26) present the lowest correlation. The association between mobility by
discontinuity and technological opportunity show a clear difference between both, Latin American and
Asian countries. In Latin American countries, the technological leap did not follow the direction of
technological opportunity and pervasiveness, so the Pearson correlations are negative or very low.
Nevertheless, Asian countries show positive and quite high correlations [China (0,75); India (0,72);
Taiwan (0,56)], which means that the technological leap happened on the most dynamic and pervasive
technologies. This is the main difference between both groups of countries.

        4.2. Persistence and Stability.
        Stability of TSP is linked to the persistence of specific specializations (and despecializations)
as the learning processes and knowledge accumulation are path-dependent. There are several measures
of persistence in de literature according to the used definition. In this work, we will estimate three
procedures to measure persistence. First one came from the definition of persistence at the firm level
as “the conditional probability that innovators at time t will innovate at time t+1” (Malerba et al.,
1997:804). Therefore, persistence at national level is the conditional probability of maintaining the
specialization in period t at time t+1. This implies to assume that once a technological capability is
achieved, it will keep stable.
      The measure most widely used for specialization is the ‘Normalized Revealed Technological
                                        (𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗 − 1)                                𝑐
Advantage’ (NRTA) defined as 𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗 =                ⁄(𝑅𝑇𝐴 + 1) , where 𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗 = 𝑖𝑗⁄𝑜𝑖 . NRTA
                                                            𝑗
varies between [-1, 1]; [-1,0) values indicates despecialization and (0, 1] indicates specialization. Using
NRTA, the measure of ‘persistence in specialization’ (𝑃 𝑆 ) is formally as follows:
                                                                    𝑃(𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡 > 0 ∩ 𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡+1 > 0)
                𝑃𝑠 = 𝑃( 𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡+1 > 0 ∣∣ 𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡 > 0 ) =
                                                                               𝑃(𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡 > 0)
        Second is ‘persistence in despecialization’ (SD), which measures the conditional probability of
not be specialized in t given that the country was de-specialized in t-1.Formally,
                                                                     𝑃(𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡 < 0 ∩ 𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡+1 < 0)
                𝑃𝐷 =     𝑃( 𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡+1     < 0 ∣∣   𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡   < 0) =
                                                                               𝑃(𝑁𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑗𝑡 < 0)
        A probability close to value 1 means stabilization of the TSP, while values moving away from
one points out turbulence. All probabilities were calculated for a level of aggregation of 30 technical
fields according to FISIR classification.
         If the previsions about cumulativeness are correct, the probability to persist in des-
specialization should be stable along time due to the difficulty to create new competences and
capabilities from no previous relevant efforts. Persistence in specialization usually follows the same
pattern of stability. Nevertheless, in developing countries, the stages of technological development are
not still mature and some turbulence in specialization is expected. Along with the process of building
of capabilities, some competences can have been created randomly and will not persist. In addition,
spillovers and synergies among technology systems stimulate some mobility when specialization
pushes the development of new competences in linked technologies.

        Graph 1 reports the evolution of 𝑃𝑠 and 𝑃𝐷 . Asian countries show a trend to stabilize their
specializations until the final nineties going toward value 1. India and South Korea went ahead in this
trend reaching value 1 in the two thousand. Nevertheless, China, Hong-Kog, Singapore and Taiwan
revert de stabilization pattern, moving away from the value 1 along the last decade. Latin American
countries follow a similar path, even they achieve lower values for the probability to persist in their
specializations. Brazil trends to stabilize their specializations after a short period of turbulence in
nineties. Mexico shows the same evolution, but with a higher level of turbulence in the nineties.
Argentina shows the highest instability, which indicates a slower process of building of competences.
        In general, persistence of despecialization is higher than the persistence of specialization, as
theoretically expected. That means that the difficulty to create new competences in technical fields
with no previous innovation efforts is high. The cumulative effect of learning allows creating new
competences in technical fields related to previous capabilities along specific trajectories of
technological diversification. As the distribution of competences is country-specific, the path of
technological diversification depends on the specific bases of knowledge and their associated
technological trajectories. The stability of despecialization patterns is more similar among the
countries, although in general is higher in Asia than in Latin America. All the Asian countries reached
value 1 or values quite close. Only Singapore moved away timidly at the final two thousands.
        The second definition for persistence as “the degree of serial correlation in innovative
activities” Malerba et al., 1997:804) inspired a second indicator: the Pearson correlation coefficient
between the NRTA between two consecutive periods (Pavitt 1989; Brusoni and Geuna, 2003). A
positive and significant Pearson coefficient would confirm the cumulativeness as the main explicative
factor of stability of TPS throughout time. Results reported in table 3 do not reveal strong differences
between Latin America and Asia in the stability of their TSP. At the initial periods, correlations are
low (even negative in Singapore and China) which indicates some turbulence. But during the nineties
and first two thousands, the TSP trend to stability reaching values between 0,7-0,9. Argentina and
Hong Kong display a moderate turbulence in all periods.

       Finally, the third measure is the parameter (β) obtained by regressing the distribution of
symmetric specialization index values across the i-technologies in the final period (𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡+1 ) on the initial
period (𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡 ) by j-country, as follows:
       𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡+1 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖 𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖
        A β coefficient equal to 1 means that the TSP remained unchanged over the period. A β
coefficient between 0 and 1 means that the country decreased its des-specialization in technical fields
where it was negatively specialized at the beginning of the period (or decreased its positive
specialization where it was positively specialized). A β coefficient not significantly different from 0
indicates high turbulence, which allows rejecting the hypothesis that changes in specialization are
cumulative. A β coefficient inferior to 0 points a reversion in the pattern of specialization. A β
coefficient superior to 1 indicates that the TSP is increasing its positive specialization in technical
fields where the country was already specialized (Cantwell 1989; Dalum et al. 1998; Laursen 1998).
Nevertheless, a β coefficient superior to1 is not a necessary condition for increasing specialization
(Cantwell, 1989). Instead of β, Dalum et al. (1998) proposed the S-specialization index calculated as
β*/R*, being R* the correlation coefficient from the regression. S-specialization measures an increase
or a fall in dispersion of specialization levels between two periods (Laursen 1998). If S-specialization
is superior to one, specialization levels increased between periods. Otherwise, specialization decreased
if S-specialization is lower than one. The dispersion of a given distribution does not change if S-
specialization is equal to one.

        Table 4 displays the results of β-parameter and S-specialization indicators. The β-parameter is
always significant and only higher than one in Mexico and India. For the rest of the countries β-
parameter is lower than one. That means that, in general, countries increased the NRTA values in the
technologies they were initially despecialized or decreased the NRTA values in the technologies they
were specialized. China presents the highest turbulence with a β-parameter quite close to zero (0.224).
Mexico and Taiwan do not show significant changes. S-specialization is superior to one in all the
countries, which reveals that all of them increased the dispersion of their NRTA. Changes in the
dispersion of TSP was quite more relevant in China and Argentina. There are no relevant differences
across the rest of countries.


           4. Concluding remarks.
      Technological opportunity and cumulativeness are elements that compose the technological
regimes and both determine the path and trajectories of technical progress. The theoretical previsions
about how both alter TSP is ambiguous. As learning and innovation are path dependent processes, both
are associated to some kind of persistence. In addition, as knowledge is transversal, the technological
systems as connected and both may represent ways to mobility. In this sense, this paper aimed to find
some empirical evidence about how both contributed to the evolution of TSP in developing countries,
where the process of building of capabilities is less mature and stable than in industrialized countries.
        The decomposition of the growth of the technology share by country showed that in scenarios
of a certain technological turbulence, with new emerging techno-economic paradigms and
internationalization of products, firms and technologies, the paths of technical change could revert.
Initial bad positioning by specialization in stagnant technologies is not a constraint to increase the
world technology share or to move towards more dynamic technologies and go through open ‘windows
of opportunity’. Shift-share and Pearson correlations also showed that there are three main differences
between Asian and Latin American countries. First, although the Latin American performed a good
technological dynamism, the Asian (excluding Hong Kong) present a much more patenting activity,
which is quite related to the incentives given by appropriate institutional frameworks and public
policies. Second, Asian countries extended their technological bases to a broad set of dynamic but also
stagnant technologies. The catching up process diversified the TSP by the complementary of efforts in
a set of technology systems. That was especially relevant in South Korea, India, China and Singapore.
Alternatively, Latin American countries increased the technology share in some technologies but also
lost share in others. The catching up specialized the TSP by substitutability of efforts from some
technologies to others. Third, Asian countries focused their technological effort in the direction of the
more dynamic technologies coming from the emerging paradigms in eighties (semiconductors,
telecommunications, audiovisual, electronics). Meanwhile, Latin American moved also to some
dynamic technologies, but not related with the emerging techno-economic paradigms. This means that
catching up did not take the advantages of the windows of opportunity opened by that new
technologies.
        Persistence analysis used three measures: the probability to persist along the period, the Pearson
correlation index between two consecutive distributions of specialization index and the β and S-
specialization indexes. All measures confirmed an initial turbulence subsequently overcome, that is, a
general trend to stability, but with some qualifications. Persistence of despecialization is higher and
more stable in Asian countries than in Latin American countries. Persistence of specialization has a
different timing in the two groups. In the Latin American, there is a period of instability in the middle
of the nineties, while in the Asian that happens in the first two thousands, except for India and South
Korea that stand the stabilization trend. After the period of turbulence, Latin American countries trend
to stabilization rapidly while Asian countries remain with some level of instability.
        Correlation index allows evaluating if the intensity of the specialization remains between
consecutive periods. At the initial periods, turbulence is higher and the specialization values between
consecutive periods are not correlated. However, as time passes and TSP stabilize, the specialization
values trend to remain and correlation indexes become higher. That is clearly an effect of
cumulativness. Finally, β and S-specialization indicators allows to characterize the catching up in the
selected group of developing countries as a process that diminished the dispersion of high values for
specialization and despecialization, as well as allowed the countries to consolidate the specializations
achieved in the process of creation of competences and capabilities.
