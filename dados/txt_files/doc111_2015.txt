Abstract: Brazil is facing a demographic challenge due to important changes in age structure of its
population. In the last fifty years, the proportion of people aged under 10 dropped from 30% to 17% while
the proportion of aged over 60 increased from 5% to 10%. Changing in age structure population can affect
both demand and supply of goods and services. On the demand side, changes in age distribution can alter
the composition of household consumption among types of goods and services. It occurs because
preferences usually vary along life-cycle. The aim of this paper is to estimate the association between
household expenditure composition and the presence of children and elderly individuals in households.
This is the first attempt to estimate how household expenditure composition varies among households with
different age structure in Brazil. A typology of households was built to take into account household age
structure. Seven household groups were defined. The association between household age structure and
consumption composition was estimated through econometric models for consumption items present in
Expenditure Consumption Survey (Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar, abbreviated as POF) which were
aggregated into 15 groups. For each household group and each type of product, a model was run allowing
the estimation of “household- type semi-elasticity”. Mains results showed that households with elderly or
children present different patterns of consumption when compared to households composed by only two
adults. The marginal effects are greater for health-related goods, specifically health insurance and inpatient
care.

Resumo: O Brasil está enfrentando um desafio demográfico devido a importantes mudanças na estrutura
etária da população. Nos últimos 50 anos, a proporção de pessoas com idade inferior a 10 caiu de 30% para
17%, enquanto a proporção de idosos acima de 60 anos aumentou de 5% para 10%. A alteração na estrutura
etária da população pode afetar tanto a demanda e quanto a oferta de bens e serviços. Do lado da demanda,
as mudanças na distribuição etária podem alterar a composição do consumo das famílias entre os tipos de
bens e serviços. Isto ocorre porque as preferências normalmente variam ao longo do ciclo de vida. O
objetivo deste trabalho é estimar a associação entre a composição das despesas domiciliares e a presença
de crianças e idosos nos domicílios. Esta é a primeira tentativa de estimar como composição das despesas
domiciliares varia entre os domicílios com diferente estrutura etária no Brasil. Uma tipologia domiciliar foi
construída considerando a estrutura etária dos domicílios. Foram definidos sete grupos domiciliares. A
associação entre a estrutura etária dos domicílios e a composição do consumo foi estimada por meio de
modelos econométricos para os itens de consumo presentes na Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar – POF que
foram agregados em 15 grupos. Para cada tipologia domiciliar e cada tipo de produto, um modelo foi
estimado obtendo assim uma “semi-elasticidade de tipologia domiciliar”. Os principais resultados
mostraram que os domicílios com idosos ou crianças apresentam diferentes padrões de consumo quando
comparado com os agregados domiciliares compostos apenas por dois adultos. Os efeitos marginais são
maiores para produtos relacionados com a saúde, especificamente plano de saúde e serviços de atendimento
hospitalar.

1. Introduction

        The demographic transition has occurred differently across countries depending on the level of
economic development. In most developed countries, the demographic transition process has already been
completed and took two centuries to occur. By contrast, in some developing economies, such as China and
Brazil, this process has been fast and is still in its second stage, which is characterized by declining fertility
rates and increasing mortality rates. As other developing economies, Brazil is facing another demographic
challenge due to important changes in age structure of its population. In the last fifty years, the proportion
of people aged under 10 dropped from 30 to 17% while the proportion of aged over 60 increased from 5 to
10%. According to United Nations projections, in 2050, the proportion of elderly people (aged over 60)
will represent 29% of the whole population (United Nations, 2011).
        Changing in age structure population can affect both demand and supply of goods and services. On
the demand side, changes in age distribution can alter the composition of household consumption among
types of goods and services. It occurs because preferences usually vary along life-cycle. As a consequence,
if population is aging very fast this process might involve changes in household consumption. It is
necessary to reorganize the supply of goods and services to face these significant changes in the aggregated
demand composition. In turn, such changes are likely to trigger substantial sectorial shifts (Denton and
Spence, 1999; Fougère et al., 2007; Lefèbvre, 2008).
        Some important research has been done in this topic. Dewhurst (2006) used an input-output matrix,
disaggregated for elderly and non-elderly, to quantify sectorial impacts of changes in consumption pattern
associated to aging. Luhrmann (2005) using Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) estimated household
demand for goods and services in Germany between 2000 and 2040. Lefèbvre (2006) used a pseudo panel
to examine the aging effect on aggregate consumption in Belgium in two steps. In the first step the author
estimated the aging effect on the household expenditure of goods and services and in the second step, taking
into account the household consumption composition, the author predicted the aggregated consumption by
industrial sectors until 2050. Main results showed that an increase in expenditure on housing, health and
leisure and reduction in expenditure on clothing, equipment and transport.
        Recently, Kim et al. (2015) have proposed an extension to the regional econometric input–output
model (REIM) for the Chicago region integrated into a demand system that allows heterogeneity in
household consumption. The authors used aggregate consumption data present in Consumer Expenditure
Survey (CES) for the years of 1987–2011 and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to estimate the almost ideal
demand system (AIDS) with age- or income group fixed effects. In the extended model, distinct spending
patterns by cohort are major forces that drive differentiated changes in output, employment, and income.
The main conclusions reveal that a demographic change (e.g. an aging population) results in compositional
changes in consumption in the long run, consequently influencing other variables.
        In the Brazilian context, Almeida (2002), using data from The Consumer Expenditure Survey
(Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar - POF) estimated, for Brazilian metropolitan areas, the consumption
pattern considering two types of households: households with an elderly head and households with all
residents aged below 60. Main results showed that increasing age increases the probability of consuming
medicines products, goods and services related to health, and personal expenses and leisure. Similar work
was done by Neri et al. (2004). The authors compared the consumption vector observed in the whole
population with that one observed in households in which the proportion of elderly people is equal or
higher than 50%. Recently, Zanon (2012) by using an input-output matrix examined how population aging
affects the Brazilian productive structure. Data from Consumer Expenditure Survey-2008 was used to
disaggregate household consumption vector between elderly households (households with at least 50% of
elderly) and nonelderly households (households with less than 50% of elderly). All of these studies
indicated that population aging causes an increase in expenses of goods and services related to health,
domestic services, leisure goods and services in general.
        The aim of this paper is to estimate the association between household expenditure composition and
the presence of children and elderly individuals in households. This is the first attempt to estimate how
household expenditure composition varies among households with different age structure in Brazil. A
typology of households was built to take into account household age structure. Seven household groups
                                                                                                              3

were defined. The association between household age structure and consumption composition was
estimated through econometric models. For each household group and each type of product a model was
run allowing the estimation of household- type semi-elasticity. All consumption items present in
Expenditure Consumption Survey were aggregated into 15 groups. In fact, 13 semi-elasticity’s coefficients
were estimated for each type of household. Finally, a consumption vector was also estimated for each
household group making it possible to compare the consumption pattern among households with different
age structure.

2. Data

        This paper uses Consumer Expenditure Survey data set for the years of 2002-2003. This survey is
carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estatística – IBGE, 2004) every five years. The main aim of this survey is to estimate household
consumption expenditure in order to subsidize the build of the National Consumer Price Index (INPC).
        The 2002/2003 survey contains information about the population living in urban and rural areas in
Brazil. Its sample is representative for the 27 federal units, nine metropolitan areas, as well as for the whole
country. The sample size included 182,333 individuals living in 48,470 households. Data collection is
conducted through six questionnaires, five of them are organized according to type of expenditure: 1)
household and residents characteristics; 2) collective expenditure in durable household goods 3) collective
expenditure in food and cleaning, 4) individual expenditure; 5) individual earnings and wages. The last
questionnaire investigates living conditions perception (IBGE, 2004).
        In this paper, we use all collective and individual expenditure items calculated and annualized by
IBGE. The expenditure of goods and services were mapped into 15 categories of goods and services: food,
textiles and clothing, fuel and transportation, medicines, health insurance, inpatient care , durables goods,
other goods, energy, private education, financial services and insurance, services, services provided to
families, food consumed out of the household and housing. Services provided to families include mainly
caregivers to elderly and children. All expenditures are calculated and annualized by IBGE.

3. Household Typology

        In order to analyze aging effect on expenditure composition it is necessary to classify households
according to the presence of elderly residents and children. The classification of households is done taking
into account the number of adults (residents aged from 15 to 59 years stratified into two age groups), elderly
persons (residents aged over than 59 stratified into three age groups) and children (residents aged from 0 to
14 years stratified into three age groups) in the household. The disaggregation of elderly individuals and
children by age is important to allow the use demographic projections, even though their use is out of the
scope of this paper.
        Seven types of households were defined: households with only two adults; households with two
adults and one child (0-4 years old, 5-9 years old, 10-14 years old); households with two adults aged from
15 to 49 and one adult aged from 50 to 59; households with two adults aged from 15 to 49 years and one
elderly aged from 60 to 69 and finally two adults aged from 15 to 49 years and one elderly over 70´s.
Households including only two adults (15-49) were considered as the reference category for the comparison
of expenditure composition. In order to allow the identification of aging effect, households with elderly and
children living together were excluded from the sample. The seven groups of households defined in our
typology represents 20% of the total sample (48.470 households) surveyed by POF in 2002-2003, that is,
9.516 households. Table 1 reports the distribution of households according to each group. The largest group
corresponds to households with only two adults (3.221 observations).

        Table 2 shows the distribution of expenditures disaggregated by the 15 groups of goods and services
for each household type. It is worth mentioning that the most important expenditure items are common to
all types of households. Independently of the presence of children or elderly residents, three groups of goods
and services represent at least 40% of the whole budget: food, durable goods and housing. Despite of the
same consumption pattern, it is observed that the consumption of food increases with the presence of
children or elderly in the household, while expenditure with durable goods highly decreases for households
with elderly over seventies. Another item of expenditure sensitive to household composition is the
consumption of services that expand their participation from 6% in households with two adults to around
15% for domiciles with two adults aged from 15 to 49 and one adult aged from 50 to 59 years. Regarding
health services, the presence of elderly over seventies matter for health insurance and inpatient care
expenditure. Even though these items do not represent high participation in the whole budget, they increase
substantively: health insurance expenditure increases from 1.3% to around 3% for households with one
elderly over seventies. Finally private education expenditure is also conditioned on the presence of children
in the household.

3. Methodology

        The aim of this paper is to analyze the effects of household composition, especially the presence of
elderly and child, will be explored in terms of the allocation of household expenditure on consumer goods.
Specifically, the effects of presence of elderly and children are measured through the estimation of demand
semi-elasticities of household composition.
        One difficulty of estimating semi-elasticities on household expenditure regards data distribution.
Usually, there is a large portion of zeros, especially when household expenditure is disaggregated by
various products. The presence of high number of zeros occurs due to a significant fraction of households
present no any expenditure on various products. The tables 1 and 2 in the Appendix B reports the
expenditure distributions for all product groups taking into account the household typology. One possible
method of estimation is the Tobit Model which provides consistent estimates by maximum likelihood. The
censored regression analysis usually applies when the dependent variable is censored. Regarding
expenditure distributions, observations assume only non-negative values, which means, that data
distribution is left-censored at zero. In this cases, zero values are obtained as a result of the choice of optimal
consumption vector.
        In a censored distribution, only values above the censoring point (in this case, expenditure = 0) are
relevant for the estimation of the dependent variable, which means a non-negative expenditure constraint
on the estimation of the expenses5. Typically, the Tobit model expresses the observed response ( y ) in
terms of an underlying latent variable. The general formulation of the Tobit model can be represented by
the following relation (Tobin, 1958):

         y *  x'   u                                                                                                       (1)

where y * is an unobserved latent variable, x is a k 1 vector of control variables,  is a k 1 vector of
parameters to be estimated, and u is the random error term. The errors are assumed i.i.d., and in this case:

         u | x ~ N (0,  2 )                                                                                                  (2)

         In other words, the error term u has a constant  2 . This implies that the latent variable
y*   ~ N ( x  ,  2 ) follows a normal homoscedastic distribution.
                                      *
        As the latent variable y , is not observed in all its domain, it is defined a new random variable y ,
transformed from the original 𝑦 ∗ , which represents the response observed only for values greater than zero
and which are censored for values equal to zero. In this case, it follows that:

         y  max( 0, y * )                                                                                                    (3)

         This implies that y equals         y*   when   y*  0   and y equals zero when y *          0.   Formally, there is:

               𝑦 ∗ 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑦 ∗ > 0
         𝑦={                                                                                                                  (4)
               0 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑦 ∗ ≤ 0
         For a problem solving corner, E  y | x  has zero as the lower limit. Thus:
         E  y | x   max(0, x )                                                                                           (5)

 The usual least squares estimator fails in this case, being biased even in large samples where: a) the zeros in the data are kept
and treated like any other observation, or b) all zero observations are removed. Thus, the estimators for the coefficients would
be inconsistent (Wooldridge, 2000; Cameron and Trivedi, 2005; Cameron and Trivedi, 2009).

        The conditional expectation of y is always non-negative. By the fact that y * is normally
distributed, y has a continuous distribution over strictly positive values. Particularly, the density of y
given x is the same as the density of y given x for positive values.
        The Tobit model is based on homoscedastic variance of the error term u . If u ~ N 0,  2  – normal
and homoscedastic – then the ˆ estimator is consistent and efficient. Otherwise, it is inconsistent. Pagan
and Vella (1989) describe the conditional moment test that can be implemented after the Tobit model
estimation. If one of the null hypothesis of normality or homoscedasticity of errors is discarded, one option
is to use the Censored Least Absolute Deviations (CLAD) estimator (Powell, 1984; Wooldridge, 2000;
Cameron and Trivedi, 2005), which is consistent since the median  ui | Z i  0 .

3.1 Censored Least Absolute Deviations Estimator (CLAD) 6

        The CLAD estimator is a generalization of the semiparametric estimator Least Absolute Deviations
(LAD) proposed by Powell (1984) as an alternative to the Tobit model when data distribution is
heteroscedastic. Unlike the standard censored regression estimator, Tobit, or other approaches by maximum
likelihood, the CLAD estimator is robust to heteroscedasticity being consistent and asymptotically normal
for a wide class of error distributions. The properties of the LAD estimator are presented in Koenker and
Basset (1978).
        Starting from equation (1) and considering that the median of u given x equals zero:

           y *  x  u                      Med u | x   0                                                 (6)

       Equation (6) implies that Med  y | x  x ; in this case the median of y * is linear in x . By the fact
that y  max( 0, y * ) is a non-decreasing function, it follows that:

                                             
           Med  y | x   max 0, Med y * | x  max 0, x                                                   (7)

        As shown in equation (7), Med  y | x does not depend on the distribution of u given x . E y | x 
and E y | x, y  0 depend. In addition, the average and median functions have different forms. The
conditional median of y is zero for x  0 and linear in x for x  0 . In contrast, the conditional
expectation E y | x  is never equal to zero and it is a nonlinear function of x . Note that equation (7) has the
equation (6) as its only hypothesis; no other hypothesis about the errors distribution is necessary. Thus, by
(7), the CLAD estimator ˆ can be estimated by the following minimization problem:

                 N
           min  | yi  max 0, x  |                                                                        (8)
             
                 i 1


        For the linear model, the CLAD method provides estimates of regression coefficients by minimizing
the sum of absolute residuals. It is a generalization of the sample median to the context of regression as
well as OLS is a generalization of the sample mean to the linear model. If the dependent variable y * is
observed, then the median is the regression function x'  under the condition that the errors have a median
equals zero. Thus, the estimated CLAD can be used to estimate the unknown coefficients (Wilhelm, 2008).
        Powell shows that the consistency of this estimator does not depend on any other assumption about
the error distribution. Thus, u is robust to heteroscedasticity, consistent, and asymptotically normal for a
wide class of error distributions, since it only considers the median equals zero (see Deaton, 1997, Powell,

1984 and Buchinsky, 1994). The CLAD estimation procedure is operational by an algorithm proposed by
Buchinsky (1994) 7.
        As a limitation of the model, the estimator requires that at least 50% of the observations are
uncensored. However, in some cases, depending on the context analyzed, another quantile than the median
can be used in estimate and the parameters are obtained from a censored quantile regression model (for
further details see Wooldridge, 2000; Buchinsky, 1994).

3.2 Model Specification

         In this paper, an econometric model CLAD is run to estimate the semi-elasticities of types of
households. y. Additionally, a bootstrap procedure is estimated to obtain consistent estimations of standard
errors. The data source is 2002-2003 POF. One model for each product (except food and housing) and each
household type is estimated in order to obtain semi-elasticities of household composition. Six different
specifications for each product (13) are estimated. For all models the household reference category are
households with only two adults living. Semi-elasticities on food and housing expenditures are not
estimated because these types of expenditure are common to all individuals living in the household,
therefore it is not adequate to assume that elderly or children living in the domicile can cause variations in
the budget share of these consumption items.
         In all household typologies only 25% of total households present positive expenditures on health
insurance and education (See Appendix A). Specifically for inpatient care, only 10% of households spend
with this product. As noted earlier, a limitation of the CLAD model lies in the fact that the estimator requires
that at least 50% of the observations are uncensored. In that manner, it is not possible to estimate median
semi-elaticities for these three products (education, hospital care, health insurance). In order to find a
solution, these products´ estimation were done using other quantiles. In these cases, Least Absolute
Deviations (LAD) model was used. For each type of household (k) 13 models were estimated corresponding
to different products (i). To accomplish this task 78 models were estimated, 13 products and 6 types of
household.
         Table 3 describes dependent and independent variables included in the estimation. Independent
variables regards socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households. The dependent variables
are the annual expenditure per product for each household typology. Households were classified in seven
categories according to the number of adults, elderly and children: households with two adults, two adults
and one child aged 0-4, two adults and a child of 5-9 years, two adults and one child 10-14, two adults and
one adult aged 50-59, two adults and an elderly 60-69, two adults and an elderly 70 years or more. The total
sample was split into k groups according to household typology. Each subsample was composed by
households with only two adults and households for each type defined in the household typology. In order
to identify each type of household a dummy variable was built corresponding to zero if the household is
composed by two adults (reference category) and 0 otherwise.
          These dummy variables aim to capture marginal effects on consumption of goods and services
resulting from the presence of children and elderly in the domiciles.
         Control variables concerns socioeconomic status, head of household characteristics and local of
residence. The annual total expenditure per capita is used as independent variable instead of the total annual
income. Annual total expenditure is a proxy for household permanent income, being therefore, more
adequate to estimate marginal effects regarding household composition. Usually household expenditure
fluctuates less than income because individuals can use savings or credit to finance their consumption.
Besides, it is less subject to measurement errors in the Consumer Expenditure Survey because individuals
have to register all expenditures in a booklet provided by the interviewer while income information is self-
reported. Schooling of household head is also included in the model as proxy variable to socioeconomic
status. It also allows to control for information effect. Individuals can choose to consume differently
conditioned on their information. It is particularly important for healthcare services and goods. The local

4. Results

      This paper used the CLAD approach to estimate censored models instead of Tobit models. Tobit
models are usually adequate for dependent variables presenting normal and homoscedastic distributions.
The test results regarding Tobit estimations rejected the null hypothesis that the data come from a normally
distributed population (Appendix B). Table 1 of Appendix B shows that Tobit estimations presented
heteroscedastic and non-normal distribution of errors, resulting in inconsistent estimated parameters
(Wooldridge, 2000; Cameron and Trivedi, 2005; Powell, 1984). According to Wilhelm (2008) when
heteroscedasticity or non-normality cause bias, CLAD model proposed by Powell (1984) is the best
alternative to the censored regression. Given the large number of models (78 differ models), this section
focus on the main results concerning the coefficients of the six household dummies. Full results are reported
in Appendix C8. All estimations were implemented using Stata 11 software.
        In general, the models present a satisfactory goodness of fit to the data. Most of the estimated
coefficients for control variables are statistically significant. Table 4 reports the marginal effects estimated
for each type of household using CLAD. As the dependent variable is the logarithm of the expenditure
with each product, household dummy coefficients can be interpreted as semi-elasticities since captures the
marginal effect of the presence of an elderly person or to a child at domiciles compared to the reference
household. The reference category are households with only two adults living.
        Analyzing the dummies coefficients, the results corroborate the hypothesis tested: households with
elderly or children show different patterns of consumption when compared to households composed by
only two adults. For all types of household composition marginal effects are greater for health-related
goods, specifically health insurance and inpatient care. Other important result regards the association
between age and medicines expenditure. The semi-elasticity estimated for medicine´s expenditure increases
monotonically with elderly age.
        Private education expenditure also shows association with presence of children in the household.
Semi-elasticities estimated points out the expected effect, a higher increment is found for children aged
between 5 and 15. This association is also important for household with adults aged between 50 and 59.
This pattern can be related to university expenses to youth.

        Concerning medicines expenditure (third row of Table 4), it is observed that the presence of one
elderly persons aged over 70 increases this annual expenditure in 187% compared to households with only
two adults living. A smaller effect is also found for the presence of children in households. For households
with two adults and one child, independently of child age, the coefficient is always higher than zero and
significant. Besides there is a child age effect on household expenditure on medicines. Child growth reduces
the needs of medicines as their immunological is more developed. The coefficient decreases as the child
age increases, showing that there is life-cycle effect on this type of expenditure. For households with the
presence of one child aged between 0-4 years this coefficient is 0.94, decreasing to 0.72 for the presence of
a child aged between 5-9 years and to 0.49 for the presence of a child aged between 10-14 years.
        With respect to health insurance expenditure (Table 4), the magnitude of the effect associated to the
presence of children and elderly individuals is very high. The presence of one child aged between 0-4 years
increases the health insurance expenditure in 319% compared to households with two adults while the
presence of an elderly person aged over 70 increases this type of expenditure in 208%. An age effect is also
observed for this type of health expenditure. Estimated semi-elasticities present a well-behaved pattern, the
U-curve. It starts with a high effect for children aged 0-4 (319%), after decreases as child age increases and
then increases with age of elderly individuals.
        The expenditure effect associated to inpatient care is also important mainly to households with
elderly person aged over 70. In these households this expenditure increases by 217 % when compared to
households composed of only two adults (Table 4). Despite this significant association, age effect on
inpatient care expenses is not well behaved as it was observed for other types of healthcare expenditure. In
this case the U-shaped curve is not observed. This different pattern is probably related to acute events that
occur independently of age.

5. Conclusion

        This paper investigated the empirical relationship between household expenditure composition and
the presence of children and elderly individuals in households of Brazil. For this, it was proposed a
methodology to disaggregate the consumer expenditure by age groups using the Consumer Expenditure
Survey (2002-2003). As the information of Consumer Expenditure Survey of Brazil is aggregated by
households, the CLAD model was used to capture the marginal effects of each age group (adults, elderly,
and children) in household expenditure.
        Similar to what other studies (e.g. Luhrmann, 2005; Dewhurst, 2006, Lefèbvre, 2006; Almeida,
2002; Zanon, 2012), the results showed that changes in the age structure of the population have significant
effects on Brazilian aggregate consumption. The results obtained in the econometric model revealed
different consumption patterns depending on the household type.
        Analyzing the dummies coefficients, the results showed that the presence of children and elderly
individuals changed the consumption pattern resulting in different budget allocation favoring healthcare
expenditure. For the healthcare categories expenditure, semi-elasticities increased monotonically with age.
The results also showed that expenditures on medicines are more important for extreme age groups, which
means in the age group between zero and four years old and in the age group for persons 70 years old or
more.
        This paper is the first attempt to estimate effects of changing population age structure over
consumption profiles. Results showed that aging can affect aggregate demand through changes in
consumption pattern. The parameters estimated in this paper can subsidize public policy and planning of
healthcare supply and other goods and services.
