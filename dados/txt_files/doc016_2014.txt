Resumo
Este estudo apresenta novas evidências sobre a relação entre desigualdade e desenvolvimento de longo
prazo a partir de dados de diferentes regiões brasileiras. Novos indicadores de desigualdade são
construídos a partir de dados primários para os municípios brasileiros em 1920 (usamos o Censo de 1920,
que não foi sistematicamente utilizado para tais propósitos): o índice de Gini da distribuição de terras
(entre donos de terras e considerando toda a população) e a porcentagem de potenciais eleitores. Primeiro,
não encontramos uma relação significativa entre a desigualdade da distribuição de terras e a relativa
concentração política para os municípios considerados no início do século XX. Segundo, encontramos,
através de exercícios econométricos, relações entre desigualdade e desenvolvimento no longo-prazo
particulares para cada conjunto de observações: (i) uma relação positiva entre desigualdade da
distribuição de terras e desenvolvimento para os estados da região Sudeste, São Paulo e Minas Gerais; (ii)
uma ausência de relação significativa entre os indicadores de desigualdade no início do século XX e
desenvolvimento contemporâneo para o estado de Pernambuco; e (iii) uma relação negativa entre
desigualdade e desenvolvimento para o Rio Grande do Sul. Terceiro, não encontramos uma relação
estatisticamente robusta entre nosso indicador de concentração política e desenvolvimento no longo-
prazo. O que seria um resultado possivelmente contra-intuitivo à luz da literatura internacional, é
provavelmente consistente com um sistema político capturado e níveis bastante baixos de acesso ao voto.
Os resultados acima são mantidos mesmo após controlarmos para proxies de mudanças estruturais
ocorridas no período, entre elas: urbanização, industrialização e imigração. Além desses resultados,
apresentamos evidência de que a desigualdade da distribuição da terra em 1920 é, no máximo, fracamente
relacionada à desigualdade contemporânea para Minas Gerais e São Paulo, enquanto é significante para o
Rio Grande do Sul e Pernambuco. Estes resultados ressaltam a importância do estudo de elementos
históricos no seu respectivo contexto, uma vez que são consistentes com um Brasil rural dominado por
elites agrárias em um complexo ambiente institucional.

Abstract
In this paper, we present evidence on the relationship between inequality and long-term development
using data on different Brazilian regions. New inequality indicators are constructed from scratch for
Brazilian municipalities in 1920 (using the Census of 1920, which, surprisingly, had thus far been ignored
for such purposes). We find no significant relationship between economic (land) inequality (proxied by
the Land Gini) and political concentration (proxied by the percentage of eligible voters) for Brazilian
municipalities in the early twentieth century. Econometric analysis indicates a positive robust relationship
between economic inequality and long-term development indicators for Southeastern states: São Paulo
and Minas Gerais; we find no relationship for Pernambuco; and a positive and robust relationship for Rio
Grande do Sul. We found no evidence of a robust relationship between the percentage of eligible voters
and long-term development, a surprising result in light of the results provided in development literature,
but likely consistent with a politically captured system with very low levels of enfranchisement. These
results are shown to hold even when controlling for proxies for structural changes that happened in this
time span, namely: urbanization, industrialization, and immigration. Moreover, land inequality in 1920 is
at most weakly related to contemporaneous income inequality for Minas Gerais and São Paulo, but
significant for Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Sul. These results highlight the importance of the study of
historical and social elements in their respective context, as the results are consistent with the picture of a
rural Brazil dominated by agrarian elites within a complex institutional environment.

                                                 Introduction
         Undoubtedly inequality is one of the main issues in today’s world. It is a subject of intrinsic
interest, in the sense that it is related to moral concepts such as justice and fairness. It is also interesting
for its effects, for example, on the growth and on the educational attainments of a society. Ironically, it is
one of the most hotly-debated subjects within growth and development economic literature and one which
is far from reaching a consensus.
         A first wave of development literature (as characterized by Easterly 2007) presents the idea that
high inequality could promote growth by concentrating income into the hands of high-saving capitalists
(Kuznets 1955; Kaldor 1956). As presented in Aghion, Caroli, and García-Peñalosa (1999), the view that
wealth inequality could be growth-enhancing is based on two different arguments: (i) investment
indivisibilities; and (ii) the tradeoff between productive efficiency and equality. Later works indicate a
possible negative effect of economic inequality on growth, both theoretically and empirically. Several
mechanisms were suggested as causes of this, such as political economy mechanisms (Alesina and Rodrik
1994; Persson and Tabellini 1994), imperfect capital markets (Banerjee and Newman 1991; Galor and
Zeira 1993) and investment in human capital (Bourguignon and Verdier 2000; Galor, Moav, and Vollrath
2009; Galor and Zeira 1993), and the composition of the aggregate demand (Murphy, Shleifer, and
Vishny 1989).
         Three important studies followed, casting doubt on the robustness of what were then considered
consistent results, and finding a negative relationship between economic inequality and growth. Using
new data and panel techniques, Forbes (2000) finds a positive relationship between economic inequality
and growth. Barro (2000) and Banerjee and Duflo (2003) also present evidence against such a clear-cut
negative relationship. Finally, Easterly (2007) using an insightful instrument, finds again a negative
relationship between inequality and economic performance.
         There are also important studies correlating political inequality and development. Acemoglu
(2008) shows how political inequality may retard development due to the unwillingness of incumbent
elites to allow the entry of new agents. Elites might also block the introduction of new technologies
(Acemoglu and Robinson 2000). Bates (1981) shows how, in a politically concentrated environment,
there might be little interest in the provision of public goods, including schooling. As also noted by
Acemoglu et al. (2008), political inequality will also tend to be associated with the absence of political
competition and accountability, two factors that help to guarantee that political systems generate desirable
outcomes.
         Even more important for the present work are Engerman and Sokoloff’s comprehensive series of
insightful studies on the development of the Americas. Engerman and Sokoloff (1997; 2002) argued that
factor endowments had a major influence on the colonization strategies throughout the American
continent that, in turn, established different initial levels of inequality that account for the divergent
institutional paths of American societies that resulted in the differential development standards of these
regions today. Therefore, in Engerman and Sokoloff’s view, inequality had prejudicial effects on
development in a cross-country framework.
         It is in this context of apparently contradictory evidence that Acemoglu et al.’s (2008) study
belongs. Their study is the first to distinguish empirically between economic and political inequality in
their exploration of the effects of inequality. As the authors correctly note, economic inequality is
probably endogenous in regressions without a political inequality variable, since we expect them to be
linked, and this might bias the econometric evidence on the effects of economic inequality. The authors
not only construct different variables for economic inequality (the land Gini) and political inequality (a
political concentration index) but also deal with a constant de jure environment, the region of
Cundinamarca in Colombia, which, according to Pande and Udry (2005) might provide deeper insights on
the specific channels through which inequality affects development.
         The authors present surprising evidence. Overall, they find a negative relationship between
economic and political inequality for nineteenth-century Colombia and a positive association between
economic inequality in the nineteenth century and development outcomes in the late twentieth century.
These results are unexpected, as it is generally expected for Latin America to have high inequality, both
economic and political, and that they are positively correlated (mutually reinforcing each other). The
interpretation of the authors, based on Bates’ (1981) insights on Africa, is that in “weakly
institutionalized” societies, where few constraints were imposed on the actions politicians could take,
large landowners had the power to keep in check the rapacious tendencies of these politicians. 2
         We provide a similar analysis for the complex case of Brazil. With unique data from the beginning
of the twentieth-century – the Brazilian Economic and Demographic Census of 1920 – we were able to
construct from scratch unique indicators of economic inequality (the land Gini coefficient among
landowners) and of political inequality (the proportion of individuals that were eligible to vote) for each
municipality in selected Brazilian states. We not only analyze how inequality (both economic and
political) is related to long-term development, we also go further into analyzing how inequality is related
to long-term development allowing for different de facto institutional environments and controlling for a
constant de jure context (in line with Pande and Udry’s reorientation argument).
         Therefore, we are able to present in a new framework both the inequality literature and the recent
institutional literature (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001; 2002; Pande and Udry 2005; Banerjee
and Iyer 2005). We calculate the respective inequality indicators for all the municipalities in four
Brazilian states: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, São Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul. The states were carefully
selected in order to capture how inequality is related to long-term development in different de facto
institutional environments greatly influenced by the unique colonial experiences of these regions.
         The evidence is surprising. First, in all samples, we find almost no correlation between the land
Gini and the percentage of eligible voters in Brazilian municipalities in 1920. Second, and also somewhat
surprisingly, we find a positive relationship between economic inequality in the early part of the twentieth
century and contemporaneous development outcomes, for the sample as a whole, and for the states of
Minas Gerais and São Paulo, both from the Southeast region. Pernambuco, a Northeastern state, presents
no evidence of a relationship between economic inequality and long-term development outcomes, while
the evidence for the South, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, is that this relationship is negative. Third, we
find only a tenuous relationship between political inequality (measured as the percentage of eligible
voters) and long-term development outcomes. This is an interesting result, for it appears to contradict the
general view that greater political participation would foster development. Moreover, in states where
there is a positive relationship between economic inequality and long-term development (Minas Gerais
and São Paulo), we find no evidence of a correlation between economic (land) inequality in early
twentieth century Brazil and contemporaneous income inequality.
         This study not only presents new evidence on the relationship between inequality and long-term
development within Latin America, it also provides a new strategy for exploring the interaction between
inequality in general and the institutional structure of a society.

                                               The Data
The Census of 1920
        The Census of 1920 is the fourth population census and the first agricultural and industrial census
to have been conducted in Brazil. In accordance with the International Statistical Congress, which took
place in Belgium in 1853, the purpose of an agricultural census is to “indicate the facts in which the
complete knowledge of the conditions, process, and results of the agrarian statistics of each country at a
specific time, depends” (IBGE, 1923, p. v). Therefore, it is the first reliable survey of the agrarian
conditions throughout the nation.
        The Census contains detailed information on the quantity and average size of rural properties at
the municipality level, which enables us to construct our measures of land inequality, which we use as
proxy for economic inequality, for each of the four states of interest: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, São

    The concept of “weakly institutionalized” is developed in Acemoglu, Robinson, and Verdier (2004).
Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul.3 The average territorial extension of the rural properties is divided into the
following measurements: (i) less than 41 hectares; (ii) 41 to 100 hectares; (iii) 101 to 200 hectares; (iv)
201 to 400 hectares; (v) 401 to 1,000 hectares; (vi) 1,001 to 2,000 hectares; (vii) 2,001 to 5,000 hectares;
(viii) 5,001 to 10,000 hectares; (ix) 10,001 to 25,000 hectares; and (x) 25,001 hectares or more. We have
data on 115,655 rural properties in the 178 municipalities of Minas Gerais, 23,336 rural properties in the
59 municipalities of Pernambuco, 80,921 rural properties in the 204 municipalities of São Paulo, and
124,990 rural properties in the 71 municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul.
         The number of rural properties surveyed throughout the country is 648,153, with a total area of
175,104,675 hectares (Table 1), which corresponds to 20.6 percent of the country’s entire area.
Specifically, 65.1 percent of the area of the state of Rio Grande Sul, 56.2 percent of the area of the state of
São Paulo, 52 percent of the state of Pernambuco, and 46.1 percent of the state of Minas Gerais, were
surveyed rural properties (IBGE, 1923, p. xi).
         Table 1 gives us an indication of the concentration of land distribution in Brazil. Nearly half (49
percent) of the properties surveyed are smaller than 41 hectares. However, these rural properties
constitute only 3.5 percent of the surveyed area. The largest share of the surveyed area consists of
properties between 2,001 and 5,000 hectares (16.4 percent). Impressively, properties larger than 25,000
hectares correspond to 15.6 percent of the surveyed area (more than the area occupied by properties
smaller than 200 hectares, which is 14.9 percent).
         The Census also provides a broad set of demographic and geographic data for a total of 1304
Brazilian municipalities in 1920. As we can see from Table 2, the number of municipalities was 178 for
Minas Gerais, 59 for Pernambuco, 204 for São Paulo, and 71 for Rio Grande do Sul. The largest state is
Minas Gerais, with an area of 59,381,000 hectares, followed by Rio Grande do Sul (28,528,900 hectares)
and São Paulo (24,723,900), and finally, the smallest state, Pernambuco, with an area of 9,925,400
hectares.
         As expected due to its large area and economic importance, Minas Gerais is the most populous
state, with a population of 5,888,174 inhabitants. The second most populous state is São Paulo
(population: 4,592,188), followed by Rio Grande do Sul (population: 2,182,713), and finally Pernambuco
(population: 2,154,835). However, Pernambuco has the highest population density: 0.22 persons per
hectare. Figures for São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul are 0.19, 0.10, and 0.08,
respectively (Table 2).
         Table 2 also presents figures on the number of foreigners and occupational shares. Consistently
with the recent inflow of migrants, foreigners represent 18.1 percent of the population of São Paulo.
Figures for Minas Gerais and Pernambuco are much lower: 1.5 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. Rio
Grande do Sul, in between São Paulo and Minas Gerais and Pernambuco, has 6.9 percent of its population
composed by foreigners. Agricultural activities are the main occupation for the four considered states.
The percentage of individuals working on these activities ranges from 16.9 percent in Rio Grande do Sul
to 21.4 percent in Pernambuco. Figures for Minas Gerais and São Paulo are 21.0 percent and 18.3
percent, respectively. Industrial activities include a much lower share of the population. Minas Gerais has
the lowest share of population working in such activities: 2.5 percent. As expected, São Paulo has the
highest share of population working in industrial activities: 5.0 percent. Figures for Pernambuco and Rio
Grande do Sul are: 3.3 percent and 3.9 percent. Less than 1.0 percent of the respective populations work
in “liberal professions”.
         Considering the large and detailed data set provided by the census, we note with curiosity the lack
of studies using that data to determine levels of inequality. One possible reason is that the information has
not yet been digitized, which makes data collection very onerous. For this study, both data compilation
and elaboration of the indexes have been done from scratch and have resulted in what are, to our
knowledge, unique for the municipal level in Brazil for 1920.

Land Distribution and Political Concentration


3
  For some variables there are data available on the county level as well (and, obviously, on more aggregate levels, such as
states). Our interest is on the municipality level.
        Land has been very unequally distributed in Brazil since colonial times. Brazil’s agrarian structure
has been largely characterized by large landholdings. Figures from the Census of 1920 show that 71.5
percent of the rural properties surveyed were smaller than 101 hectares, while only 4.1 percent were
bigger than 1,000 hectares. However, these same 71.5 percent of rural properties corresponded to only 9
percent of the total area surveyed, while the 4.1 percent corresponded to 63.4 percent of the total area. Of
the 648,153 rural properties surveyed, only 461 (0.1 percent) were larger than 25,000 hectares, which
nevertheless corresponded to 15.6 percent of the total area surveyed (a higher proportion than the 535,256
properties smaller than 201 hectares, 14.9 percent). However, the larger the landholdings, the lower the
unit value of land (IBGE, 1923, p. xii).
        Table 3 presents the figures broken down by state, revealing several important features. First, Rio
Grande do Sul, with 124,990 rural properties, is the state with the highest number of properties surveyed.
Minas Gerais follows with 115,655 rural properties while São Paulo and Pernambuco had 80,921 and
23,336 rural properties, respectively. However, the total area of the properties surveyed is larger in Minas
Gerais (27,393,210 hectares) than in Rio Grande do Sul (18,589,996 hectares). This is consistent with our
second feature: while all states present a similar pattern to the country as a whole by presenting a higher
concentration of rural properties smaller than 101 hectares, there are important variations within this
pattern. Whereas only 26.5 percent of the rural properties in Pernambuco are smaller than 41 hectares
(with 48.1 percent smaller than 101 hectares), a total of 61.7 percent of the rural properties in Rio Grande
do Sul are smaller than 41 hectares (with 83.6 percent smaller than 101 hectares). The figures for São
Paulo and Minas Gerais are 48.4 percent (with 73.7 percent smaller than 101 hectares) and 32.3 percent
(with 60.5 percent smaller than 101 hectares), respectively. Third, of the total area surveyed, rural
properties smaller than 101 hectares represent only 9.2 percent for Pernambuco (with 2.8 percent of
properties smaller than 41 hectares) and 11.1 percent for Minas Gerais (with 2.9 percent of properties
smaller than 41 hectares). However, properties smaller than 101 hectares make up 17.9 percent of the
surveyed area for Rio Grande do Sul and 15.2 percent for São Paulo.
        Another important aspect of the agrarian structure of the four states is that the largest share of the
surveyed area is composed of properties between 401 and 1,000 hectares: Minas Gerais (20.1 percent),
Pernambuco (30.1 percent), and São Paulo (18.2 percent). However, for Rio Grande do Sul, properties
between 2,001 and 5,000 hectares occupy the largest area (19.8 percent). Finally, we highlight the
impressive share of properties bigger than 25,000 hectares in São Paulo and Minas Gerais: 7.4 percent
and 6.7 percent, respectively.
        With the available information, we were able to construct two types of measures of economic
inequality. The first one is the standard land Gini coefficient, which measures land inequality among
landowners. For each municipality we constructed the Gini coefficient using the same formula as Nunn
(2008):4
                                                   2 𝑛𝑖=1 𝑛 − 𝑖 + 1 𝑎𝑖
                                      1+ 1 𝑛 −
                                                         𝑛 𝑛𝑖=1 𝑎𝑖
where 𝑛 is the number of rural properties, 𝑎𝑖 is the farm size, and 𝑖 denotes the rank, where rural
properties are ranked in ascending order of 𝑎𝑖 .
        The average land Gini considering all the comparable territorial units (CTU) from the four states
was 0.61. The average coefficient was 0.60 for Minas Gerais, 0.44 for Pernambuco, 0.65 for São Paulo,
and also 0.65 for Rio Grande do Sul (Table 4).
        Although widely used, the standard land Gini does not capture one important aspect of economic
inequality: it does not take into account individuals who do not own land. If, for example, land is divided
equally amongst 10% of the individuals of a given society, while the other 90% remain without land, the
standard land Gini coefficient will indicate that this society is an egalitarian one. Therefore, if we want a
proxy for economic inequality for the population as a whole, we need an overall land Gini. We
constructed our overall land Gini for the municipalities in 1920 using the same formula as Acemoglu et
al. (2008) and Summerhill (2010), by computing equation (1) assigning zero land holdings to the


4
    The calculation is made using the Stata program ineqdec and ineqdec0.
estimated number of families that do not have land holdings. 5 The average overall land Gini for all the
CTU considered in this study, is 0.87. The average overall land Gini coefficients are 0.87 for Minas
Gerais and Pernambuco, 0.88 for São Paulo, and 0.76 for Rio Grande do Sul (Table 4).
        The Census of 1920 also allows the construction of our proxy for political inequality in the early
twentieth century: the percentage of individuals eligible to vote.
        According to the Constitution of 1891, only literate Brazilian men 21 and older were eligible to
vote.6 Therefore, using the data on population and literacy for the municipalities, we can easily calculate
the percentage of the population of each municipality which was eligible to vote in 1920. The average
percentage of individuals eligible to vote considering all the CTU of our study is 7.4 percent. In 1920, 8.2
percent of the population was eligible to vote in Minas Gerais, 5.4 percent in Pernambuco, 6.8 percent in
São Paulo, and 10.3 percent in Rio Grande do Sul (Table 4). We see that Rio Grande do Sul appears to be
more equal not only in an economic sense (overall land Gini coefficient), but in a political sense as well.
Moreover, we see a higher level of political inequality in Pernambuco, where a high percentage of the
population     was illiterate at the beginning of the twentieth century.
        We have also constructed, as robustness checks, two other variables for political inequality: the
percentage of individuals eligible to vote considering only the male population and the percentage of
individuals eligible to vote considering only the literate male population.

                                           Quantitative Analysis
Inequality and Long-Term Development
        In order to explore the long-term consequences for development in Brazil of land (economic)
inequality and political inequality, we exploit the cross-sectional variation in the CTU for our four states
of interest: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, São Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul.
        Following Acemoglu et al. (2008), we first estimate cross-sectional ordinary least squares (OLS)
regressions of the following form:
                                   𝑦𝑖2000 = 𝛼𝑔𝑖1920 + 𝛽𝑝𝑖1920 + 𝜹′ 𝒙𝒊 + 𝜀𝑖
          2000
where 𝑦𝑖       is a measure of development for the CTU 𝑖 for the year 2000, 𝒙𝑖 is a vector of control
covariates, and 𝜀𝑖 is an error term. The key variables in this equation are 𝑔𝑖1920 and 𝑝𝑖1920 , the (standard)
land Gini coefficient for the CTU 𝑖 in 1920 and the constructed variable for political inequality
(percentage of eligible voters) for the same CTU 𝑖 in 1920, respectively. Therefore, our main interest is
the consistent estimation of 𝛼 and 𝛽.
        The regressions will be estimated for five different samples. First, we will estimate the regression
using all available CTU. Afterwards we will estimate this regression for each of the four states
individually. We will therefore be able to capture possible different de facto institutional environments,
with such differences rooted in the specific colonial experience of each state. As dependent variables, we
will first use what we have been calling “main outcome variables”, which are the (natural logarithm of)
GDP per capita, the (natural logarithm of) average years of schooling, and infant mortality. These are the
three aspects of development needed to construct the HDI, income, education, and health attainments.
        As previously discussed (see Chapter 2), the inclusion of these specific states has a clear purpose.
Each of these regions is representative of a particular colonial experience within a constant de jure
environment. This likely led to different de facto institutional environments that might cause inequality to
relate in heterogeneous ways with each development indicator. Pernambuco is representative of an old
agrarian structure, of great importance during the colonial era due to the sugar production that, as stated
before (see Section X), had far-reaching implications for the political, economic and social structure of
the region. Minas Gerais was the center of the gold cycle and later became an important producer of
coffee and a center for the supply of goods for the domestic market. São Paulo was the main coffee
producer, and in the late nineteenth century became Brazil’s most important economic center, a position

5
  Acemoglu et al. (2008) use an estimate of 10 members per family, while Summerhill (2010) constructs his coefficients by
assuming 5 members per family. We constructed the overall land Gini with the assumption of 7, 10, and 15 members per
family. Our main variable is the one using an estimate of 15 individuals per family because it supposedly includes relatives and
other aggregates living in the same property, an important element in early twentieth-century Brazil.

that it still occupies today. Rio Grande do Sul had a later occupation with characteristics associated to
those of North America (see, e.g., Engerman and Sokoloff 1997; 2002), and vast numbers of European
immigrants (as in São Paulo) shaping its development path.
        The main econometric concern with this specification is the possible endogeneity bias generated
by omitted variables.7 In other words, if omitted factors in 𝜀𝑖 are correlated with the explanatory
variables, the estimation by OLS will generate inconsistent estimators. Easterly (2007), based on the
extensive economic history developed by Engerman and Sokoloff (see Section X), has argued that
growing conditions (topography, climate, and soil) favorable to the production of cash crops contribute to
higher inequality. Therefore, we will control for a rich set of covariates (included in the vector 𝒙𝑖 ).

Contemporary Outcomes
        Table 5 presents the econometric results with geographical and econometrics results.
        In summary, the first robust results linking inequality and long-term development within Brazilian
regions (Table X) provide evidence of a positive relationship between economic inequality and GDP per
capita and average years of schooling. These general results hide a very interesting heterogeneity between
states which, as already mentioned, had unique colonization experiences.

Overall Land Gini
      Table 6 presents the econometric result including the overall land Gini.
      Therefore, our empirical results suggest that the effects of land inequality among landowners
would dominate over the effects of the inequality of land distribution across the population as a whole.

Inequality Yesterday and Today
         Table 7 presents the econometric results with the contemporary Gini coefficient as the dependent
variable.
         Therefore, there is a positive relationship between economic inequality at the beginning of the
twentieth century and economic inequality in 2000 precisely in those states where we do not find a
statistically significant positive relationship between economic inequality in 1920 and development in the
long run. In other words, where economic inequality is not “structural”, there is a positive relationship
between inequality in land distribution and long-term development

De facto Institutional Environments, Structural Change and Further Results
         Tables 8 and 9 present the results with the econometric results.
         Thus, we have presented a robustness check for our hypothesis that the heterogeneous
relationships between economic (land) inequality within Brazil are due to the different de facto
institutional environments. Several regression specifications show that controlling for variables proxying
structural changes nonetheless maintains the heterogeneous results within the country. This evidence is in
accordance with the hypothesis.
         Finally, two additional investigations are conducted. First, immigration is another structural
change that might be related to the effects of inequality on long-term development. We have collected
data on the number of foreigners and included it in our regressions (as a percentage of the population).
Three results are noteworthy: (i) the inclusion of the new variable does not alter any of the results

 The key condition for OLS consistency is the absence of correlation between the independent variables and the error term. A
sufficient condition is the zero conditional mean assumption: 𝐸 𝜀/𝒙 = 0, which means that the error term is not correlated
with any function of the independent variables. In applied econometrics, endogeneity arises in one of three ways: (i) omitted
variable bias; (ii) measurement error; and (iii) simultaneity (Wooldridge 2010). Our main concern is the omitted variable bias
due to the inability to control directly for variables such as land quality. The usual formula for analyzing the omitted variable
                             𝑐𝑜𝑣 𝑥 𝑘 ,𝑞
bias is: 𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑚 𝛽𝑘 = 𝛽𝑘 + 𝛾               (Wooldridge 2010, p. 67). Our strategy in this study is to use a proxy variable solution.
                             𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝑥 𝑘
There are two formal requirements for a proxy variable for the omitted variable q: (i) the proxy variable should be redundant in
the structural equation: 𝐸 𝑦|𝑥, 𝑞, 𝑧 = 𝐸(𝑦|𝑥, 𝑞), where z is the proxy variable; and (ii) the correlation between the omitted
variable q and each xj be zero once we partial out z: 𝐿 𝑞 1, 𝑥1 , … , 𝑥𝑘 , 𝑧 = 𝐿(𝑞|1, 𝑧), where 𝐿(. ) represents a linear projection

discussed in Section 4.2; (ii) the immigrant variable is insignificant or of very small magnitude when
included in regressions including the land Gini and the percentage of eligible voters as independent
variables and an indicator of development as a dependent variable; and (iii) the immigrant variable is not
significant even when we control for the control variables included in Tables X and X. Appendix 5
presents the regression results.
        Second, quantile regressions suggest that, except for the state of Pernambuco, the already
mentioned results are concentrated in CTU with relative small values for the dependent variable, i.e.,
CTU relatively less developed have stronger relations between inequality in the 1920 and development
indicators in 2000. Appendix 6 presents the estimations for the quantile regressions.

                                                  Conclusion
         This study aimed to investigate the historical consequences of inequality and the role of
institutions. By focusing on the Brazilian case, we provided evidence of the relative and potentially
distinct roles of economic and political inequality on long-run development. We believe that analyzing
the effects of economic and political inequality is a necessary step to improve our understanding of the
causes of underdevelopment in Latin America.
         Our first contribution was to construct from scratch both economic inequality variables (the
standard land Gini and the overall land Gini) and a proxy for political concentration (the percentage of
eligible voters) variables at the municipal level for the states of Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, São Paulo,
and Rio Grande do Sul. The states were specifically chosen for the fact that they had different colonial
experiences, which probably shaped their de facto institutional environment. Our selection was made on
the basis of the abundant data provided by the 1920 Census, a source which, surprisingly, had not yet
been exploited for this purpose.
         Second, our analysis was set in a new framework. We not only explored the relationship between
economic and political inequality in Brazil at the beginning of the twentieth-century with
contemporaneous development outcomes for all comparable territorial units, we also explored these
relationships within each of the selected states. This strategy, made possible due to the rich variety of
colonial experiences within the Brazilian territory, allowed us to account for possibly different de facto
institutional environments rooted in the unique respective colonial experience of each state.
         The results are surprising. First, we find almost no correlation between the land Gini and the
percentage of eligible voters in Brazilian municipalities in 1920. Second, and somewhat surprising, we
find a positive relationship between economic inequality in early twentieth century and contemporaneous
development outcomes when using the whole sample, and for the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo,
both from the Southeast region. Pernambuco, a Northeastern state, presents no evidence of a relationship
between economic inequality and long-term development outcomes, while the evidence for the South, the
state of Rio Grande do Sul is that this relationship is negative. Third, we find no robust significant
relationship between political inequality, measured as the percentage of eligible voters, and long-term
development outcomes. Fourth, the effects of economic inequality are largely due to the concentration of
land among landowners, as shown by the insignificance of the overall land Gini.
         These are interesting results, for they appear to contradict the general view that economic
inequality would be costly for a society and that greater political participation would foster development.
The answer to this riddle might lie in the fact that political participation was very low in early twentieth-
century Brazil, and a marginal increase (the econometrically captured effect) might have given more
irrelevant votes to a captured political system, leaving the economic outcomes unchanged. In other words,
greater franchise might not have given the population more political participation. With regards to the
effects of economic inequality, when considering the land Gini in an agrarian structure, these are likely to
be strongly linked to collective action problems. In a captured political system such as Brazil in the Old
Republic, land concentration might have differing effects, especially when taking into account that, in
some regions, landowners were largely responsible for the provision of public goods. As thoughtfully
stated by Dell (2010):
       In existing theories about land inequality and long-run growth, the implicit counterfactual to large landowners in Latin
       America is secure, enfranchised smallholders (ENGERMAN; SOKOLOFF, 1997; 2002). This is not an appropriate
       counterfactual for Peru, or many other places in Latin America, because institutional structures largely in place before
           the formation of the landed elite did not provide secure property rights, protection from exploitation, or a host of other
           guarantees to potential smallholders (Dell 2010, p. 1899).
        Further important analyses were conducted. First, we find evidence that there is almost no
correlation between economic (land) inequality in the early twentieth century and contemporaneous
income inequality in states where there is a positive relationship between economic inequality and long-
term development (Minas Gerais and São Paulo). In other words, the positive effects of inequality are
associated with a particular structural organization at a specific time, in contrast to a more structural
inequality, which, as exemplified by the cases of Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Sul, would have either
negative or no significant effects on long-term development.
        Finally, our hypothesis, that different de facto institutional environments are associated with
different relationships between inequality and long-term developed was, initially, only implicit in our
analysis. Important structural changes that occurred during this time span might be responsible for the
heterogeneous relationships found previously between inequality and long-term development. Three
elements were our main concern: (i) industrialization; (ii) urbanization; and (iii) immigration. After
controlling these elements, our main results were maintained, strengthening our hypothesis. Interestingly,
we also found no significant effect of immigration on long-term development, even when controlling for
other structural factors such as industrialization.
        It is important to note that we do not argue that inequality is conducive to development. We
present evidence that inequality might be associated with better development outcomes in the long run in
a particular political context in a within country framework. It is possible that the theoretically harmful
effects of inequality are better reflected in a cross-country framework, in which the mechanisms are
related to the de jure institutional environment. In other words, relative equality would be better for a
particular country, but within an unequal country (with certain socio-political and economic
characteristics) more inequality would be associated with better outcomes.8
        Much work remains to be done. We mention some possible extensions. First, there are few works
that attempt to control for different de facto institutional environments. This strategy likely will provide
beneficial insights in order to better understand the development paths of societies. Second, empirical and
theoretical studies that offer a differentiation between within-country and cross-country effects of
variables are largely welcome.9 Third, models attempting to capture the within-country effects of
variables such as inequality in politically captured environments are lacking. Finally, the external validity
of our results remains questionable. Comparative studies within Latin America are a logical next step.
        As usual, when exploring such important issues, it is only possible to make a very modest
contribution to the small pool of knowledge, compared to the vast oceans of the unknown. Much exciting
and necessary work lies ahead.
