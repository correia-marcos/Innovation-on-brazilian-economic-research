We evaluate the effects of BNDES direct support for R&D on firms’ innovation efforts
and results. Using data from Pesquisa de Inovação (Pintec, IBGE) for the period of
2003-2014, a firm-level dataset that surveys innovation activities among Brazilian
industrial and services sectorial firms, and BNDES data on credit for supporting firms’
innovation activities over the period 2004-2014, we construct a panel dataset and
estimate the impact of the BNDES direct support over this whole period. We adopt a
Fixed Effects approach to deal with the endogeneity problem associated to the selection
of firms who receive the credit and then estimate the impact of the BNDES support on
R&D expenditures and New Product Sales. We also use a complementary approach
based on the Differences-in-Differences estimator to address the BNDES effects based
on a before-and-after evaluation design. Our findings show evidence of positive and
significant impact of BNDES credit on firms’ R&D expenditures for both estimators,
although the effects on New-Product Sales were not significant. Based on the FE
estimates, we obtained an increase in current firms’ R&D expenditures varying between
30% and 60% percent, depending on the specification used. We also found evidence of
a negative effect on future R&D expenditures, what might be associated to an
anticipating behavior of the treated firms’ R&D expenditures decision.

Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of BNDES innovation credit on
firms’ innovation efforts and results. There is a theoretical consensus that public support
is needed to promote firms’ innovation activities, especially research and development
(R&D), which can result in the development of new products and processes for society.
This process can ultimately lead to new market sales and create new employment
opportunities within individual firms.
Direct support for innovation based on credit or grants are then generally offered in
many countries to companies based on the idea that, without these incentives, firms’
investment in innovation would be suboptimal from the social point of view. That fact is
due to market imperfections, such as uncertainty and lack of appropriability. The first
makes credit market imperfect and the difficulty to finance innovative activities leads
then to underinvestment. The latter is related to the semi-public good characteristics of
knowledge.
As appropriability of knowledge is incomplete, externalities arise, which could lead to
underinvestment in innovation activities (Nelson,1959 and Arrow, 1962). In addition, in
an innovative environment it is important to consider interaction between agents and
innovative networks comes up (Teece, 1986). Hence, some kind of public incentive and
coordination is justified to spur private agents to interact and devote resources to
innovation (Mazzucato, 2011).
In Brazil, innovation public policy started in the 1970s at the same time the industrial
catching-up process was taking place in domestic market, previously occupied by
foreign firms (Furtado, 1964). Nowadays, in order to support innovation, Brazilian
government provides a variety of programs and tax incentives to support R&D activities
and induce innovation networks. Governmental resources for innovative activities
increased from BR$ 15,8 billion, in 2000, to BR$ 85, 6 billion, in 2013 (MCTI,
Brazilian Science and Technological Ministry). BNDES has had an important role in
this process, by offering innovation credit with better financial conditions to companies.
This paper focuses on evaluating the impact of BNDES innovation credit on innovation
efforts and results. Therefore, the main question to be answered is: does BNDES
support for innovation increase the level of innovation effort and result of supported
firms?
To answer that question, this paper uses a panel data econometric approach as applied
by other authors (David Hall and Toole, 2000). Despite the difficulty in capturing a
causal relationship among the variables (innovation efforts and results and credit), the
empirical evidence in general finds a positive effect in terms of correlation (e.g., Hall
1993; Berger, 1993; Irwin and Klenow, 1996; David, Hall and Toole, 2000; Bloom,
Griffith und Van Reenen, 2002; McKenzie and Sershun, 2010).
Most of the empirical literature on direct support for innovation focuses on studies that
econometrically look at input additionality. These studies are typically based on firm-
level panel data and usually estimate R&D demand equations using a dummy variable
for the innovation support (see Hall and van Reenen 2000). Although the focus on input
additionality is fully justified as a main criterion for evaluating direct support
effectiveness, a smaller number of evaluations have also addressed the effects of R&D
incentives on innovation outputs. Cappelen et al. (2008), for instance, investigated
output additionality in terms of introducing new products and processes and found
significant effects for innovations with rather low degree of novelty.
Brazilian empirical literature on innovation policy impact estimates the effects of
different government programs3, most of them focused on tax incentives. For example,
Avellar (2009) measures governmental programs impacts on R&D expenditures, using
Pintec and propensity score matching techniques. Her main results point to significant
impacts on R&D expenditures. Araujo et al. (2012) measure the impact of grants on
R&D employment. They showed R&D expenditures of the treated group grew at a
higher rate than those of the control group.
We noted that, despite there is an expressive number of papers that evaluate different
innovation programs, including Brazilian most important ones, none of them focus
specifically on evaluating BNDES innovation credit on input and output additionality.
This paper contributes to the Brazilian literature as it is the first one to evaluate BNDES
direct credit support, taking into account its significant role in National Innovation
System.
BNDES innovation credit

Innovation support is a strategic priority for BNDES, due mainly to its potential in
increasing companies’ productivity and competitiveness and in creating wealth, that’s
why BNDES finances investment projects associated with firm’s innovative activities.
BNDES innovation support has begun in the 1960s with the establishment of the
Technological Fund (Funtec), created to finance the technological development in
Brazil. After a long period without creating additional financing instruments dedicated
to innovation, the issue came back to the fore in the late 1990s through the creation of
sectorial programs and equity funds to support technology-based companies.
For example, in 1997 BNDES created a specific program, called Prosoft, to develop
software and information technology services national industry. In 2004, Profarma was
created to support pharmaceutical industry, an intensive research and development
sector. After that, BNDES launched Proengenharia program to support local
engineering in sectors such as automotive, capital goods, defense oil & gas, chemical
and petrochemical and shipbuilding.
On the 2000s, BNDES launched horizontal credit lines to support R&D and project
innovation in all companies, regardless of its size or sector of its activity: Linhas de
Inovação. The lines were created in addition to the existing sectorial support structure
(Prosoft, Proengenharia and Profarma).
Those programs offered better financial conditions to encourage companies to invest in
innovation projects. Their interest rates are lower than the ones charged in other
BNDES lines and sometimes fixed. BNDES innovation credit finances equipment
acquisition; training of employees; acquisition and licensing of intellectual property
rights; registration of patents, trademarks, designs and plant varieties; research and
development activities; among others.
To look closer to BNDES innovation credit, Table 1 presents BNDES data on financing
contracts to support firms’ innovation activities during the period 2004-2014. BNDES
had 598 financing contracts with companies in the whole period and this number
increased over time, going from 10 contracts in 2004 to 106 contracts ten years later.

3
    To a more detailed review, Rocha, 2015.
BNDES sectorial programs, Profarma, Proengenharia and Prosoft, concentrated almost
57% of the contracts in the period. Table 1 also shows that the horizontal lines for
supporting firms’ innovation, like the innovation lines, are the second group in number
of contracts.
The analysis of the evolution of contracting for the horizontal lines over time shows that
innovation line are gradually substituted for Innovation/PSI from 2012 on, because of
the more attractive financial conditions of PSI Innovation Program. The ‘Others’
category includes several BNDES lines that were irrelevant in terms of contracts or
those that were extincted.
On the other hand, Table 2 shows the total value of the loans given by BNDES for firms
to support innovation activities in the 2004-2014 period. It can be seen that BNDES
gave more than BR$ 16 billion in credit for firms during the whole period. The total
amount of loans grew over time, mainly after 2009, coinciding with the period of
BNDES expansion in the Brazilian credit market.
In terms of the amount of credit relative magnitude, Proengenharia was the more
relevant BNDES Program, with almost BR$ 5 billion in contracts in the whole period.
The total amount of loans for BNDES horizontal lines were roughly BR$ 3.6 billion in
the period, being the second most relevant category of financing. The amount of credit
for Profarma (approximately BR$ 3 billion) is more than twice the value of Prosoft,
what might be associated with the lower size of Prosoft firm’s compared to the average
size of Profarma firms.

By looking at firm-level data on the access of BNDES Innovation lines and Programs, we
note that the number of firms supported grows over time, from just 8 companies in 2004, to
71 in 2014, as it is shown in Table 3. This table also presents loan value distribution statistics
for firms during the 2004-2014 period. The mean value of the distribution of loans for firms
increased over the period, going from roughly BR$ 8.7 million to BR$ 32.5 at the interval
end.
However, given the loans value distribution is right-skewed, we observe the median is far
below the mean for each year. For instance, the loans median were BR$ 2,464 in 2008, while
the mean were BR$ 15,089. The median loan for supporting firms’ innovation varied between
BR$ 4.5 million (in 2004) and BR$ 14.8 million (in 2013). After 2009, the last quartile of the
loans distribution started to remain above BR$ 20 million per firm.

Additionally, Table 3 shows the share of large firms in the total number of companies
supported by BNDES Innovation Programs (accordingly to BNDES threshold) 4 increased
over time. In 2004, just 25% of firms were classified as large, while, in 2013, almost three
quarters of the firms were on that category.
Empirical Strategy

We estimated the effects of the direct BNDES support to firms’ innovation activities based on
two variables: R&D expenditures and new products sales. We estimated the current and future
BNDES effects and also looked at the effects on the variation of those variables.
We employed a microeconometric approach to try to separate how much of the difference in
innovation efforts and results between supported firms and not supported can be, in fact,
attributed to BNDES funding. The main problem associated to this goal is to deal with the
selection bias that can occur because firms that are more likely to carry out innovative
activities are more inclined to meet BNDES’ credit requirements.
We adopt a Fixed Effect approach to try to reduce the endogeneity problem derived from the
sample selection bias. In a fixed-effects model, firms variation over time serve as their own

  The threshold varied over the period of the analysis. In 2010, BNDES changed firm size classification: Big
firms were the ones that had annual or annualized Gross Operating Income higher than or equal to BR$ 90
million. For detailed information, see:

controls. The idea is that whatever effects the omitted variables have on the firms at one time,
they will also have the same effect at a later time, hence we can eliminate this fixed
components with those models.
In order to estimate BNDES effects on the current level of the outcome variables of interest,
we estimated the following equation:


𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽1 𝐵𝑖𝑡 + ⋯ + γ𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡                                           (1)


Where Y is a variable for effort or result of firm i in year t; B is an indicator variable that
assumes 1 if firm i in year t had BNDES innovation credit and 0 otherwise, and X are control
variables.


In order to estimate the effects on the future level of the variables of interest, we use another
specification:


𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽1 𝐵𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐵𝑖(𝑡−1) + ⋯ + γ𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡                                    (2)


Where Y is a variable for effort or result of firm i in year t; and 𝐵𝑖(𝑡−1) captures the effect of
BNDES credit on the future level of the outcome variables. This variable allows us to verify if
there is some anticipation effect.
We estimated these equations using a Fixed Effect approach, so we control for unobserved
heterogeneity that is time invariant.
Finally, we used a complementary approach to estimate the effects of BNDES support on the
trends of firms’ outcomes, based on the Differences-in-Differences (DID) estimator:


𝑌𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝐵𝑁𝐷𝐸𝑆𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐵𝑁𝐷𝐸𝑆𝑖𝑡 ∗ 𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 γ + 𝜀𝑖𝑡                            (3)


Differences-in-Differences methodology compares one group before and after the treatment
(i.e., innovation effort before and after BNDES credit). The identification assumption is that,
in the absence of the treatment, both groups would have displayed parallel trends.
Data

The Brazilian Innovation Survey (PINTEC) from IBGE (Brazilian Geographic and Statistics
Institute) aims to explore and measure the innovative activities developed in industrial and
service companies, as well as to monitor their evolution over time. The observations
contained in this database include companies registered in the National Registry of Legal
Entities (CNPJ), maintained by the Ministry of Finance. The companies covered by the
research are restricted to the sectors of extractive industry, manufacturing industry, electricity
and gas, music editing and recording, data processing and internet hosting,
telecommunications, information technology services, architecture, engineering, testing and
technical analysis and research and development (R&D) services.
Pintec is a triennial sample survey that is, in each reference year, Pintec’s time frame refers to
a period of three years: the survey year and previous two. By 2014, five editions were already
been published for reference years of 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2011. Pintec is consistent with
the conceptual and methodological guidelines of Oslo Manual of Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD, 1997) and because of that Pintec is comparable to any
other innovation database.
Pintec is composed of two topics - innovative efforts and results. The survey is designed to
produce statistically significant samples of companies in the 10 to 29, 30 to 99, 100 to 249
and 250 to 499 employees’ strata and attempts to cover all companies with 500 or more
employees. In addition, Pintec attempts to cover all companies that have received any
governmental support for innovative efforts, companies that have declared to carry out formal
R&D efforts and that have applied for patents.
For the other hand, BNDES Data includes information about firms’ innovation financing
contracts over the period 2004-2014. We found that BNDES had 598 financing contracts with
companies in the whole period. BNDES data considers only credit contracts, thus our data
filters out grants and equity BNDES lines.
Data preparation consisted of building a panel of firms for the 2003-2005 period. We use data
from Pintecs Surveys 2003, 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014. In order to maximize the number of
BNDES firms found on each year of Pintec, it was necessary to adapt the contract year of
supported firms in a way that converges to the specific Pintec year. As Pintec is triennial, we
related to each Pintec year, three BNDES contract years. For example, we linked 2014 Pintec
data to 2014, 2013 and 2012 BNDES contract information.
The variables explained by the econometric estimations include both indicators of innovative
efforts and results, respectively, R&D expenditures and New Product Sales. Our control
variables includes a series of firm size indicators such as number of employees, net revenue,
production costs, raw material consumption and wages. Also included was a labor
productivity indicator, calculated as the ratio of gross production value to total staff employed
in the firm. Finally, there is a dummy for firms in the industrial sector and another for firms
that have received other forms of public support for innovative activities.
Chart 1 indicates, respectively, the total number of firms in the sample and those treated by
BNDES support in each year of the analysis. The total sample includes 67,517 observations,
with a mean of 13,500 per year. The firms supported by BNDES account for 241 observations
of firms found in Pintecs over the whole period. The bank's support is on a growing trajectory
from zero in 2003 to 98 in 2014, the last year of the analysis.

Chart 2 indicates the total number of firms that promoted some type of innovation in each
year of the analysis, respectively in the total sample and among those treated by BNDES
support. The total sample includes 31,908 observations, with an average of 6.4 thousand per
year. On the other hand, the firms supported by BNDES account for 215 observations (89.2%
of the total number of firms supported).

Chart 3 classifies the firms included in each year of analysis according to the results of their
innovative efforts. As indicated earlier, BNDES-supported companies tend to be more
innovative than average. Whereas, in the total sample, 52.74% of the firms are non-
innovative, among those treated this percentage is only 10.79%. Most of the firms supported
are innovative in both product and process (68.46%).

Figure 1 presents the means of the variables used in the present study. It should be noted that
there are large differences between those supported by BNDES and the total sample. In
general, companies treated by BNDES support tend to invest more in R&D and are larger
than the others in terms of sales revenue, number of employees, operating costs, raw material
consumption, wage mass and productivity. This phenomenon certainly stems from a selection
bias, since the procedures for framing the firms' innovative projects in BNDES disbursement
policies tend to favor larger firms. However, the use of estimation techniques for panel data
with fixed effects accurately seeks to control this bias, since it ponders each observation by
the firm's average over time. This technique helps to better explore the contribution of bank
support to the innovative efforts of the firms observed.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the mean of the same variables over time. There is a general
trend of growth in continuous variables, especially from 2011 on. This trend is more
pronounced in firms supported by BNDES. On the other hand, the percentage of firms that
promoted some innovation was little altered in this period, remaining below 50% for the total
sample and about 90% for firms treated by the bank's support.

Results

Table 4: shows the estimates of the effects of BNDES credit on firm R&D expenditures. We
present results for the R&D expenditures in levels and in logs and compare estimates for
Pooled OLS and Fixed Effects estimators. We also compare results for base case estimates
(without sample restrictions) and for a sample where we apply a 1% trimming on the tails of
the distribution of the interest dependent variable, restricting the presence of outliers. For the
FE estimator, we also show results comparing estimates for an unbalanced panel sample and a
balanced one.
We progressively show the current effects of BNDES credit on R&D expenditures based on
these combinations (columns 1 to 10 of Table 4:), and our preferred specification (column 11)
estimates also the future effect on our dependent variables (coefficient on the BNDES lagged
variable on the table). We see that the estimated effects of BNDES on firm R&D expenditures
are positive and significant at the 1% percent level for most of the specifications.
The results for R&D expenditures (in BR$ thousand) show a decrease in the magnitude of the
effect when we compare the POLS estimates with the FE ones. The same pattern emerges
when we look to the dependent variable in logs, with a little increase in the size of the effect
for the balanced panel estimates. The specification in column 11 reveals a considerable
increase in the magnitude of the BNDES current effect (roughly 60% superior relatively to the
control group).
However, we see a reversal in the signal of the effect on firms’ future R&D expenditures
(column 11). This result jointly with the positive current effect can be, for one side,
interpreted as associated to an anticipating behavior of supported firms. In that view, the
positive current effect might be (at least in part) due to anticipating future R&D expenditures,
and not only with R&D expenditures addition. For the other side, we can view this negative
effect as associated with a more concentrated pattern of firms R&D investment cycles in
comparison with the non-treated firms, that could be otherwise smoothing their investment
cycles. Also, it is important to note that the magnitudes are different for the current and future
BNDES estimates, evidencing just a partial reduction in the future R&D expenditures for the
firm.
Table 5 shows the estimated effects of BNDES on Sales associated to new products
developed by the company. The pattern of the estimates presented is the same of Table 4:. We
note that the current BNDES effects are positive and significant only for the POLS estimates
both for the dependent variable in levels and in logs. On the other side, the FE estimates have
a positive sign but not statistically significant effect, and are lower in size than the POLS
estimates. This means that BNDES credit for innovation appears to have no current impact on
new product sales over the period analyzed. The coefficient associated to BNDES lagged
dummy was negative but not significant.
The analysis of the DID estimates of BNDES effects on firm innovation tend to show a
positive and (in some specifications) significant effect over the period 2005-2014. Table 3
shows the significant positive effects are concentrated in BNDES 2014-2011 and 2011-2008
DID estimates. Also the estimates tend to be more significant for R&D expenditures rather
than for New Product Sales.
The estimates presented in Table 3 indicate BNDES tend to have a positive effect also on the
variation over time of the innovation indicators analyzed here, additionally to the positive
effect showed for the variables in level. After all, BNDES estimates presented for the FE and
the DID estimator pointed to the conclusion that BNDES support to firm innovation tend to
have significant effects mainly for the R&D expenditures.

Conclusion

This paper aimed to evaluate the impact of BNDES innovation credit on firms’
innovation outcomes. Using data from Pintec for the period of 2003-2014 and BNDES
data on credit for supporting firms’ innovation activities over the period 2004-2014, we
construct a panel dataset and estimate the current and future effects.
We adopted a Fixed Effects approach to deal with the endogeneity problem associated
to the selection of firms who receive the credit and then estimated the impact of BNDES
support on R&D expenditures and New Product Sales. We also used a complementary
approach based on the Differences-in-Differences estimator to address the BNDES
effects based on a before-and-after evaluation design.
Our findings showed evidence of positive and significant impact of BNDES credit on
firms’ R&D expenditures for both estimators, although the effects on New-Product
Sales were not significant. Based on the FE estimates, we obtained an increase in
current firms’ R&D expenditures varying between 30% and 60% percent, depending on
the specification used. We also found evidence of a negative effect on future R&D
expenditures, what might be associated to an anticipating behavior of the treated firms’
R&D expenditures decision. Although this conclusion requires further analysis.
Future agenda will focus on decompose the analysis by company size and economic
sectors. We also intend to employ alternative approaches for estimating the BNDES
impact on innovation such as dynamic panel and quasi-experimental empirical
strategies. Besides we will look at other innovative dimensions than the ones presented
in this work.
