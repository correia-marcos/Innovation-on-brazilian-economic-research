Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of changing family structure on the income distribution in
Brazil between 1981 and 2011. Specifically, the paper evaluates how changes in the composition of
the types of families within the richest and poorest family groups contributed (i) to increase per
capita income, (ii) to reduce inequality and (iii) to reduce the poverty. Additionally, the paper
provides a comparison between rural and urban areas in order to understand how these dynamics
had different impacts on more developed (urban) and less developed (rural) areas. Results highlight
that changes observed in the family structure were more pronounced among the richest families,
contributing to increase the income of the richest families and the income inequality between richest
and poorest families, as well as between urban and rural areas. The overall impact on poverty
reduction was insignificant. Finally, the paper investigates the per capita income composition by
different types of income source (labor, pensions and others) and changes in the period of analysis.

Introduction

        Demographic changes have important implications for income distribution and social
inequalities (McLanahan & Percheski, 2008). First, the volume and distribution of resources depend
directly on the size and the distribution of families among the poorest and richest households
(Barros, et al., 2001). Additionally, demographic dynamics tend to affect the labor force supply and
the dependency ratio differently across social groups, impacting indirectly on the income
distribution and living conditions of the poorest and richest families (Lee, 2005).
        Demographic changes use to be in sync with economic development (Ashraf, et al., 2011).
For instance, changes in the family structure tend to be driven by the wealthier population, with
higher levels of education (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 2005). In
the short term, this dynamic usually increases income inequality between the richest and poorest
families, since the dependency ratio of the former group reduces faster (Almas, et al., 2011).
However, when these changes are followed by the poorest social segments, it may contribute to
reduce poverty and to attenuate income inequality. In the long run, despite the heterogeneity of
effects between different social groups, when the demographic transition attains the high stages
observed in the developed nations, the benefits tend to be positive for all the social segments
(Bloom et al., 2010).
        Brazil provides a rich reference to analyze the impacts of demographic changes on income
distribution. In this country, demographic changes have occurred in a relatively short period, at the
same time that the country witnessed a substantial reduction in its high levels of poverty and
inequality. According to Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (2012), the Brazilian fertility
rate dropped from 4.3 children per woman in 1981 to 1.7 in 2011. Moreover, the poverty rate was
significantly reduced from 33% to 7% in the same period, as well as the differences between the per
capita income of the poorest and richest families, both within and between rural and urban areas
(Maia & Buainain, 2011).
       This paper analyzes the impacts of changes in the family structure on the income distribution
in Brazil between 1981 and 2011. More specifically, the paper evaluates how changes in the
composition of the family structure within the richest and poorest family groups contributed to
increase per capita income, and to reduce poverty and inequality. We provide a comparison between
rural and urban areas in order to understand how these dynamics had different impacts on more
developed (urban) and less developed (rural) areas. The dynamics of the income distribution is also
analyzed according to the source of income, providing additional elements to understand how the
family types were benefited by different socioeconomic factors (labor market, pensions and other
sources) in the last decades.
        Results highlight that, besides increasing per capita income, the faster dynamics of
demographic changes among the wealthiest families contributed, per se, to increase inequality
between more developed and less developed regions, as well as between the poorest and richest
families within these regions. The overall impact on poverty reduction was insignificant. Analyses
are based on a comprehensive methodology of decomposition that allow us to estimate the specific
contribution of changes in the family structure of the richest and poorest families on the variation of
per capita income, poverty and inequality. The paper uses a detailed categorization of the family
structure that considers both differences in the family relations and fertility rates.



1. Literature review

1.1. Family structure and income inequality

                                                  1
        Among the components of demographic changes affecting income distribution, family
structure plays a central role as a mechanism for the reproduction of inequalities (McLanahan &
Percheski, 2008). Family experiences are associated with the opportunities that their members
encounter in the economy and in the labor market, which may vary considerably across social
groups and family types. Moreover, since children’s life chances are strongly influenced by family
experiences, changes in the family structure tend to affect both inequality and intergenerational
mobility (Parson, 1949).
        Studies have highlighted the rise of single-headed families, especially single-mothers, and
its implication on income distribution (Martin, 2006). Besides putting additional individuals at risk
of poverty, the fast growth of female-headed families among the most vulnerable social groups has
also played an important role in reproducing and increasing inequalities in developed nations
(Ellwood & Jencks, 2004). Single-mothers are the only potential earner in the household and tend to
be subjected to lower hourly wages than men and their married women counterparts (Cancian &
Reed, 2001). Moreover, children living far from a biological parent are more likely to live in
poverty, which will probably affect their future expectancies and ability to move up the income
ladder (McLanahan & Percheski, 2008).
         But the growth of single-mother families is not the only important demographic change in
the family structure. Cohabitation, decline in marriage, increases in divorce, non-marital
childbearing, delays in the marrying age, and late pregnancy resulted in a diversity of new forms of
family living arrangements (Martin, 2006; Cancian & Reed, 2001). Changes in the relationships
between family members, especially women’s empowerment, are crucial to understand changes
occurred in recent decades (Lesthaeghe, 1995). Results suggest a loss of centrality of the marriage
in the family formation (dissociation between marriage and reproduction), as well as the emergence
and dissemination of new types of families. There is a growing number of single parent families and
the so-called beanpole families (characterized by a small number of family members in each
generation, they are "long" and "thin"). These changes are related to several factors, such as the
fertility reduction, late motherhood, high longevity, increasing number of divorces, and increasing
number of stepchildren (new families with children from past marriages).
        The impacts of these and other important demographic changes, such as fertility reduction
and population aging, have been analyzed between the richest and the poorest countries (Hausmann
& Székely, 2001), as well as between the richest and poorest families within these countries (Bloom
et al. 2010). First, the rise of the single-parent and other economically vulnerable family types tend
to place upward pressure on poverty rates (Iceland, 2003). On the other hand, the growth of
cohabitation, women employment and the overall fertility decline acted conversely, restraining the
rise in poverty (Cancian & Reed, 2001). Moreover, changes in the distribution of these family types
among the social groups also affected income inequality. For instance, the income of cohabitating
families has shown itself to be more equally distributed in relation to the income of nuclear and
single-headed families (Martin, 2006). Additionally, the faster reduction in the number of children
born among the more affluent families can contribute to increase inequality. Income inequality can
also rise if families become increasingly divided into groups with one earner and groups with two
earners (Lerman, 1996).

1.2. Social and demographic trends in Brazil

        In recent decades, Brazil witnessed pronounced demographic changes in addition to
substantial socioeconomic improvements. In the 1980s, the number of children per woman fell
dramatically, even among the poorest families (Cariello, 2013). In the 1990s, the absolute number
of children stopped growing for the first time, as a result of the falling fertility witnessed one decade
before. The fertility rate continued dropping in the 2000s: from 2.2 children per woman in 2002 to
1.7 in 2011 (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada, 2012). The differences between income
                                                   2
strata also reduced considerably. In 1992, the richest 20% had a fertility rate of 1.4 per woman and
the poorest had 4.7; in 2011 these rates reduced to 0.9, and 3.6, respectively. In other words, the
ratio of the number of children per woman between these groups reduced from 3.3 to 2.7. In a
relatively short period, the Brazilian richest women are now experiencing extremely low fertility
rates, comparable to those observed in developed countries like Italy, Spain, and Japan. The country
also has a high aging population, caused by both a great decline in fertility and a fast increase in life
expectancy.
        Simultaneously, Brazil experienced significant changes in their living conditions, especially
in the years 2000. After a long period of economic instability in the 1980s and early 1990s, poverty
and income inequality have been reduced considerably since mid-90s (Barros, et al., 2011). Many
factors have been pointed as central determinants of such socioeconomic improvements. The
country was specially benefited by the increasing prices of commodities and growing exports in the
2000s, boosting economic growth and socioeconomic improvements. Moreover, institutional factors
also contributed to attenuate poverty and inequality, such as income cash transfer programs (Bolsa
Família) and rural pensions (Maia & Buainain, 2011). Non-labor income has risen faster than labor
income over the past decades, especially in rural areas. As a result, in spite of the fact that rural
areas in Brazil are historically characterized by poor living conditions, poverty reduced faster in
these areas, as well as the urban-rural inequality.
       The family structure in Brazil has also changed progressively since the 1980s (Leone, et al.,
2010). The most significant changes were related to an increasing share of single head units,
couples without children, and single mothers with children. On the other hand, the share of nuclear
and extended families (those characterized by diverse generations living together) reduced
substantially. Now the elderly also have a higher empowerment in the households, as a consequence
of social program targeted to this population, such as the Benefício de Prestação Continuada
program and the rural pension (Beltrão, et al., 2005). Moreover, cash transfer programs, such as
Bolsa Familia, also contributed to attenuate socioeconomic conditions of the more vulnerable
family groups, reducing poverty and inequality



2. Materials and Methods

        Analyses are based on data of the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD)
from 1981 to 2011, provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). PNAD
is a cross-sectional survey applied annually and is nationally representative of the Brazilian
territory, with the slight exception of a few remote rural areas in six northern states, which
represented less than 3% of the Brazilian population in 2000 (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estatística, 1995)1. The long period of analysis, 30 years, and the huge changes witnessed in the
period attenuate potential noises generated by annual fluctuation in the relation between
demographic changes and income distribution.
         The categorization of the family structure considers both differences in the family relations
(single-headed, couples and extended families) and differences in the fertility rate, expressed by the
number and age of the children. As a result, ten types of families were considered: i) single male
unit; ii) single female unit; iii) couple without children; iv) couple with children under 14; v) couple
with (at least one) children 14 or older; vi) single mother with children under 14; vii) single mother
with (at least one) children 14 or older; viii) single father with children under 14; ix) single father

  PNAD excludes the rural areas of the states of Rondônia, Acre, Amazonas, Roraima, Pará and Amapá. Since 2004,
these areas were added to the PNAD sampling survey. However, in order to maintain historical comparability, those
areas were not considered in this study.

with (at least one) children 14 or older; x) extended family2. People living in collective households
and those live-in domestic workers with their relatives were excluded in our analysis.
        We compared the impacts of changes in the family structure on the per capita income of the
10% richest and the 40% poorest families. We also considered differences between urban and rural
areas in order to analyze in what extend such changes affected differently the income distribution in
more developed (urban) and less developed (rural) areas.

Decomposing variation in the per capita income

        In order to evaluate the impacts of changes in the family structure on the dynamics of the
income distribution, we first decomposed the variation in the per capita family income (PCFI) in
two sources: (i) changes in the participation of the types of families (composition effect, CE); and
(ii) changes in the per capita income of each type of family (within effect, WE). Supposes, initially,
 Y as the variation in the PCFI between periods         and . This variation can be represented by
the weighted sum of the variation witnessed in each type of family:
                  k
          Y   ( p g Yg )                                                             (1)
                 g 1

      Where p g is the proportion of the g-th type of family and Yg is its respective PCFI.
Making some adjustments, expression (1) can be rewritten as:
                  k


                 g 1

                                                       
          Y   p g (Y g  Y )  p g Yg   CE g  WE g
                                                g 1
                                                                                        (2)


          Where p g is the average share of the g-th type of family in periods             and , Y g is the
respective average PCFI for this type of family, and Y the average PCFI for all families in the
same periods. The first term in expression (2), CE, represents the composition effect, i.e., the share
of the variation in the PCFI due to changes in the relative participation of the g-th type of family. In
turn, the second term WE represents the within effect and expresses the share of the variation in the
PCFI due to changes in the PCFI of the g-th type of family.
       We computed this decomposition for the whole population, for the 10% richest and the 40%
poorest families, as well as for the urban and rural families. This analysis allows inferring, for
example, if the monetary gains of each social group were due to changes in the family structures or
due to the income dynamics itself. The greater the value of the CE, the greater is the impact of
changes in the family structure on the income variation for the respective social group.

Decomposing variation in the poverty rate

        First, we defined poverty rate as the ratio between the population living on less than $2.00 a
day at international prices (R$ 3.6 per day in 2011) and the whole population. We then used similar
procedures to decompose the variation in the poverty rate (PR) in two sources: (i) changes in the
participation of the types of families (composition effect on poverty, CEP); and (ii) changes in the
poverty rate of each type of family (within effect on poverty, WEP). The variation in the poverty
rate between periods         and can be represented by the weighted sum of the variation witnessed
in each type of family:

    The extended family is composed by different types of relatives and/or aggregates.

       Where PR g is the average poverty rate of the g-th type of family in periods                         and , and
PR is the average poverty rate for all families in the same periods. The first term in expression (4),
CEP, represents the composition effect on poverty, i.e., the share of the variation in the poverty rate
due to changes in the relative participation of the g-th type of family. In turn, the second term WEP
represents the within effect on poverty and expresses the share of the variation in the poverty rate
due to changes in the poverty of the g-th type of family.

Decomposing variation in the inequality rate

       Finally, we evaluate the impacts of changes in the composition of the family structure on the
inequality variation. Analyses are based on the inequality ratio (IR), a ratio between the PCFI of the
10% richest and the 40% richest families:

               Y

       Where Y is the PCFI of the 10% richest families and Y is the PCFI of the 40% poorest
families. In turn, the variation in the IR between periods and can be represented by:

        In other words, the variation in the inequality ratio depends both on the composition effects
(CE10 and CE40) and within effects (WE10 and WE40) of the richest 10% and the poorest 40%
families. Now, making counterfactual simulations, we can estimate the direct impact of two main
sources of variation on the IR: (i) changes in the participation of the types of families (composition
effect on inequality, CEI); and (ii) changes within each type of family (within effect on inequality,
WEI):

        The CEI (expression 9) represents the expected variation in the IR if changes in the PCFI of
the 10% richest and the 40% poorest families were restricted to the composition effect, i.e., changes
in the family structure. In turn, the WEI in (expression 10) represents the expected variation in the
IR if changes in the PCFI were restricted to the within effect, i.e., changes in the PCFI within the
family types. Since the variation in the IR (expression 6) does not allow a simple linear
decomposition between CEI and WEI, we have also to consider the interaction effect on inequality
(IEI), this means, changes that depend simultaneously on the variation of the CE and the WE and
cannot be linearly decomposed. Thus, the total variation in the IR will be given by:
       IR  CEI  WEI  IEI                                                      (11)
        Finally, we investigated the composition of PCFI. Three types of income source were
considered: work (income from all jobs); retirement (government sponsored or private pension
plans, and income from permanence allowance) and other sources (income from donations, rentals,
investments, social programs, and so on).


3. Results

3.1. Family Structure

         Table 1 shows the income distribution in urban areas according to the type of family and
income stratum between 1981 and 2011. Similar results are presented to rural families in Table 2.
First, results highlight the fast growth of the urban population (72.8 million people between 1981
and 2011) and the sharp decrease of the rural population (9.5 million people in the same period).
Unlike the demographic dynamics in developed countries, the transition from rural to urban
population occurred in a relatively short period in Brazil. According to Tafner (2006), more than 24
million people moved from rural to urban areas between the 1980s and the 1990s.
        In 2011, the main differences between family structures in urban and rural areas were, first,
the higher share of traditional nuclear families in the rural areas (51% of couples with children in
urban areas and 58% in rural areas). On the other hand, single female units and single mothers with
children were more frequent in urban areas (14% of single female heads in urban areas and 8% in
rural areas). Independent of the types of family, differences between PCFI are expressive. The ratio
between urban and rural PCFI varies between 1.7 (for single fathers) and 2.5 (for couples with
children). Overall, the average PCFI is 2.1 higher in urban areas.
         The main change observed between 1981 and 2011 was the sharp decrease of the share of
nuclear families, especially couples with children under 14 (a drop of 9 percentage points in the
urban areas and 8 percentage points in the rural areas). Despite this reduction, couples with children
still accounted for more than half of the Brazilian population in 2011. On the other hand, the share

of couples without children more than doubled in urban areas (from 5.1% in 1981 to 10.7% in
2011) and almost tripled in rural areas (from 3.8% in 1981 to 11.5% in 2011).

       These changes were observed in all strata, but with greater intensity among the richest ones.
Among the 10% richest families, for example, the share of couples with children under 14
decreased by 13 percentage points in both urban and rural areas (among the 40% poorest families, it
decreased by just 4 and 5 percentage points for urban and rural areas, respectively). Meanwhile, the
share of couples without children increased by 9 percentage points in urban areas and by 19
percentage points in rural areas among the 10% richest families (it increased by just 2 percentage
points among the 40% poorest in both urban and rural areas). This latter arrangement tends to have

                                                                      8
higher levels of income in comparison with other nuclear families, except among the poorest rural
families, where children usually contribute to the familiar agricultural production.
       Other important change was the increasing share of single heads with or without children.
Single mother with children under 14 is the most vulnerable group and grew especially among the
poorest families, in urban and rural areas (5 and 4 percentage points among the 40% poorest
families in urban and rural areas, respectively). Among the richest families, both single male and
female units increased substantially, and they present the highest PCFI among all types of family.
        Extended families represent another expressive group in the family structure, especially
among the poorest urban families (22% in 2011). The dynamic of the family structure also indicate
an increasing representativeness of this group among the most vulnerable families (4 percentage
points in urban areas and 2 percentage points in rural areas) and decreasing participation among the
richest group (4 percentage points in urban areas and 3 percentage point in rural areas). Among the
poorest families, this type of family with distant relatives and aggregates may indicate a strategic
defense, i.e., the need for sharing resources among family members. As a result, it presents one of
the lowest levels of poverty among urban and rural families (Table 3).
       PCFI grew and poverty reduced substantially between 1981 and 2011 for most types of
families. This dynamics was more expressive in rural areas, reducing differences between less and
more developed regions in Brazil. For example, average PCFI increased by 95% in rural areas and
by 38% in urban areas. As a result, the ratio between the urban and rural PCFI reduced by 29%,
from 3 to 2.1. In the same time, poverty reduced by 50 percentage points in rural areas and 24
percentage points in urban areas.
        In turn, inequality showed had opposite trends within less and more developed areas in
Brazil. Since PCFI grew faster among the poorest families in the urban areas, the ratio between the
PCFI of the 10% richest and the 40% poorest families reduced from 18.3 to 14.9. On the other hand,
since PCFI grew faster among the richest in the rural areas, inequality ratio increased from 13 to
13.6. As a consequence of these divergent dynamics, the high levels of urban inequality were
comparable with those of the rural areas in 2011.

        Finally, it is also worth highlighting the high levels of inequality among the single head
units. Although single male and single female units are characterized by high levels of PCFI and
low levels of poverty, they present the highest levels of inequality in both urban and rural areas.

3.2. The impacts of changing family structure

        We now analyze the impacts of changes in the distribution of the type of family on the total
PCFI variation (total effect, TE) between 1981 and 2011 (equation 2). Analyses allowed us
identifying the contribution of changes in the family structure (composition effect, CE) and changes
in the PCFI of each type of family (income effect, IE) on the PCFI variation (Tables 3 and 4).
Besides decomposing the income variation for the total urban and rural areas, we also performed
separated analyses for each stratum: the richest 10% and poorest 40%.
        Overall, changes in the family structure had a positive impact on the income variation. The
impact was higher in urban areas, where R$ 52.9 of the total R$ 228.5 variation in the PCFI (23%)
were due to the CE, i.e., due to changes in the composition of the types of family. The impact on
rural areas was lower but still positive: R$ 32.1 of the total R$ 186.7 variation in the PCFI were due
to the CE.
        These positive impacts were especially due to increasing participation of the less vulnerable
groups, such as single male and female units, and couples without children. For instance, the
increasing participation of couples without children contributed with 13% to the total variation in
the PCFI in urban areas and with 10% in rural areas. The increasing participation of single males
and females also contributed with 10% to the total variation in the PCFI in the urban areas and with
4% in the rural areas. Moreover, the reducing participation of couples with children under 14, group
with low PCFI, also contributed positively to the income variation: 4% in urban areas and 3% in
rural areas. On the other hand, the tenuous growing participation of single mothers with children
under 14, the most vulnerable group, resulted in the most expressive negative impact in the PCFI
variation: –2% in the urban areas and –1% in the rural areas.
        The CE was larger among the richest 10% families, accounting for 18.5% of the total PCFI
growth in urban areas and 7.5% in rural areas. Similarly to the dynamic observed in the whole
population, this positive effect was especially due to increasing participation of single male and
female units, and couples without children, as well as to the reducing participation of couples with
children under 14. On the other hand, changes in the family structure of the poorest families had a
negative impact on the PCFI variation: –2% in the urban areas and –3.5% in the rural areas. These
negative results were especially due to the increasing participation of the most vulnerable family
type: single mother with children under 14.

       The overall impact of changing family structure on poverty alleviation in Brazil was almost
inexpressive (Table 6). The negative effects of the increasing participation of less vulnerable groups
on poverty variation, such as couple without children and single head units, were partly offset by
the increasing participation of single mothers. Overall, changes in the share of the family types
contributed with less than 1 percentage point to reduce poverty in urban areas and with less than 3
percentage points in rural areas. Thus, the expressive poverty reduction witnessed in Brazil between
1981 and 2011 was especially due to changes observed within these types of families.

         Moreover, since the effect of changing family structure on the PCFI was higher among the
richest families, it contributed to increase inequality in both urban and rural areas. Table 7 presents
the counterfactual simulation of the impact of changes in the family structure on IR and highlights
that, if the variation in the PCFI was exclusively due to changes in the composition of the types of
families (CE), the ratio between the PCFI of the richest 10% and the 40% poorest families would
have increased by 1 point between 1981 and 2011. In urban areas this impact was counterbalanced
by the faster growth of the PCFI within poorest families, and IR decreased by 3.5 points. In the
rural areas, the overall result was an IR 0.6 point higher in comparison with 1981.

3.3. Sources of Income
        We now analyze the distribution of income according to three sources: labor, pensions and
others (Figures 1 and 2). Despite a pronounced reduction in the share of the labor income between
1981 and 2011, it still represents the most important source among urban and rural families. The
reduction was greater in rural areas, as a result of the intensification of target social programs to
combat rural poverty (Maia & Buainain, 2011). The share of labor income reduced from 85% to
78% in urban areas and from 91% to 66% in rural areas. On the other hand, the share of pension
incomes grew from 10% to 19% in urban areas and from 6% to 28% in rural areas. The share of
other sources of incomes, which include cash transfer programs (Bolsa Família), grew just in rural
areas: from 3% to 7%.
        In 2011, labor income was more relevant in urban areas, with no expressive difference
between the poorest (78% of the total income) and the richest strata (79%). This source of income is
especially associated with couples with children and father with young children, which may suggest
a higher availability of the family members to offer work. In rural areas, the participation of the
labor income was higher among the richest families, since the poorest rural families depended more
intensively on income from social programs (others sources).

        The participation of pensions in the PCFI grew especially among the richest families. The
share of this source of income grew from 10% to 19% among the 10% richest in urban areas and
from 4% to 24% in rural areas. The minimum value paid for benefit is based on the value of the
minimum wage in Brazil. Since this value increased substantially in last decades, pension has been
pointed as a fundamental determinant of the poverty alleviation in Brazil (Maia, 2010). Pensions are
specially related to single female, single mother or father with older children and extended families.
The high dependence among single head units is probably related to retired widows and widowers.
In turn, the dependence among extended families may probably indicate a trend of many family
members to live with their retired relatives as a strategic defense against poverty.
        While pensions grew faster among the richest families and, thus, may have contributed to
increase inequality, the other sources of income, which also include cash transfer programs, grew
faster among the poorest families. This source of income is especially important among the rural
poor families, for whom it represented 24% of the total PCFI in 2011. It represented near 50% of
                                                       15

4. Final considerations

        Brazil has a huge income inequality, one of the largest in the world, and a low level of per
capita income. Between 1981 and 2011, this country witnessed substantial changes in its family
structure, with relevant impacts on income distribution. The average family size declined from 5.0
in 1981 to 3.4 in 2011, in part because fertility decreased but also due to changes in the family
structure. The share of traditional nuclear families reduced sharply, increasing the participation of
couples without children and single-headed families. The increasing share of extended families with
several primary income earners is also noticeable, characterizing the process of population
transition of developing countries that have occurred in a short period of time (Chu & Jiang, 1997).
        The sharp decrease of nuclear families and the rise of couples without children in both rural
and urban areas reflect mostly a sharp decline in the fertility rates. In rural areas, we have also to
consider the migration of many young members from rural to urban areas, in search of better job
opportunities. Overall, changes in the family structure contributed significantly to the income
dynamics among rural and urban families. First, the reduced number of dependent children had
clearly a positive impact on per capita income. However, this positive contribution (i) was greater in
urban areas, and (ii) was restricted to the higher income strata. Among the poorest families, changes
in the family structure had a negative effect on the income distribution, contributing to reduce
average per capita income and to increase inequality within urban and rural areas. Similarly to what
happened in developed nations (see, for instance, McLanahan & Percheski, 2008; Martin, 2006;
Lerman, 1996; Karoly & Burtless, 1995), the fast increase of single-headed families in the bottom
strata, especially single-mother families, subjecting an increasing share of families to low hourly
wages and to the risk of poverty.
        Poverty rates continue to be substantially high among single-mother families, which
contributed to attenuate the positive impact of the increasing number of couples without children on
poverty reduction in Brazil. The overall impact of changing family structure on poverty was almost
inexpressive, in both urban and rural areas. High income inequality within each family group also
helps to explain why the positive impact that changing family structure had on PCFI did not reflect
more significantly in poverty alleviation. The average PCFI of the 10% richest families is more than
10 times higher than the PCFI of the 40% poorest families for all family types, especially those
formed by single-headed units. Inequality is lower within extended families, since sharing the
household with additional earners provides economies of scale and helps to attenuate the
socioeconomic condition of many traditional families in vulnerable conditions.
        Changes in the family structure were more pronounced in urban areas, contributing to
increase inequality between more developed and less developed areas. The lower impact of the
demographic changes on the poorest and on the less developed areas gives rise to two main
hypotheses: i) the richest population would be the main beneficiary of the demographic changes
(i.e., being favored by the higher education levels and consequently by the more pronounced
reduction in the fertility rate), ii) the intergenerational mobility of the families, where demographic
changes observed in the transition between the generations within the families would remove these
poor families from the lower tenths of the income strata. Unfortunately, the second hypothesis
cannot be investigated more accurately, since there is no longitudinal data available in Brazil to
analyze family mobility. Nevertheless, the demographic changes that have occurred among the
poorest families in Brazil are noticeable (IPEA, 2012). A direct consequence of the fertility
reduction among the poorest families would be the reduction of the dependency ratio and growth of
the PCFI, resulting in many poor families leaving the lower tenths of the income strata.
                                                     16
        Despite the negative contribution of the demographic changes to the income differences
between urban and rural families, the income inequality between these areas reduced significantly
in this period. The income growth of the poorest families arose from a broad variety of sources,
such as higher wages, labor-force participation, pension and cash transfer programs (Barros, et al.,
2007). All sources of income (labor, pension, and others) grew faster in rural areas, contributing to
reduce urban-rural inequality. First, it is worth highlighting recent improvements in the Brazilian
labor market, as a result of higher rates of formalization and new labor regulations (increasing
minimum wage) (Sakamoto & Maia, 2012). The poorest segments were especially benefited, since
the Brazilian minimum wage grew faster than the average wage (Saboia, 2010). Retirement are the
second most important source of income and increased substantially for both urban areas and
especially rural areas. Moreover, several modifications implemented in the Federal Constitution of
1988 greatly benefited the rural population, such as less restrictive conditions for granting the
benefits, and the reduction of the minimum age to start collecting the benefits (Beltrão, et al., 2005).
Finally, cash transfer programs implemented since the mid-1990s clearly contributed to improve
socioeconomic conditions of the poorest family, particularly in rural areas (Maia & Buainain,
2011). In the short term, these social policies showed positive impacts on the income distribution.
       Finally, it is worth noting that our results do not represent causal relationships. In other
words, we cannot definitively say that poverty is caused by changes in family structure (Iceland,
2003). Nevertheless, results highlight that a significant share of the population in Brazil has not yet
benefited from the changes in the family structure. When considered alone, these changes
demonstrated regressive effects and have increased the income inequality in Brazil. However, the
poorest families seem to have especially benefited from the economic growth experienced in Brazil
in recent years, which contributed considerably to increase income and to reduce the levels of
inequality and poverty in Brazil.
