Resumo. Este artigo apresenta uma alternativa à estimação univariada clássica da equação minceriana, pro-
pondo a estimação de regressões bivariadas para rendimento e horas trabalhadas. A modelagem inclui covar-
iáveis tanto comuns quanto específicas para o vetor bivariado de variáveis dependentes. As estimações usam
dados extraídos da Pesquisa Nacional por Amostras de Domicílio (PNAD) no período de 2013 a 2015. Dentre
as distribuições utilizadas, os critérios de informação e a distância Mahalanobis indicaram que a distribuição
t foi a que melhor se ajustou aos dados, tanto para modelos univariados quanto bivariados. Dentre as vanta-
gens da regressão bivariada estão a modelagem com estrutura de correlação entre as variáveis dependentes, a
identificação de efeitos antagônicos oriundos de covariáveis comuns sobre rendimento e horas trabalhadas e a
flexibilidade para se assumir distintas distribuições bivariadas. Dentre os resultados obtidos, destaca-se que as
covariáveis representativas de educação, tipo de contrato de trabalho e localização geográfica, na regressão
bivariada, apresentaram sinais e magnitudes diferentes para rendimento e horas trabalhadas. Assim, o uso da
modelagem bivariada surge como uma importante alternativa àquela tradicionalmente utilizada na estimação
da equação minceriana de rendimento.

Abstract. This paper proposes the estimation of bivariate regressions for earnings and hours worked as an
alternative to the classical univariate estimation of the Mincerian earnings equation. The estimated models in-
clude both common and specific covariates for the bivariate vector of dependent variables and use data for the
Brazilian economy extracted from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) from 2013 to 2015. Among
the distributions used, the information criteria and Mahalanobis distance indicated that the Student t distri-
bution produced the best fit to the data, for both univariate and bivariate cases. Advantages of the bivariate
regression include estimation with a correlation structure between the dependent variables, identification of
antagonistic effects from common covariates on earnings and hours worked, and flexibility to assume differ-
ent bivariate distributions. The results indicate that there is a positive and statistically significant correlation
between earnings and hours worked. In addition, the covariates education, type of employment contract, and
geographical location presented different signals and magnitudes for the estimated coefficients by the bivariate
regression for earnings and hours worked. Thus, the bivariate approach emerges as an important alternative
to the univariate estimation that is traditionally applied for the Mincerian earnings equation.

1     Introduction
    The Mincerian earnings equation introduced by Mincer (1974) is the basis of a broad empirical
literature on labor economics, including contributions by Senna (1976), Willis and Rosen (1979),
Cain (1986), Garen (1984), Robinson and Tomes (1984), Blackburn and Neumark (1993), Weisberg
(1995), and Card (1999). These studies generally seek to estimate the returns to education and expe-
rience on the earnings-hour received by the worker. Originally, Mincer proposed that the distribution
of earnings of workers among their different occupations is positively related to the amount of invest-
ment made in human capital, which has an impact on productivity and economic growth.1
    Initially, the Mincerian earnings equation was structured by a linear regression in which the earnings-
hour variable is explained by schooling and experience. Following the model proposed by Mincer
(1974), other explanatory variables were incorporated into the regression, such as individual charac-
teristics of gender and race that are used to assess the presence of discrimination in the labor market.
In Cain (1986), the model was expanded to incorporate other individual characteristics, such as mari-
tal status and region of residence, to capture regional effects on wage differentials.
    When deciding to join the labor market, a worker chooses the number of hours that he will make
available to the market. Sedlacek and Santos (1991) used data from the Brazilian National Household
Sample Survey (PNAD) and analyzed the relationship between the husband’s income and the labor
supply by their female spouses. They observed that the higher the husband’s income, the higher the
reservation wage and the less likely their wives will work. Moreover, the younger and more children
the family has, the less likely they are to join the labor market or, when they do, they offer fewer hours
of work.
    As far as estimation methods are concerned, since Mincer (1974), the literature has used the tra-
ditional ordinary least squares (OLS) method and its variants with instrumental variables, quantile
regression, sample selection, and procedures based on maximum likelihood estimation [Chatterjee
and Price (1991), Stapleton (1995), Heckman (1974), Heckman (1976), Heckman (1979), Garen
(1984), Buchinsky (2001)]. In Brazil, the greater availability of microdata and the improvement of the
computational capacity contributed to the expansion of the empirical evidence since 2000, highlight-
ing Maciel et al. (2001), Sachcida et al. (2004), Menezes-Filho (2002), Giuberti and Menezes-Filho
(2005), Madalozzo (2010).
    A common factor in the literature is the use of earnings-hour as the dependent variable in the
Mincerian equation. This variable, in general, is obtained by the simple division of the income earned
by the hours worked in the period. Such an approach, however, implies the agglutination, in a single
variable, of two distinct components, represented by earnings and hours worked, which should be
modeled separately. The determinants of income, which appear in the Mincerian equation, and of
labor supply, which affect the decision to participate in the labor market, are not necessarily the same,
in either quantitative (magnitudes) or qualitative (signals) terms.
    Hours worked and wage income have distinct determinants, a feature that is not captured by tra-
ditional estimates of the Mincerian equation that uses hourly wage as the dependent variable. The
stock of human capital, measured by formal education and experience, for instance, tends to increase
the workers’ remuneration, but may also reduce the willingness to offer working hours in the labor
market. Those who are more qualified might receive higher remuneration by working less hours than
    1
      Human capital is understood as the set of attributes acquired by a worker through education, skill, and experience
that favor work and production. This term was introduced by Mincer (1958) and later explored by Becker (1993) and
Heckman et al. (2000), among others.

those who are less qualified. These antagonistic effects of education on wages and hours worked are
not captured by the univariate estimates of the Mincerian earnings equation.
   Therefore, there is a gap in the literature that this study seeks to fill. The common practice of using
the earnings-hour dependent variable might hide the effects of covariates that would be distinct if
separately assessed on wage and hours worked. In contrast to the classical approach, this paper aims
to estimate a bivariate regression for the Mincerian equation considering earnings and hours worked
as a bivariate vector of dependent variables. The regressions include both common and specific
covariates for the bivariate vector of earnings and hours worked. The bivariate Normal, Student t,
and Birnbaum-Saunders (BS)2 distributions are used in the estimation. For the sake of comparison,
the univariate Mincerian earnings equation will also be estimated, considering a single dependent
variable represented by earnings per hour worked. Estimates will be made for the Brazilian economy
using data extracted from the PNAD from 2013 to 2015.
   Advantages of the bivariate regression approach include the possibility of modeling a correlation
structure among the dependent variables. If there is a correlation, the estimation of univariate regres-
sions separately for earnings and hours worked might provide biased results [Marchant et al. (2016)].
The bivariate framework allows to identify antagonistic effects of common covariates on the differ-
ent dependent variables. Finally, there is flexibility to assume different bivariate distributions for the
earnings and hours-worked model. As in Heckman (1976), the parameters will be estimated by maxi-
mum likelihood, which is efficient according to Mittelhammer et al. (2000). Thus, the bivariate model
emerges as an important alternative to the univariate one that is traditionally used in the literature for
the estimation of the Mincerian earnings equation.
   The results indicate that some common explanatory variables have different signals and magnitudes
of the estimated coefficients in the bivariate regression of earnings and hours-worked. Specifically,
the estimated coefficients for education, type of employment contract, and geographical location have
distinct signals and different magnitudes for earnings and hours-worked regressions. Considering
education, for instance, more years in school imply in higher average wage and lower supply of hours
in the labor market. In the univariate regression, however, only the positive impact of an additional
year of study on the earnings per hour is observed. Furthermore, the bivariate model captures the
correlation between the two dependent variables, which implies in a more robust estimation than
separate univariate regressions. There are, therefore, important advantages associated to the bivariate
approach when compared to the univariate regression, suggesting that the former is more suitable for
the estimation of the Mincerian earnings equation.
   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical model, presents the database,
reports, and discusses the results. Finally, the third section presents the concluding remarks.


2        Empirical approach
2.1        Empirical model
    The Mincerian earnings equation is typically described by the following univariate regression:

                                                    log(w) = Xγ + ,                                                      (1)
    2
        See Johnson et al. (1995), Balakrishnan and Lai (2009), Santos-Neto et al. (2012) and Saulo et al. (2018, 2019)



                                                               3
where log(w) is a vector with the logarithm of the wage per hour (dependent variable), γ is a vector
of coefficients, X is a matrix of explanatory variables, such as schooling, experience, race, gender
and others, and  is a random error vector. It is usually assumed that the error follows a normal
distribution and the earnings per hour is calculated as:

                     earnings-hour = monthly earnings/(hours worked × 4.33).

   The differential of the present paper is to model the earnings equation (1) as a bivariate regres-
sion of earnings and hours worked separately in order to capture different effects of the explanatory
variables on wages and labor supply. Furthermore, as earnings and hours worked are correlated, the
bivariate regression is more appropriate than the univariate estimation of separate regressions.
   In the bivariate environment, the model can be estimated as a vector of dependent variables
Yi = (Y1i , Y2i )> , where Y1i is the wage in the main job and Y2i represents the hours dedicated to
the main job by each individual i. This vector might be modeled as a set x of explanatory variables
by using one of the three bivariate distributions described in the Appendix with the respective sets of
equations such that:

i) Bivariate Normal distribution:

                          E[log(Y1i )|Xi = xi ] = µ1i = x>
                                                         i β1 ,       i = 1, . . . , n,
                          E[log(Y2i )|Xi = xi ] = µ2i =     x>
                                                             i β2 ,   i = 1, . . . , n;               (2)

ii) Bivariate t distribution:

                          E[log(Y1i )|Xi = xi ] = µ1i = x>
                                                         i β1 ,       i = 1, . . . , n,
                          E[log(Y2i )|Xi = xi ] = µ2i =     x>
                                                             i β2 ,   i = 1, . . . , n;               (3)

iii) Bivariate BS distribution:

                           E[Y1i |Xi = xi ] = µ1i = exp(x>
                                                         i β1 ), i = 1, . . . , n,
                           E[Y1i |Xi = xi ] = µ2i = exp(x>
                                                         i β2 ), i = 1, . . . , n.                    (4)


   Note that in the Normal and t cases, we assume that the dependent variables have bivariate log-
normal and log-t distributions, which implies that the logarithm of the variables provides the Normal
and t bivariate distributions, respectively [Vanegas and Paula (2016)]. For the bivariate BS distri-
bution, it is not necessary to apply the logarithm due to the parameterization as a function of the
averages of this distribution [Saulo et al. (2018, 2019)]. Based on the literature, we defined the set of
covariates used in the regression estimations [Borjas (2012)]. We separated the covariates that affect
both earnings and hours worked simultaneously from those that affect only one of these variables.
   The common covariates, which affect both earnings and hours worked, are:

   • Gender: is a dummy variable that assumes value 1 for men and 0 for women;
   • Race: is a dummy variable that assumes value 1 for caucasians and 0 for non-caucasians;
   • Marital status: is a dummy variable that assumes value 1 for married individuals and 0 for
     unmarried individuals;

                                                        4
    • Age and Age2 : represent the age of the individual and its square, usually used as a proxy for
      experience;

    • Education: this variable has as a proxy the formal years of study, ranging from 0 to 16 years;

    • Category (high, high mean, mean, low mean, low): set of binary variables used to capture oc-
      cupancy category, segmented according to socioeconomic criteria and having the low category
      as a reference 3 ;

    • Employment contract (with an employment record card, with no employment record card, au-
      tonomous, civil servant): the variables "no employment record card", "autonomous" and "civil
      servant" are dummies that seek to capture the type of occupation of the individual in the labor
      market, having "individuals with an employment record card" as the base category;

    • Metropolitan region (Belém-PA, Fortaleza-CE, Recife-PE, Salvador-BA, Belo Horizonte- MG,
      Rio de Janeiro-RJ, Curitiba-PR, Porto Alegre-RS, Brasília-DF and São Paulo-SP): set of binary
      variables that designate the metropolitan regions of residence of the individuals in the sample,
      taking São Paulo as the base category;

    • Year (2013, 2014, and 2015): are time dummy variables for the years of the sample, having
      2013 as the base year;

    • Sector (agriculture, industry, construction, trade, food and others, education, health, and social
      services): dummy variables that seek to capture cluster effects by sector of activities of the
      individuals, having as reference individuals working in the public sector.

The covariates that affect only the earnings are:

    • Trade Union: dummy variable that assumes value 1 for individuals who were associated with
      some trade union in the reference month and 0 for those who were not associated;

    • Social Security: dummy variable that assumes value 1 for individuals who were taxpayers of
      some type of social security in the reference month and 0 for those who were not taxpayers;

    • Experience: number of years in the main job, which can range from 0 to 56 years.

The covariates that affect only the hours worked are:

    • Head: dummy variable to capture the condition of the individual in the household, assuming
      value 1 if the reference individual of the household is head of the family and value 0 otherwise
      (non-head);

    • Minors: dummy variable used to capture if there are children under 10 years old in the house-
      hold;

    • Inactivity: dummy variable that assumes value 1 for households that had unemployed people in
      the reference month and 0 for those households with no unemployed.

    The database came from the PNAD in the period from 2013 to 2015. This survey is annually
collected and published by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and provides a
wide set of demographic and socioeconomic information about the Brazilian population at the indi-
vidual and household levels. Here, we consider a sample of individuals aged between 18 and 65 years
with complete information on earnings and hours worked, totalizing 167,271 observations. The data
refer to the 10 major metropolitan regions of the country, namely Belém-PA, Fortaleza-CE, Recife-PE,
Salvador- BA, Belo Horizonte-MG, Rio de Janeiro-RJ, Curitiba-PR, Porto Alegre-RS, Brasília-DF,
and São Paulo-SP. The nominal values of earnings were deflated by the National Consumer Price
Index (INPC). There is no inclusion of variables to control groups of individuals each year. Thus, the
database is characterized as a pooled cross-section. All the results were obtained by the R statistical
software [https://www.r-project.org/].
    Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics for earnings and hours worked at level and logarith-
mic scales, including sample size, minimum and maximum values, average (avg), median, standard
deviation (SD), coefficients of variation (CV), asymmetry (CA), and kurtosis (CK). These measures
indicate that earnings in level has a high asymmetry and a significant kurtosis, suggesting that a dis-
tribution with asymmetry and heavy tails is better to fit the data. On the other hand, hours worked
in level show low asymmetry and moderate kurtosis.The application of the logarithm tends to pro-
duce symmetry, especially in the case of earnings. Figure 1 shows histograms of earnings and hours
worked at level and logarithmic scales.

2.2     Investigation of the best fit
   Initially, the Normal, t, and BS univariate regression models, for earnings and hours worked, as
well as their bivariate counterparts are estimated to investigate the distribution that best fits the data
in each case. Table 2 reports the values of the Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) information criteria,
calculated as:
                           AIC = −2` + 2k and BIC = −2` + k log(n),
where ` is the value of the log-likelihood function, k denotes the number of parameters, and n indi-
cates the number of observations. These information criteria were used to select the models. Accord-
ing to Table 2, the univariate and bivariate models based on the t distribution yielded the best adjust-
ments, as they resulted in the lowest values for the AIC and BIC. Thus, among the 3 distributions,
the univariate and bivariate models of the t distribution shall be used according to the information
criteria.
    Once the best univariate and bivariate models were chosen, another evaluation of the quality of the
fit was performed by the Mahalanobis distance, as proposed by Marchant et al. (2016). In the case of

where U ∼ tBiv(µ1 , µ2 , σ1 , σ2 , ν, ρ) according to equation (14) of the Appendix, and ψ is the co-
variance matrix. According to (5), the Mahalanobis distance in the case of the bivariate t distribution
follows a F2,ν distribution. That is, F with 2 and ν degrees of freedom. In the univariate case, we
have a F1,ν . In order to obtain the values of the Mahalanobis distance, the parameters are replaced
by their maximum likelihood estimators, which results asymptotically in the same distribution in (5)
[Vilca et al. (2014)]. The Wilson-Hilferty approximation can then be applied at the Mahalanobis dis-
tance to obtain a standard approximate Normal distribution in (5). Thus, the quality of the fit of the
univariate and bivariate t regression models might be evaluated by the transformed distances with the
Wilson-Hilferty approximation [Ibacache-Pulgar et al. (2014)]. In these cases, the distances in (5) are
adapted to accommodate the regressive structure and the univariate or bivariate condition.
    Figure 2 shows the probability-probability (PP) plots of the transformed Mahalanobis distance for
the univariate t regression models of earnings and hours worked. The PP plot is commonly used
to assess how close 2 sets of data are, which is done by plotting the 2 corresponding cumulative
distribution functions. The closer the points are from the 450̂ line from (0.0) to (1.1), the best is the
fit. Figure 2, shows the cumulative distribution function of the standard Normal versus the empirical
cumulative distribution function of the transformed Mahalanobis distance. The results reveal a good
fit of the univariate models.

   Figure 3 shows the PP plot of the transformed Mahalanobis distance for the bivariate t regression
model of earnings and hours worked. Notice that there is a good fit for the bivariate case. The results
suggest that in both univariate and bivariate cases, the t models provide good adjustments and can
therefore be used.

2.3    Estimations and analyses
   Table 3 reports the results of the maximum likelihood estimation for the bivariate t distribution
regression model of earnings and hours worked, with the respective standard errors, Wald statistics,
and p-values. The model based on the t distribution presented the best fit according to the AIC and
BIC information criteria and the PP plot of the Mahalanobis distance reported in the previous section.
The Wald statistic is used to test the following hypotheses: H0 : θ = θ0 versus H1 : θ 6= θ0 . The Wald

statistic is defined by:

which is approximately distributed as a standard Normal under H0 , in which θb and θ0 are the estimator
and its proposed value under H0 , respectively. In this case, the interest lies in knowing if θ0 = 0 or
H0 : θ = 0 versus H1 : θ 6= 0, at a significance level of α = 0.05 (or 5%).
   Regarding the interpretation of the estimated coefficients, attention should be paid to the following
cases:

    • When the independent variable x is quantitative (for instance, number of years in school) and
      the value of the coefficient estimated is: (i) out of range: −0.05 ≤ βb ≤ 0.05, there is an increase
      (or decrease if the estimate is negative) of (exp(β)b − 1) × 100% in the expected value (mean) of
      the dependent variable due to an increase of 1 unit in x; (ii) within the range −0.05 ≤ βb ≤ 0.05,
      there is an increase (or decrease if the estimate is negative) (exp(β) b − 1) ≈ βb × 100% in the
      expected value (mean) of the dependent variable when x increases by one unit.

    • When the independent variable x is a dummy (for instance, gender) and the coefficient value is:
      (i) out of range −0.05 ≤ βb ≤ 0.05, there is an increase (or decrease if the estimate is negative)
      of (exp(β)b − 1) × 100% in the expected value (mean) of the dependent variable when x changes
      from 0 (women) to 1 (men); (ii) within the range −0.05 ≤ βb ≤ 0.05, we have an increase (or
                                                 b − 1) ≈ βb × 100% in the expected value (mean) of
      decrease if the estimate is negative) (exp(β)
      the dependent variable when x changes from 0 (women) to 1 (men).

   Table 3 shows that the estimated coefficient of correlation between earnings and hours worked is
0.1877 and statistically significant at the 5% significance level. This also indicates that the bivariate
model is more appropriate than the univariate that estimates the equations separately, which could
lead to incorrect predictions.

    Considering the estimated coefficients, the variable "Gender" indicates that men have an average
income 34.58% higher than women, and that they offer 8.62% more hours worked, on average, than
women do. On the other hand, the variable "Race" reveals that caucasian individuals earn, on average,
10.31% more than non-caucasians. However, when it comes to hours worked, caucasians only offer
0.02% more hours than non-caucasians. This result confirms previous studies that find discrimination
in the Brazilian labor market. Cavalieri and Fernandes (1998), for example, found discrimination us-
ing data from the 1989 PNAD. They found that the income of men was higher than that of women and
that the income of caucasian individuals was higher than that of non-caucasians, even after including
control variables for age, number of years in school, and region of residence.
    The "Age" variable indicates that for each additional year of age there is an increase of 5.27% in the
average income, while only 1.28% is increased in hours worked. Regarding the variable "Education",
an increase of one year of study causes an increase of 4.68% in the average income. However, in
terms of hours worked, this same increase in schooling leads to an average decrease of 0.09%. Thus,
the higher the individual’s schooling, the higher their average earnings and the lower their number of
hours of work. This illustrates a fundamental advantage of the bivariate regression, since the effect
of "Education" is distinct in both regressions and this is not captured by the traditional univariate
estimation that considers a unique dependent variable. Lau et al. (1993) also found a positive effect of
"Education" on earnings (per capita) due to the higher schooling. Regarding hours worked, Gonzaga
et al. (2002) argue that, in Brazil, schooling is inversely related to hour of work.
    Considering the metropolitan regions, Brasília-DF presents an average income 8.95% higher and
offers 2.70% less of hours of work than São Paulo-SP. Here, it is also possible to identify distinct
effects of an explanatory variable in the bivariate regression that cannot be captured by the traditional
univariate model. In order to explain this result, the unobservable characteristics of the workers,
such as skill, motivation, among others, and the specific differences of the sectors of activity and the
geographical regions of the country should be observed. In this specific case, the differential is due
to the location of the federal public administration in Brasília. The federal public servants receive
salaries well above the average of the private sector.
    Regarding the types of labor contracts and considering individuals "with employment record card"
as the reference category, the estimates point out that those with "no employment record card" have an
average wage 17.73% lower. In addition, they offer about 15.08% less hours worked than their peers
"with employment record card". The "civil servant" category incorporates, on average, an increase
of 26.90% in wage while offering an average of 4.10% less hours worked in relation to the workers
"with employment record card". Meanwhile, those who work for "own account" have an average
wage 12.82% lower and offer 16.04% less hours to the labor market than the reference category. It
is worth mentioning that the variable "civil servant" also present antagonistic effects on earnings and
hours worked, which might be captured only by bivariate estimation.
    For variables that affect only earnings or hours worked, Table 3 shows that individuals who con-
tribute to social security have an average earning 42.70% higher than those who do not contribute.
The "head" variable, which affects only hours worked, confirms that heads of households offer 1.80%
more hours of work on average than those who are not in this condition.
    For comparison purposes, Table 4 presents the results of the traditional univariate regression in
which the dependent variable is earnings per hour, as commonly used in the Mincerian regression.
In principle, some results show similarity in terms of magnitude with the estimates of the bivariate
regression model. However, as already pointed out, the univariate model cannot disentangle the effects
of a given explanatory variable on earnings and hours worked, as were the cases of "Education",

"Brasília-DF", and "Civil Servant" in the bivariate regression. These variables reported different
signals for earnings and hours worked regressions. For "Education", for instance, the higher the
individual’s years of schooling, the higher his average income and the lower the quantity of hours
worked. However, in the univariate regression reported in Table 4, only the positive impact of an
additional year of study on the average earnings per hour can be captured. In addition, the bivariate
model captured a positive and significant correlation between the 2 dependent variables, which allows
for a more accurate estimation than the adjustment of 2 independent regressions. Therefore, there are
important advantages of the bivariate model, including the evidence that the determinants of earnings
and hours worked might not be the same in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Thus, the bivariate
estimation appears as an relevant alternative for the estimation of the Mincerian earnings equation.

3    Conclusion
   This paper proposed an alternative approach to estimate the Mincerian earnings equation based
on bivariate regression modeling. The combination of earnings and hours worked in a single depen-
dent variable, as traditionally is done in the empirical literature, prevents capturing distinct effects
of common covariates on those dependent variables. On the other hand, the univariate estimation of

                                                                 12
independent regression for earnings and hours worked is not indicated due to the correlation between
these variables, which might generate biased estimates. Thus, we estimated a regression for earnings
and hours worked as a bivariate vector of dependent variables, including common and specific covari-
ates among the explanatory variables and using the Normal, Student t and BS bivariate distributions.
The estimates were made for the Brazilian economy using data at the individual level extracted from
the PNAD-IBGE survey for the years from 2013 to 2015, totalizing 167,271 observations.
   In the bivariate case, the Normal, t and BS distributions were used to jointly model earnings and
hours worked. The AIC and BIC information criteria and the Mahalanobis distance indicated that the
t distribution yielded the best fit to the estimated models. In addition, a positive and statistically sig-
nificant correlation was observed between earnings and hours worked, justifying the use of bivariate
regression in detriment of independent regressions, which might yield biased estimates.
   The bivariate estimation indicated that a given common covariate might generate distinct effects on
earnings and hours worked. The results for "Education", for instance, indicated that an additional year
of study leads to an average increase of 4.68% in earnings and an average decrease of 0.9% in hours
worked. This suggests that individuals with more years of schooling, on average, have higher wages
and work less than those with less years of schooling. Other covariates common to the bivariate
vector, such as type of employment contract and geographic location, also had antagonistic effects
on earnings and hours worked. This evidence illustrates a fundamental advantage of the bivariate
regression, which allows to disentangle the distinct effects of a given common covariates on earnings
and hours worked. This cannot be done by the traditional estimation of the univariate regression that
considers the earnings per hour as a sole dependent variable.
   Thus, the bivariate regression might be considered as an alternative approach for the estimation
of the Mincerian earnings equation. As further work, one might implement the Heckman two-step
correction for selection bias (Heckman, 1979), since the PNAD survey refers to individuals who were
actually working in the sample period. However, the individual’s earnings are associated with the
decision to offer work, which ultimately depends on their opportunity cost. It is advantageous to
work if the wage received (or potential earnings) are greater than the opportunity cost (reservation
wage). In addition, other bivariate probability distributions might be adjusted for modeling earnings
and hours worked, such as Pareto and its extensions, which are commonly used for income modeling.
Finally, a bivariate logistic regression model could be used to estimate the influence of individual
characteristics on the probabilities of a given worker belonging to a particular income group and type
of work. Some of these extensions are object of ongoing research.

   Distributions and bivariate regression models

    In the symmetric context, the bivariate Normal distribution has been intensely used in the literature
[Johnson et al. (1995)]. However, an alternative symmetric to the bivariate Normal distribution is the
Student t model, as in Johnson et al. (1995) and Balakrishnan and Lai (2009), which has heavier
tails than the Normal bivariate distribution. This flexibility is important to accommodate observations
with more outliers, which makes the t an alternative of interest. On the other hand, in the univariate
asymmetric context, a distribution that has received considerable attention is the BS model, which
was introduced by Birnbaum and Saunders (1969) whereby its genesis is motivated by material fa-
tigue problems [Johnson et al. (1995)]. Recently, Saulo et al. (2019, 2018) proposed a bivariate BS
distribution and its corresponding regression model, based on the univariate BS distribution reparam-
eterized by the mean proposed by Santos-Neto et al. (2012). In this reparameterization, there is no
need to transform the dependent variable to a logarithmic scale, which is an advantage since it can lead
to difficulties in interpretation. In general terms, Normal, Student t, and BS bivariate distributions can
be considered as good candidates in the context of modeling earnings and hours worked, since in the
the Normal and t cases the logarithm of the data is used, i.e. the log-normal and log-t are considered
for the level variables [Vanegas and Paula (2016)], and in the BS case, the data (asymmetric on the
right) are used in the original scale. The Normal, Student t, and BS bivariate distributions and their
respective regression models are presented in sequence.

   Let Y = (Y1 , Y2 )> be a bivariate random vector following a bivariate normal distribution with
means µ1 e µ2 , and standard deviations σ1 e σ2 . In addition to these 4 parameters there is a cor-
relation coefficient ρ between Y1 and Y2 defined by −1 < ρ < 1. Therefore, denoting Y ∼
NBiv(µ1 , µ2 , σ1 , σ2 , ρ). The joint probability density function (PDF)of Y1 and Y2 can be written as:
