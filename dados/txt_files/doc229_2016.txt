O Brasil possui um Sistema de educação superior com a coexistência de instituições públicas
gratuitas e privadas pagas. Cerca de ¾ das matrículas estão em instituições privadas. Ainda bastante
reguladas, instituições privadas podem adquirir outras instituições privadas. Apresentamos uma visão
geral da dinâmica desta indústria para confirmar que as fusões foram a estratégia adotada por
grandes grupos para expandir, dada as baixas taxas de entrada no setor, que apontam para
significativas barreiras à entrada. A maior parte das fusões foram em mercados locais onde a
mantenedora adquirente não atuava. Avaliamos o efeito destas fusões sobre o emprego, e também
sobre a produção (número de matrículas), através de um modelo dif-in-dif, coerente com a teoria
econômica de fusões. Os resultados indicam que as fusões geram uma redução no número de
docentes das instituições adquiridas, de forma proporcional à redução nas matrículas destas
instituições.

                                              Abstract
Brazil has a dual higher education market with the coexistence of public no-tuition institutions and
private tuition-funded enterprises. About ¾ of enrollments are in private higher education institutions
(HEI). Still heavily regulated, since the market liberalization in 1997, private institutions can merge
and acquire (M&A) other private HEI. We provide an overview of the recent growth of this sector
and the significant role of mergers and aquisitions. We show that entry rates are small and fastest
growing HEIs exploited M&A extensively. We evaluate the effects of mergers on employment.
Using Difference-in-Difference analysis, we estimate smaller faculty size and a proportional to a
reduction in enrollment after a merger, on average.

   1. Introduction
Higher education systems present different configurations over the world. In Brazil, there is a dual
system, with the coexistence of tax-funded, tuition free public universities and tuition funded private
institutions. The public universities are rationed by student admission exams that seldom have excess
supply. Private universities, on the other hand, are responsible for about 75% of national enrollment.

It is a heavily regulated sector with government control over entry and quantity and quality. Tuition
is unregulated and there is ample public student funding either through federally funded loans or tax
breaks to universities. Recently (1997) for profit private higher education institutions (HEI) were
allowed and mergers could be carried out between HEI. Following a surge in private equity funding
and foreign institutional investors (IFC, BlackRock, Advent and others, e.g., Economist, 2012), a
small group of firms started a sector consolidation. More than forty mergers were registered at the
competition authority from 2009 to 2014.

Growth has been impressive. Enrollment almost doubled from 1980-2000 and almost tripled in the
following fourteen years. From 2000-2014 private enrollment increased more than threefold. In the
US, Kwoka and Snyder (2004) indicate that it took fourty years for enrollment to increase fivefold in
the US, from 1955 to 1997.

In this paper we seek two goals. First, we provide a detailed account of industry dynamics and
demographics including mergers and also review the competition authority (CADE) response to
these mergers. Second, we conduct higher education sector merger impact evaluation on employment
and enrollment.

The Brazilian case is very rich insofar there is a large private sector and the sheer pace of mergers
creates significant variation in the data set to estimate merger effects even with a small time frame.
Employment effects of mergers are evaluated with different methods after Conyon et al. (2002).
Opposite effects are expected: if mergers are motivated by synergies opportunities such as
economies of scale or more efficient allocation, employment should decrease after a merger; yet,
better management (or financial standing) increase firm competitiveness that boost output expanding
employment. The direction of the effect is not predictable ex-ante.

Closest to our impact analysis of higher education mergers is Garcia and Azevedo (2015) that focus
on majors and student quality. Using a D-i-D method (with matching) on majors/degrees on limited
sample of HEI experiencing mergers, they conclude that the level of student standardized test scores
increase after a merger by a large “network” firm, i.e. a multi HEI institution. Instead of looking at
quality we focus on employment and consider all courses in the HEIs.

We use a linear standard D-i-D model as prediction models for mergers (required for first stage
matching models) often have difficulties in discriminating merging and non-merging HEI based on
local and observed characteristics. This is seen in Garcia and Azevedo (2015), that evaluate large
merger effects on quality. Few variables predict mergers and balancing tests change little from
before and after reweighting across explanatory variables.

Our main identification hypothesis comes from merger motives (Motta, 2004, Mottis, 2007, inter
allia). Mergers are profitable if they transform the acquired unit. Merger targets are generally
inefficient or can be made more efficient or profitable after a change in management practices,
technology or product mix. This points to permanent characteristics as relevant to identify merger
targets and merger effects, instead of transitory profitability shocks to firms. This suggests that D-i-D
in panel data is the required strategy, in the absence of natural experiments, instead of matching
models. This point is made forcefully by Chabe-Ferret (2014, 2015).

Advancing our results, we see that the sector regulation pushed firms to grow through mergers and
acquisitions. Entry and exit rates are very small and entrants are much smaller on average. More than
2/3 or mergers were in local markets where acquirers did not operate. The sector has followed a trend
since liberalization in the 1990s, moving from non-profit only private institutions to a majority of
for-profit private institutions. The fastest growing firms adjusted their major/degree portfolio to
explore economies of scale with emphasis of distance learning.

Regarding the effects of mergers on employment and enrollment, using a standard Differences-in-
Differences analysis we see that after a merger enrollment numbers drop with an accompanying
effect on faculty; there is a lagged positive effect on the ratio of PhDs in faculty total. The drop in
faculty seems to be proportional to enrollment reductions, as there is no significant effect on teacher-
per-student ratio. Garcia and Azevedo (2015) also found positive effects of mergers on faculty PhD
ratios.

This paper is organized in six sections including this introduction. In the following section we
provide a short regulatory overview of higher education in Brazil, with a focus of firm dynamics.
The following section presents an overall view of the industry, with entry and exit and merger level
estimates. The four section summarizes the antitrust authority approach and outcomes to mergers
between HEI. The effects of mergers (filed or not with the antitrust authority) on employment and
enrollment are studied in section five and section six provides concluding comments.




   2. Industry growth and dynamics
Higher education is an extensively regulated industry in Brazil, with oversight by the Education
Ministry and other regulatory bodies, such as the Nation Education Council (Conselho Nacional de
Educação) that write legislation on the sector. The ministry oversees HEI’s entry and course
openings, maximum enrollment levels and quality. Throughout we consider a degree a major such as
Economics or Mechanical Engineering. HEI quality is evaluated permanently with overlapping three
year course evaluation cycles. Product wise, there are three types of HEI degrees: ‘Bacharelado’
(B.A., taking 4 to 5 years); ‘Tecnólogo’ (2-year degrees, with a more practical approach) and
‘Licenciatura’ (3-4 year Basic, School, Education Teacher training). Tecnólogo should not be
confused with technical or vocational training, that may be part of high school. The 2-years courses
were regulated in 1997 (‘Decreto 2208/1997’) and 2001 (‘Parecer CNE/CES 436/2001’).


                                                                                                       3
The Education Law (Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação - LDB, 1996) consolidated a coexistence
of public and private institutions. Decree 2307/1997 allows for-profit firms to control HEI. To
segregate financial assets and liabilities from educational assets, HEIs are required to be funded by
an institution called ‘Mantenedora’. The above mentioned decree allowed these ‘Mantenedora’ to be
private for-profit firms. There is partial control over course/major openings by the regulator.
Universities and ‘Centro Universitário’ may decide to start a new course, with no pre-notification to
the Ministry of Education. Small colleges (‘Faculdades’) are required a pre-authorization by the
Ministry of Education (see e.g., Octavianni, 2013).

In the late 1990´s the National Education Council allowed higher education degrees be awarded
through distance learning (DL). It started as means to reach basic education teachers in all corners of
the country (Chaves, 2010). The 1996 LDB set the goal to have all basic education teachers with at
least a 3-4 year degree. Since Decree 5622/2005, DL majors are allowed as long as there is support
from a local base (‘polo’), where students must cover at least exams and attend online classes with a
tutor in the premises. Also note that Distance Learning/online courses as a teaching technique may
be used in up to 25% of non-distance learning degrees, generating economies of scope. (Frazão,
2014, inter allia)

The sector had been growing quickly over the last 10-15 years as seen in Table 1. From 2004-2014
enrollments almost doubled, reaching about 8 million students. This is still shy from the national
goal of 50% of all 18-24 year olds in absolute and relative terms. There is a significant number of
higher education students 25 or older. The share of enrollments in private HEI has been hovering
around the 25% mark since 2007 from a 30% share in 2003.

Distance learning experienced very fast growth with a level change in 2008. Currently, 17% of
enrolled students are in distance learning courses. Interestingly, while distance learning degrees
started at the public universities, private universities embraced this teaching mode with gusto. In
2014, 90% of distance learning students are in private universities. Economies of scale may be a
reason behind this shift. There are significant cost savings in labor and the possibility to reach
students in more locations with distance learning. (Economist, 2014). These savings are passed on to
students, so that distance learning prices are 20-50% cheaper than same major non-distance learning
degrees (based on 2013 data).

Regarding degree types, from 2009 to 2014, the latest figures available, Table 2 indicates that private
universities have expanded their BA/4year enrollments at the expense of teacher degrees
(‘Licenciatura’). Breaking up these figures by teaching method (distance and non-distance learning)
on Table 3, BA and 2year degrees have expanded their role in distance learning. Firms are moving
away from teacher education in distance learning and focusing on professional and other majors.

Firm size grew over time. From 2010-2014 average size increased from 2863 students to 3312.1
students. Given stability in HEI numbers, overall expansion was solely due to average firm size.
Firm size distribution differ between private and public institutions (Figure 1-A). Public institutions
are larger overall, but the largest institutions in the country are private. The firm size distribution for
private institutions is surprisingly close to log-normal (although this can be rejected at standard
significance levels). Over time, firm size growth is visible (Figure 1-B for private HEIs).

Firm dynamics can be measured in two complementary ways. First, we look at entry and exit and
mergers by HEI. Second we look at entry and exit of majors/degrees within institutions. This allows
us to explore two extensive margins: setting up new firms and setting up new ‘product lines’, using a
manufacturing analogy.

Our data set is well suited to this task. The Higher Education Census by the Ministry of
Education/INEP is a census of all HEI. Firms (HEIs) receive a unique identifier over its lifetime.
There are also unique, different controller (‘Mantenedora’) identifiers. Entry is recorded as a new
identifier in the data base and exit as a disappearance of an identifier in the data. INEP follows firms
to guarantee that information is provided. The asynchronous evaluation cycle for degrees in the
institutions and information requirements for funding from the government guarantee that firms file
the Census information every year. Mergers are identified as change in ‘Mantenedora’ code. After a
merger if a HEI name changes this does not imply an institution identifier change allowing us to
track mergers.

                     entry rates and merger rates measures as ratio of enrollment in new/merged HEI
                     w.r.t. total enrollment in higher education. E.g., 0,28% of total enrollment
                     (bottom part) for 2014 were in the HEI that account for the 2% entry rate in that
                     year.




Entry and exit rates are relatively small in this industry. Compared to nationwide rates of 12-8% for
entry and exit in services (OECD, 2014) and 15-20% in manufacturing (Rezende, Ribeiro and
Zaidan, 2015), churning is much smaller in the higher education sector. At the same time, mergers
are quite active in higher education, often with rates higher than entry or exit. Our data points out
that more HEIs traded controllers than new HEI started operating in 2011 (See Table 4).

Weighted by enrollments the figures are even more impressive (see bottom part of Table 4). In 2010
5% of all enrollments were in acquired firms. In the same year, new firms enrollment was only 0.2%
of total. This difference is partly influenced by firm sizes (entrants are generally smaller), but
nevertheless highlight the relevance of mergers in this industry.

Mergers are used as an entry strategy by large groups in new (local) markets. Out of the 348 local
market mergers 85% were on markets where the acquirer did not operate previously.

We adapt job reallocation measures (Davis and Haltiwanger, 1999) to explore enrollment effects of
entry and exit. We consider a major/degree a productive unit and enrollment figures its ‘output’. Net
yearly enrollment growth is broken up in four components: enrollment growth from new major (in
either new or previously active HEIs) on continuing growing and contracting majors (active in the
previous year) and from course/major closings. Growth is measured in gross levels, that is, we
segregate degrees with positive net growth (enrollment creation) and negative net growth (enrollment
destruction) 1. The figures from Table 5 indicate that there is significant enrollment reallocation
across majors, with rates higher than 20% for a net growth of 5% on average from 2010-2014.
New/exiting majors respond for a quarter of this reallocation, with actual rates varying yearly. 2010
seems an outlier explained mostly the authorization of new courses, when firms took advantage of
the impressive growth of worker wages and output in the economy (2010 experienced the largest
GDP per capita growth since the 1980s).

Regarding quality, we use two indicators. First, the HEI overall evaluation rate (IGC) published by
INEP/Ministry of Education. It is based on tri-annual major rotating student graduation national
exams, in loco assessments and permanent evaluations of each course in the HEI. It is a relative
score from 1 to 5. HEI with a score of 1 cannot contract new students and HEI with 2 are due in loco
regulator visits and improvement agreements.

As seen in Figure 2, 38.1% of public universities have a general grade of 4 or 5, while 15.1% private
universities have such grades. The majority (64%) of private HEIs have a grade of 3. Relatively more
private universities have a grade of 2 or 1 than public universities. The lower grades for private
universities are not a surprise. According to one of the private HEI largest group financial statements

       “While the public higher education institutions are directed to serve as centers of excellence
       and research, with extremely competitive admissions standards and a limited capacity for
       expansion, the private higher education institutions are focusing their attention on the
       professional requirements imposed by the labor market and they develop flexible programs to
       meet the needs of the working population.” (Anima 2015)

Zoghbi et al. (2013) comparing HEI productivity in quality production form Brazil argued that once
student characteristics are taken into account, private institutions seem more productive than public
HEI regarding student quality growth over the college years as measured by standardized student
exams.

Another view on quality is based on faculty skill level. Table 6 presents the evolution of faculty in
the HEIs, highlighting the share of PhD(Doctorate) and public and private institutions. From 2003 to
2014 faculty numbers increased 56% and the number of those faculty with a PhD increased 152%. It
must be noted that there was a significant expansion of the number of PhD/Doctorate programs in the
country, growing from MA programs in the mid and late 1990´s. The share of PhD faculty increased
from 21% to 35% in HE overall.

Regarding private institutions, the relative share of faculty in private institutions decreased from 65%
to 57%. In private HEIs there was a 37% increase in faculty numbers. Given the almost doubling of
enrollments in these institutions, enrollment/faculty ratio increased from 16 to more than 25. Part of
this more intense use of labor inputs can be associated with the shift towards distance learning.
Nevertheless, the relative share of PhDs in private faculty numbers actually increased (from 12% in
2003 to 20% in 2014), following the public universities trend.

Regarding antitrust evaluation, the first merger evaluated at CADE was in 2007 (Teodorovicz et al.
2015), under the 1994 antitrust law, requiring firms with more than BRL400 million (USD
100million in 2010) in revenues to file. From 2011 on there is a significant change in market
definition. On a demand based relevant market definition, a degree/major, such as Economics, or
Accounting, should be consider a product relevant market. Regarding geographical markets,
catchment areas from the acquired institution were defined as geographical markets. There are small
adjustments to specific degrees: for ‘Tecnologo’ (2yr degrees), product markets are defined as degree
groups (e.g. ‘business’, including hospital management, logistics management, human resources
management), as defined by regulation. Graduate degrees (MBA, MA and PhD) are taken as a
separate product market and their geographical markets are state wide.

Concentration rates started to increase is specific locations, such as São Paulo and other metropolitan
areas. An extensive list of mergers are seen in Teodorivcs et al. (2014) and Garcia and Azevedo
(2015). Most cases concluded that entry is not effective to contest mergers. Regulation may take
more than two years to allow firm entry even if start up size could be small (this is particularly acute
in distance learning). Entrants start too small to effectively compete in this sector. Regarding rivalry,
the market seems segmented in two dimensions: first from a quality x price perspective: prices vary
significantly according to quality, such that there is limited substitution within major across HEI;
second, brands are important (marketing are usually the largest expense of the largest firm, after
labor) so national, marketing-intense brands compete with each other, mostly isolated from a fringe
of small, ‘faculdade’ local institutions.

Firms recognize synergies from elimination of staff redundancies and administrative costs (markedly
on marketing and class sizes). (Frazão, 2014) So far, efficiencies have not been recognized as a
merger clearance argument by CADE.



   3. Empirical analysis of merger effects
The analysis of merger effects has a small but growing literature (e.g. LEAR 2006). In many cases
this evaluation use structural methods and simulation (Eaniv and Levin, 2010), but there is a growing
range of papers using treatment effect analysis. This can be traced back to event studies (e.g., Eckbo,
2002). We evaluate the effect of all mergers in the industry from 2009 to 2014 using a difference-in-
difference (D-i-D) approach. This method may be adequate to an ex-post evaluation of mergers
where there is no information on prices and costs, as is our case (Angrist and Pischke, 2010).

Empirical analysis focuses of employment effects of mergers. As in Lehto and Böckerman (2008) we
compare employment growth before and after the merge in relation to a control group of companies
that did not merge. The identification hypothesis is that first, there are aggregate common effects on
the companies, common trajectories between merged and not merged companies. They use matching
methods to a more flexible semi-parametric control of observables in the treatment evaluation (see
e.g., Cameron and Trivedi, 2010). This is the same avenue taken by Garcia and Azevedo (2015) for
higher education mergers effects on quality in Brazil



                                                                                                      11
We apply linear methods in order to control for unobserved factors using linear panel D-i-D
approach. Using panel data allows us to control for HEI unobservables. In addition, Garcia and
Azevedo(2015) results can be interpreted suggesting that predicting mergers is very difficult,
limiting the contribution of more complex methods (such as matching) to calculate effects. In their
study before and after sample balancing tests of observable characteristics on treated and non-treated
groups change very little.

Compared to Garcia and Azevedo (2015) we consider all mergers between HEIs, identified by a
change in controller firm (‘Mantenedora’). Those authors considered only large ‘Mantenedora’
mergers (large enough to be filed with the competition authority, CADE). We have three times more
mergers to evaluate. Contrary to previous work, we focus on HEI and not major/degree, as our focus
is on employment and enrollment. It is very difficult to segregate employment by major, as a faculty
may teach in more than one major and more than one major may use the same course in its curricula.
Regulatory restrictions impede the merger of a specific major, only an entire HEI, suggesting a focus
on the HEI institution as a whole.

As mentioned in the introduction, theoretical employment effects of mergers may be negative but
could also be positive (Coyon et al. 2002). After a merger, better management or economies of scale
may reduce employment. The efficiencies, on the other hand, may allow a firm to increase size and
expand employment. It is not possible to tell which effect will dominate ex-ante.

Modelling starts with the estimation of a treatment prediction model, i.e., a model that would
discriminate between merged and non-merged HEI. Merger models consider a myriad of reasons for
a firm to be targeted and actually merged (Motis, 2007). In shareholder value creation models target
firms may have inefficient outcomes (productive inefficiencies, overstaff). There may be accounting
and economic synergies also. And target firms may provide strategic market space to enhance
acquirer market power. Given that most mergers in this industry were regional market entry mergers,
one can give less relevance to the latter argument. In any case it may be difficult to select
observables to explain why a firm is merged but for simple efficiency indicators such as
student/faculty ratios. Potential market size is also a relevant indicator, suggesting the use of regional
income indicators.

Our prediction model uses firm time varying variables and regional aggregate variables. As first pass
we seek a good prediction model, so claims on actual exogeneity of explanatory variables will be
limited in scope. In non-experimental settings as ours, such exogeneity is difficult to prove requiring
truly exogenous variables for evaluation (Angrist and Pischke, 2009). Different unobservable effects
may be possible. We consider transitory unobservable (to the researcher, but known to the merging
firms) shocks on profitability in no-fixed-effects model. We also consider permanent time invariant
unobserved effects in fixed-effects models. Both are polar cases and we consider both as a robustness
analysis. The first assumption motivates the use of lagged explanatory variables and the second one
precludes the use of time invariant measures such as firm type (e.g. for-profit/non-for-profit). As
additional robustness analysis we consider non-linear (logit) and linear models. Here, we highlight
the predictive capacity of the models, so we limit the regressions output to Table A1 in the
Appendix.

Table 7 present the observed (columns) and fitted values (rows) for merger in HEI i at time t. The
models without fixed effects (Logit and Least Squares) have reasonable predictive ability. 64%
(74%) of mergers were correctly predicted in the Logit (Least Squares) model. About half (43%) of
the non-merged HEI over time were correctly predicted as merged in the Logit (Least Squares)
model. Fixed effects play an important role as expected. In the Logit model, given the nature of the
model (see, e.g. Cameron and Trivedi, 2010), it predict mergers perfectly but misses almost all non-
merger HEI activity. The linear fixed effect model has a more balanced result, with perfect

prediction of merged observations and extremely high correction prediction of non-merged (about
91%). The fixed effect can exactly predict merging firms but it is important to note than non-merged
firms were predicted as merger-like even with those fixed effects, pointing to the role of time varying
(firm or regional) variables. It should be noted that predicted probability in the fixed effects LS
without using fixed effects for prediction yield very similar results to OLS, suggesting that
unobservables are not significantly altering the prediction capacity of explanatory variables used in
the model (while they may correct biases in the coefficient estimates).



After evaluating the predictive capacity of our explanatory variables we consider our D-i-D estimates
with and without controls. We consider three different estimate methods: fixed effects least squares,
fixed effects least squares with autocorrelation corrected standard errors (following suggestion that in
panel D-i-D estimates may significantly underestimate standard errors due to error autocorrelation by
Bertrand et al., 2004) and dynamic merger effects, using both current and lagged merger indicator. In
all models we use time and HEI fixed effects. The basic, no-controls, estimating equation are

where yit is the target variable, Mit a dummy indicating that the HEI changed ‘Mantendora’ to an
existing one (was acquired by another firm) at year t. As target variables we use log employment
(total faculty number, total staff), faculty/enrollment ratio, faculty PhD share in total faculty and log
enrollment (total, non distance-learning and distance learning). The μi and ut are firm and time fixed
effects and εit is an random error, possibly first-order autocorrelated.

Table 8 estimates indicate that faculty figures fall between 9 and 5% in merger HEI and the dynamic
effect may be even larger. Staff levels do not decrease or its estimates are not precise enough to
allow us to claim that it is reduced after a merger. Interestingly faculty enrollment ratio is not altered
with a merger, as well as PhD faculty ratio. Given the absence of faculty-enrollment ratio effects, it
is expected that acquired HEI enrollment also decreases. This is confirmed in the bottom part of
Table 8. The effect comes squarely from non-distance learning enrollment as there are no significant,
precise, effects on distance learning enrollment. It must be pointed out that HEIs with distance
learning are few, about 15% of overall estimate sample, contributing to the large standard errors.

In a D-i-D analysis a key point is selecting the control group. In Table 8, the control group includes
all private HEI that did not merge, conditional on firm time invariant heterogeneity.

Table 9 below presents a robustness analysis in two directions. First, it restricts the analysis to
regions (municípios) where there was at least one merger over the 2009-2014 period. This is
equivalent to arguing that those markets have specific (unobserved) characteristics (static and
dynamic) that interact with firm observables and non-observables and influence the comparison
group. Second, we use explanatory variables, such as regional variables.

Table 9 indicates that restricting the sample has little effect on the results for columns (1)-(3), that
are directly comparable to columns (1)-(3) in Table 8. Using control variables, in general do not
change the sign of the effects but It is clear that observables reduce the size of the effects but do not
change the conclusions overall, except for Total faculty, that becomes insignificant, and Distance
Learning effects, that become significant.

Concluding Comments
In this paper we provided an overview of higher education industry recent dynamics in Brazil.
Higher education in Brazil grew significantly over the past decade, increasing three fold. There was
an expansion of private institutions, attaining 75% of national enrollment. Expansion in this industry
has pointed to a trend on distance learning and shorter, two-year, programs/degrees. Concentration
has steadily increased, with the five largest groups controlling more than 20% of private higher
education institutions (HEI) enrollment. Some of these firms are very large and are quoted in the
stock exchange from 2009 on.

Mergers played a significant role in industry dynamics. Given the very small entry and exit rates,
possibly due to regulatory restrictions, mergers were a natural expansion path for equity funded
firms. At the competition authority (CADE), more than 50 mergers were filed from 2008 to 2015,
some of them very large (reportedly reaching the billions dollar mark).

We reviewed how the competition authority dealt with these mergers. Relevant market definition
changed. Currently, each undergraduate major/degree, such as Economics or Mechanical
Engineering is considered a separate product market. Geographical market definition is based on
enrolled students’ catchment areas from acquired institutions. Some mergers required remedies that
dealt with the transfer of majors/degrees to other HEI. This type of remedy is constrained by
regulation. The Ministry of Education allows the sale of a major/degree only if those programs are
bundled in a working accredited HEI. Other remedies imposed included capacity expansion
constraints and quality targets.

The large proportion of mergers in this industry, the labor intensity of this service industry and the
possibility of direct identification of control change provide an interesting opportunity to evaluate
merger effects. For lack of information on prices we focus on employment and enrollment. We do
not consider the effect on quality (as evaluated in Garcia and Azevedo (2015) for a limited set of
large mergers) as industry discussion emphasize enrollment as a key output indicator.

Employment effects of mergers may be negative, if mergers are motivated by efficiency enhancing
opportunities or market power (Croyon et al. 2002). The employment effect may be positive if the
post-merger, more efficient, HEI expands output. The final direction of the merger effect is an
empirical matter.

After presenting merger predictive models, where linear and non-linear models generated
comparable results, we followed a Difference-in-Difference approach using panel data. The D-i-D
model for panel data has as main identification hypothesis the role of unobservable permanent
factors that differentiate treated and untreated firms, with a lesser or no role of transitory (time
varying, mean reverting unobservable random variables) effects on treatment. This makes sense for
mergers, are they are profitable only if targets were permanentely different and there is a permanent
transformation of the acquired firm.

Our results suggest that a merger leads to a decrease in faculty numbers with no effect on staff.
Enrollment seems to decrease also, and may explain the faculty reduction, such that average faculty-
student ratio does not seem to change between merged HEI and the control group, before and after

                                                                                                   17
the merger. Our employment quality indicator (faculty PhD ratio) does increase after a lag as
previously in the literature. The results are robust to changes in estimation methods and comparison
groups.

Our results may be limited in a number of directions. We have a limited time frame for mergers to
reveal their full effect, as the merger boom in the industry is relatively new. Our merger prediction
model did not use any financial or productivity information, which may be restrictive, given many
merger motives. We considered the effect on the acquired HEI and not on the total merged entity
only. While most mergers were entry strategies in local markets, there may be staff and student
reallocation within the merged entity that we are not considering here. Last, but not least, we lack
information on productivity and prices, that are generally the focus of competition policy. Given data
availability, these are certainly venues for further research.

Appendix
Enrollment – course reallocation formulae.
All statistics are adapted from Davis and Haltiwanger (2009). Let n cit be the enrollment in
degree/course c, in HEI i at time t. Total HEI enrollment is given by nit=ci nict. Total enrollment at
time t is given by nt= i nit= ici nict. Average biannual enrollment is given by Nt=(nt+nt-1)/2.
Average biannual enrollment is used as denominator for a symmetric percentage growth rate.
New courses enrollment = ici nict/Nt*I( nict≠. and nict-1=.)
Existing Expanding enrollment = ici (nict -nict-1) /Nt*I( nict-nict-1>0)
Existing Expanding enrollment = ici (nict -nict-1) /Nt*I( nict-nict-1<0)
Extinct enrollment = ici - nict-1/Nt*I( nict=. and nict-1 ≠.)
