    This paper tests Phillips curves using an autoregressive distrib-
uted lag (ADL) speci…cation that encompasses the New Keynesian
Phillips curve (NKPC), the Hybrid Phillips curve (HPC), the Sticky-
Information Phillips curve (SIPC), and the accelerationist Phillips
curve (APC). We use data from the United States (1985Q1–2007Q4)
and from Brazil (1996Q1–2012Q2), using the output gap and alterna-
tively the real marginal cost as measure of in‡ationary pressure. The
empirical evidence rejects the restrictions implied by the NKPC, the
HPC, and SIPC, but does not reject those implied by the APC.

1       Introduction
      The empirical evidence shows that in‡ation tends to be pro-cyclical:
periods of above average in‡ation tend to be associated with above aver-
age economic activity. This statistical relationship is known as the Phillips
curve. The Phillips curve was perceived in the 60’s as a menu for monetary
policymakers: they could choose between high in‡ation and low unemploy-
ment or low in‡ation and high unemployment. But this interpretation of
the Phillips curve assumed that the relationship between unemployment and
in‡ation was stable and would not break down once a policymaker attempts
to exploit the tradeo¤. After Friedman’s (1968) paper and the high in‡ation
episodes experienced by many economies in the 1970s, this interpretation of
the Phillips curve was discredited. After a period of low in‡ation in the 1980s
and early 1990s, economists have again worked on a theoretical framework for
the Phillips curve. The New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) provides an
interpretation of the short-run in‡ation-unemployment trade-o¤ by deriving
it from an optimizing framework featuring rational expectations and nominal
rigidities. This is a structural model, designed to be capable of explaining
the behavior of in‡ation without being subject to the Lucas critique. The
NKPC is part of the New Keynesian model which is the workhorse model for
monetary analysis1 . However, to use the NKPC for policy analysis requires
that it has a good econometric track record in describing in‡ation dynamics.
     A large body of research has used time series methods to estimate the
NKPC. Initial attempts to estimate the NKPC using aggregate time series
data for the U.S. were not very successful (Galí and Gertler (1999, GG hence-
forth): the estimated coe¢ cient on the output gap (proxied by detrended real
GDP), was small and often negative in quarterly data. One interpretation
for the poor results using a standard output gap measure is that it is simply
a poor proxy for real marginal cost, which according to the theory would be
the appropriate variable. GG report evidence in favor of the New Keynesian
Phillips curve when labor’s share of income, rather than a standard output
gap variable, is used to proxy for real marginal cost. In order to capture the
in‡ation persistence found in the data, GG modify the basic Calvo model
of sticky prices to introduce lagged in‡ation into the Phillips curve, called
hybrid Phillips curve. Based on U.S. data and using real marginal cost as
the forcing variable, GG conclude that not only the forward looking behavior
is predominant but, given the small estimate of the degree of backwardness,
the pure forward looking model may do a reasonably good job of describing
    1
    According to table C of Hammond (2010), 20 out of 27 in‡ation targeting central banks
either use or are developing Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models
based on the New Keynesian framework for forecasting and policy analysis.

the data. Following the steps of GG, Galí, Gertler and López-Salido (2001)
provided evidence on the …t of the NKPC for the Euro area.
    Rudd and Whelan (2007) in a critical review of the New Keynesian model
argue that the labor’s share version of the model actually provides a very poor
description of observed in‡ation behavior. This failure of the model extends
along two dimensions: …rst, labor’s share fails to provide a good measure
of in‡ationary pressures; and second, this version of the model cannot ac-
count for the important role played by lagged in‡ation in empirical in‡ation
regressions. They provide an alternative interpretation of the empirical es-
timates obtained from the hybrid Phillips curve, and argue that the data
actually provide very little evidence of an important role for forward-looking
behavior of the sort implied by these models.
    As an alternative to the models of sticky prices, Mankiw and Reis (2002)
[MR] argue that sticky information— the slow dispersion of information about
macroeconomic conditions— can help account for the sluggish adjustment of
prices and for the real e¤ects that occur in response to monetary shocks. Ki-
ley (2007) attempted to test the sticky information model of in‡ation against
the sticky price for the United States using maximum-likelihood techniques.
He …nds that, once hybrid-behavior is allowed, hybrid sticky-price models
provide a better description of in‡ation dynamics than a sticky-information
model.
    In a small open-economy exchange-rate movements play an important role
in the transmission process that links monetary disturbances to output and
in‡ation movements. Economic disturbances that originate in other countries
have to be taken into account in monetary policy design that are absent in
a closed-economy environment. In addition, part of the intermediate inputs
are imported from abroad, which consist of mainly raw materials and energy.
Usually the prices of imported inputs are more variable than of domestic
labor as well as domestically produced intermediate inputs. This should—
other things equal— induce …rms to change their prices more frequently and
possibly also by a larger amount in response to more variable input costs.
Price setting is also more complex as the choice of currency, competition from
abroad and the pass-through of exchange rate changes into prices become an
issue. It is therefore not surprising that model building becomes increasingly
di¢ cult when it comes to modelling in‡ation dynamics in an open economy
where the relationship between in‡ation and exchange rate is a key concern.
    Several authors have attempted to estimate the Phillips curve for Brazil,
and some of them were concerned speci…cally with the NKPC. For example,
Areosa and Medeiros (2007) derive and estimate a structural model for in-
‡ation in a small open economy based on the models developed by Campos
and Nakane (2003) and Galí and Monacelli (2005). Their model considers

                                      3
price rigidity according to Calvo (1983) and has in‡ationary inertia in a way
similar to Woodford (2003) and GG. The estimated negative sign in the spec-
i…cation with the output gap contrasts with theory and although the impact
of the estimate associated with the marginal cost is negligible, it is statisti-
cally signi…cant. They …nd a small direct impact of the variables associated
with economic openness, with the sum of their coe¢ cients being close to zero.
However, the indirect impact is signi…cant, consistently changing the weights
associated with lagged in‡ation and the expected future in‡ation. Mazali
and Divino (2010) apply for Brazil the new Keynesian model of Blanchard
and Galí (2007) with real wage rigidity and supply shocks. As the estimated
coe¢ cients satis…ed a set of restrictions imposed by the theoretical model
and over-identifying restrictions were not rejected, they concluded that the
estimated new Phillips curve adjusted very well to the Brazilian data2 .
    This paper tests Phillips curves using an autoregressive distributed lag
(ADL) speci…cation that encompasses the New Keynesian Phillips curve
(NKPC), the Hybrid Phillips curve (HPC), the Sticky-Information Phillips
curve (SIPC), and the accelerationist Phillips curve (APC). We use data from
the United States (1985Q1–2007Q4) and from Brazil (1996Q1–2012Q2), us-
ing the output gap and alternatively the real marginal cost as measure of
in‡ationary pressure. The empirical evidence rejects the restrictions im-
plied by the NKPC, the HPC, and SIPC, but does not reject those implied
by the APC.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the ADL Phillips
curve and shows how the di¤erent Phillips curve speci…cations considered
in the literature can be seen as special cases of the ADL Phillips curve.
Section 3 tests for the U.S. the restrictions implied by the di¤erent Phillips
curve speci…cations. Section 4 tests for Brazil the restrictions implied by the
di¤erent Phillips curve speci…cations. Finally, section 5 brings the concluding
remarks.

  Let us show how each model is embedded in equation (1). The simple
APC (SAPC) is given by

                                                   t   = xt + " t :

This is a particular case of equation (1) when 1 = > 0 and 2 = 3 = 0:
   When expected in‡ation of the Phillips curve depends on additional in-
‡ation lags we have

                            t   = (1       !)          t 1   +!      t 2     + xt + " t :
This is equivalent to

                                       t   =           !     t 1     + xt + " t :

This speci…cation is a particular case of equation (1) when                                                 1   =      > 0 ,
 2 = 0 and 3 < 0.
   The NKPC is given by

                       t        =      Et t+1 + xt + "t
                                =      Et ( t+1  t) +                          t   + xt + " t :

Assuming rational expectations, Et                           t+1     =       t+1          t+1   , the NKPC can be
written as
                              1
                        t+1 =                                    t        xt +        t+1 :

Assuming that         = 1, the acceleration of in‡ation in period t can be ex-

                                               t       =      xt     1   +       t:

This follows from equation (12) when 1 =                                     3     = 0 and      2   =           < 0.
   The HPC proposed by GG is given by

                        t   =!      t 1    + (1              !)E         t+1   + xt + " t :

As with the NKPC, we assume rational expectations and after some algebra
we obtain
                         !
                  t =           t 1           xt 1 + t :
                      (1 !)           (1 !)
This is a particular case of equation (12) when                                       1   =0,       2   =       k= (1    !)
and 3 = != (1 !).

    The assumption that =1, or more generally that the sum of the coe¢ cients of in‡ation
equals to one, implies that the Phillips curve is vertical in the long-run, that is, there is
no tradeo¤ between in‡ation and output (in the long-run).

Assuming rational expectations and using the lag operator Lj Et 1 = Et 1 j
, we obtain after some algebra the following expression for the acceleration
of in‡ation

This expression is a particular case of equation (1) when 1 = (2      )=(1
 )2 > 0 ; 2 = 2 (1          )=(1     )2 < 0 ; and 3 = 0.
    Table 1 shows the restrictions implied by each Phillips curve model sub-
sumed by equation (1), which is an ADL(1,1).

   The ADL Phillips curve [equation (1)] actually encompasses all Phillips
curves as special cases. This provides a convenient framework for analysing
the properties of each model used in empirical research, highlighting their
respective strengths and weaknesses.
   The extended ADL Phillips curve includes additional lags of both ourput
gap and in‡ation acceleration, according to:

    In this paper we test the NKPC against the HPC, the SIPC, and the APC
based on the encompassing ADL Phillips curve [equation (2)]. The empirical
strategy is as follows:
    (i) Formulate a Phillips curve model that encompasses the NKPC, the
HPC, the SIPC, and the APC as special cases — the ADL Phillips curve;
(ii) Reduce the ADL Phillips curve model based on statistical criteria; (iii)
Check which (if any) of the Phillips curve models …ts better the estimated
Phillips curve.

3       Empirical Evidence: United States (1985Q1–
        2007Q4)
     The U.S. sample goes from 1985Q1 to 2007Q4, the period known as
"Great Moderation" due to the decline in the variability of both output and
in‡ation4 . The in‡ation rate ( t ) is measured as the weighted median of
price changes across industries (median in‡ation)5 . The output gap (xt ) is
given by 100 times the di¤erence between the log of the quarterly real GDP
and the log of the Congressional Budget O¢ ce’s estimate of the potential
real GDP.
    We start from the (extended) ADL Phillips curve [equation (2)]. Then, we
reduce the ADL Phillips curve by sequential elimination of regressors based
on t-ratios of the parameters estimators. Allowing an increased number of
lags, we estimate the full model by OLS and then sequentially delete those
regressors with the smallest t-ratios, until the t-ratios are all greater than
the threshold = 2, see table 26 .
    Table 2 shows that the selected model is composed by the …rst two lags of
the change in in‡ation, and the lags of order one and four of the output gap.
The diagnostic tests does not indicate any problems concerning autocorrela-
tion, conditional heteroscedasticity, normality, and regression speci…cation.
Using equation (1) and comparing the values of Tables 1 and 2, we observe
that none of the restrictions implied by the SIPC are veri…ed. Only one of
the restrictions implied by the NKPC and the HPC is accepted ( 1 = 0),
while all their other restrictions are rejected by the U.S. data. The APC has

      James Stock coined the phrase “the great moderation”while writing a research paper
with Mark Watson in 2002 (“Has the Business Cycle Changed and Why?”). It was brought
to the attention of the wider public by Ben Bernanke (then member and now chairman of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve) in a speech titled “The Great Moderation”
in 2004.
    5
      Since Gordon (1982), many empirical researchers add supply shocks to the Phillips
curve. Excluded supply shock variables are positively correlated with in‡ation and pos-
itively correlated with the output gap, so the omission of these supply shock variables
causes the coe¢ cient on the output gap to be biased towards zero. Following Ball and
Mazumber (2011), we de…ne core in‡ation as the part of in‡ation explained not by supply
shocks. With this de…nition one can measure core in‡ation by removing the e¤ects of
supply shocks from total in‡ation. If supply shocks are asymmetries in the distribution
of price changes, then a measure of core in‡ation should eliminate the e¤ects of these
asymmetries. A simple measure, proposed by Bryan and Cecchetti (1994), is the weighted
median of price changes across industries (median in‡ation).
    6
      For the estimations we made two assumptions that are standard in the literature [see,
for example, Ball and Mazumber (2011)]. First, we assumed that the current level of the
output gap (xt ) is uncorrelated with the error term ("t ). Second, we assumed that the
sum of the coe¢ cients of in‡ation equals one.

one restriction right ( 3 < 0) and restrictions on the output gap ( 1 > 0
and 2 = 0) that are consistent with the fact that their sum is positive when
in‡ation depends on additional lags of output gap. Furthermore, if we allow
expected in‡ation of the PC to depend on additional in‡ation lags

This expression can be rewritten as

    Motivated by the NKPC literature, we modi…ed the ADL Phillips curve
by replacing the output gap with the real marginal cost, proxied by the labor
share of income 7 . The results are displayed on Table 3. The labor share
of income (equivalently, real unit labor costs) does not appear to be a (sta-
tistically) relevant variable for explaining in‡ation dynamics. Furthermore,
the signs of in‡ation acceleration are consistent only with the APC. Still, the
diagnostic tests does not indicate any problems with the estimates.
   7
    Most papers in the recent literature on the NKPC have referred to labor’s share of
income as real unit labor costs. Our measure of labor share of income (equivalently, real
unit labor cost) corresponds to the GG measure of log-real unit cost as described by King
and Watson (2012), with the di¤erence that we applied the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) …lter
to get the deviaton from steady-state.

4    Empirical Evidence: Brazil (1996Q1–2012Q2)
     We extend the encompassing ADL Phillips curve [equations (1)–(2)] to
introduce the exchange rate, an important open-economy modelling feature.
    Including the exchange rate in the study of in‡ation dynamics is impor-
tant because the exchange rate allows additional channels for the transmis-
sion of monetary policy. In an open economy, the real exchange rate will
a¤ect the relative price between domestic and foreign goods, which in turn
will a¤ect both domestic and foreign demand for domestic goods, and hence
contribute to the aggregate-demand channel for the transmission of mone-
tary policy. There is also a direct exchange rate channel for the transmission
of monetary policy to in‡ation, in that the exchange rate a¤ects domestic
currency prices of imported …nal goods, which enter the consumer price index


                                      10
(CPI) and hence CPI in‡ation. Finally, there is an additional exchange rate
channel to in‡ation: the exchange rate will a¤ect the domestic currency prices
of imported intermediate inputs, a¤ecting the cost of domestically produced
goods, and hence domestic in‡ation (in‡ation in the prices of domestically
produced goods).
    In order to capture the importance of the exchange rate for in‡ation
dynamics we supplement the (extended) ADL Phillips curve [equation (2)]
with a ‘level’term in the real exchange rate gap (q t ):
                                                               p
                       X
                       m                  X
                                          n                    X
               t   =         s xt s   +         s    t s   +         s qt s   + Dt + " t ;   (4)
                       s=0                s=1                  s=0

where D t is a vector of intervention dummies.
    The level term can be interpreted as capturing the presence of intermedi-
ate imported goods as in McCallum and Nelson (2000), where all imports are
material inputs to the production process for domestically produced goods.
    In the case of Brazil the sample goes from 1996Q1 to 2012Q2. The in-
‡ation rate ( t ) is measured as the exclusion core in‡ation reported by the
Central Bank of Brazil8 . The output gap (xt ) is given by 400 times the log of
the quarterly real GDP seasonaly adjusted, detrended by the HP …lter. The
real exchange rate gap (qt ) is calculed as 400 times the log of the quarterly
average of monthly indexes of real e¤ective exchange rates, detrended by the
HP …lter.
    We start from the extended open-economy ADL Phillips curve [equa-
tion (4)]. Then, we reduce the extended ADL Phillips curve by sequential
elimination of regressors based on t-ratios of the parameters estimators. We
estimate the full model by OLS and then sequentially delete those regressors
with the smallest t-ratios, until the t-ratios are all greater than the threshold
  =2.9
    Table 4 shows that the selected model is composed by the …rst three lags
of the change in in‡ation, the current value of the level of the output gap, the
current value of the level of the real exchange rate and its lag of order four.
The diagnostic tests does not indicate any problems concerning autocorrela-
tion, conditional heteroscedasticity, normality, and regression speci…cation.
   8
     In the exclusion core in‡ation, food, energy and regulated & administered prices are
excluded from the measurement of in‡ation.
   9
     In addition the same assumptions that we made in the estimation for the U.S., for
Brazil we also employed two intervention dummies. One is "Lula" which tries to capture
the e¤ect of the election of President Lula on in‡ation (2002Q3– 2003Q1). The other
"Energy Crisis" which tries to capture the negative e¤ect of the energy crisis on the
output gap (2001Q3–2002Q1).

Table 4: Brazil ADL Phillips Curve using core in‡ation: 1996Q1 - 2012Q2


    Using equation (4) and comparing the values of tables 1 and 4, we observe
that all restrictions implied by the NKPC ( 1 = 0 , 2 < 0 , 3 = 4 = 0)
and the HPC ( 1 = 4 = 0 , 2 < 0 , 3 > 0) are rejected by the Brazilian
data. The SIPC gets one restriction right ( 1 > 0) and three wrong ( 2 < 0
and 3 = 4 = 0). The APC gets all restrictions right ( 1 > 0 , 2 = 0 , 3
, 4 < 0). Therefore, also in a small open economy like Brazil the best …t
for explaing in‡ation dynamics from 1996Q1–2012Q2 comes from the APC
model.
    We modi…ed the ADL Phillips curve by replacing the output gap with
the real marginal cost, proxied by the labor share of income 10 . The results

5    Concluding Remarks
     As yet there is no consensus on two key Phillips curves issues. First,
in‡ation expectations are forward-looking or backward-looking? If expec-
tations are forward-looking, future events (including changes in monetary
policy) can in‡uence the current in‡ation rate. If, instead, expectations
are backward-looking, in‡ation has inertia. Such inertia a¤ects the de-
sign of monetary policy. Second, what is a proper measure of in‡ationary
pressures— the output gap or the real marginal cost?
    In this paper we test Phillips curves using an ecompassing framework.
We conclude that the NKPC does not provide an useful description of the
in‡ation process in the cases of the U.S. and Brazil. The evidence presented
here rejects the restrictions implied by the NKPC, the HPC, and SIPC, but
does not reject those of the APC. We also conclude that the APC is the best
…tting model of in‡ation dynamics for those countries, at least for the sample
considered.
    Regarding the two fundamental Phillips curves issues, our results suggest
that in‡ation expectations are backward-looking and that the output gap is
a better measure of in‡ationary pressures than the real marginal cost.
