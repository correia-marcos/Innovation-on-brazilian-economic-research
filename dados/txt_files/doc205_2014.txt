           This paper analyzes the influence of school management in Portuguese and mathemat-
       ics skills of students in public and private schools. Using longitudinal microdata of GERES
       (2005-2008) and checked for unobservable characteristics, the results indicate that the man-
       agement variable - measured as a component of variables relating to the director answered
       by teachers - is significant to explain the students’ proficiency. The management has small
       but negative impact on proficiency in Portuguese and it has no significant impact in mathe-
       matics. Regarding to the individual effect of management variables, we observed that some
       of them - e.g. having full professional confidence in the director - have significant and pos-
       itive impact on Portuguese and math proficiencies. In addition, special attention from the
       director to the administrative rules positively impacts the Portuguese grades and director
       stimulate innovative activities has a positive impact on math proficiency.

1    Introduction
Access to a good educational system is crucial for the development of individuals and of the
nation. Most countries that grew at rates greater than or equal to Brazil’s present higher educa-
tional expansion rates than the Brazilian ones. The low educational level and the slow expansion
of the educational system in the country are the national development characteristics that dif-
ferentiate it from other processes of other Latin American and Asian countries with similar
incomes (Barros and Mendonça, 1997).
     More educated individuals have a lower propensity to commit crime, are less likely to be
unemployed and have better opportunities in the labor market. These benefits are extended to
the rest of society (Hanushek, 2002). For Barros and Mendonça (1995), individuals participate
in a process of generating and reproducing inequality that occurs in two steps. According to
the innate ability of individuals and resources invested in their preparation, at the end of the
first stage these individuals are at different levels, that is, they finish the first step at unequal
conditions. This first step is associated with childhood until adolescence, where the formation
of human capital of the individual occurs. Thus, the level of human capital is different according
to their (innate) heterogeneous skills and according to the resources invested in this individual.
The second step is linked to the labor market. The authors show that wage inequality in Brazil
could be reduced up to 50% if income differentials by education level were eliminated.
     Studies have found that students’ performance can be explained by an education production
function (EPF). In this function, the factors that determine the proficiency of the students can
be divided into three main groups: students’ individual and family characteristics, school’s
characteristics and the community’s characteristics (FELÍCIO and Fernandes, 2005). These
groups are treated as educational inputs that explain the proficiency of the students and the
quality of education. The education production function is specified as:

                                      At = f (Ft , St , Ot , εt )                                (1)
where At is the educational result, Ft is the vector of characteristics and the family background
accumulated over t time, St is the vector of school inputs and of teachers accumulated over t
time, Ot is the vector of other relevant inputs, such as factors of class, accumulated over t time,
and εt is the random error term at t time (Krueger, 1999; Hanushek, 2002; Todd and Wolpin,
2003)
    The Coleman Report (1966) initiated the debate and research on the relationship between
school attributes and school performance. In his report, Coleman et al. (1966) show that the
school environment of the child consists of many elements ranging from the table that the stu-
dent sits, the colleague next to him and the teacher is in front of the class. The most prominent
point in the study was the minimization of the role of the school with regards to inequality of
proficiency.
    From the Coleman Report several authors have sought to study and prove the existence
of positive relationships between the school supplies and school performance. However, not
all studies achieved the expected results and explanations have been proposed to justify the
weak relationship between the school and the students’ learning. Among them, that EPF is
concave, i.e. investments in school inputs benefit students’ learning only to some extent, after
this maximum point, more inputs do not affect the performance of the students. Another point
is that there are difficulties to find variables that indicate the quality of the school, therefor it
becomes difficult to capture the effect of the school in the students’ performance (FELÍCIO and
Fernandes, 2005).
    The studies began to address other characteristics that influence the students’ school per-

formance, without disregarding the role of the school, although small, its role could not be
forgotten. The main significant variables for explaining different learning levels of students are
socioeconomic status, gender, race, and education of parents.
    According to Barros and Mendonça (1997)), an improvement in the educational system
can be obtained by increasing volumes destined to education and/or the efficiency that they
are used. As in Brazil, education costs are high, therefore the inefficiency must be related to
how those resources are used, and one of the reasons for this educational inefficiency is school
management.
    The relationship between school management and educational performance has been em-
phasized in Brazil since the 1980s because of the process of re-democratization. There began
a process of diffusion of innovations in school management and this had different intensities
in different state education systems of Brazil, especially with regards to the direct transfer of
resources to the schools, election of Directors and collegiate implementation
    What actually happened inside the school was for a long time in the background and interest
in what makes a school more effective and if it can have an impact on educational determinant
began being investigated in Brazil, following the investigation that for some time was already
relevant in both the United States and in Europe (Xavier et al., 1994).
    Educational results are persistently below average, especially in developing countries, this
arouse interest about which are the inputs that affect children’s learning in school so that effec-
tive public policies be implemented. One of the hypotheses that exist to justify this difference
in levels of proficiency is regarding management practices.
    To understand the role of school managers, that is, the role of Directors, in the performance
of the students, it is possible to determine school management practices that can be applied in
schools with low academic performance. If the role of the Directors is really important, ways
to manage the schools in order to maximize student learning should be considered a priority in
educational discussions.
    And what is understood by management? According to Bloom et al. (2011), management is
a broad term that includes standardized procedures for control of production and even elements
related to the administrator’s characteristics. This complexity brings difficulties in measuring
management and assessing how the administration affects the results. Given that, the litera-
ture seeks to check if management practices can be universal or if efficiency is derived from
specificities of each organization and the environment in which they are inserted.
    Lück (2009) considers that school management encompasses not only the Director. The
author considers that a democratic management also includes the active participation of teach-
ers on co-leadership pedagogical responsibilities. According to Willms (2003) the quality of
leadership in school is a relevant factor in evaluating schools and thus their educational results.
    However, in research related to the field of education, there are few jobs that prioritize
school management as explanation for the proficiency of the students1 . Clark et al. (2009)
states that due to the difficulty of defining the quality of school management and, due to the
lack of high-quality data in which empirical strategies may be based, the literature on the in-
fluence of managers in the success of students is scarce. Thus, this work seeks to investigate
the influence of school management in Portuguese language and mathematics proficiency of
students from a GERES longitudinal microdata project, Estudo Longitudinal da Geração Es-
colar 2005. Considering the works of Lück (2009); Willms (2003) and the database available,
school management will be defined by the perception of teachers on school leadership, namely
the quality of the directors in the teachers’ perspective.
    The work is divided as follows: in addition to this introduction, the topic two discusses

theoretical referential about education and school management. The third topic introduces the
database used. The fourth topic the methodology is presented, in the fifth topic the analysis of
the results is carried out, and the sixth the final considerations are presented.


2        Literature
According to Lück (2000) school management is a dimension that aims to promote organiza-
tion, mobilization and articulation of both human and material conditions essential to school
educational processes that promote students’ learning. Souza (2006) states that the school
management is understood as a political process, and democratic management is the ability
of managers to use this power to act together for the development of the students.
     According to Tavares (2012), assuming that the school industry is relatively rigid in relation
to technology production function2 , a hypothesis to explain the difference in results between
schools with the same inputs is given by differences in the forms of management. The empirical
research of the EPF presented evidence that the elements of school management are linked to
educational results.
     It is important to separate the works that address research in developed countries and those
which address research in developing countries. Developed countries have already achieved
higher levels of progress and their education systems are more consolidated and mature, despite
still having room for improvement.
     Since the 1980s, studies in economics of education began to highlight the leading role of
managers. It was found in these studies that the role of directors as leaders would be critical
to the creation of conditions necessary for academic development of the students. To mea-
sure the “directors as leaders” various aspects and characteristics of managers were considered,
such as capacity to plan and coordinate staff, monitoring students and parental and community
involvement (Blank, 1987).
     In order to examine which attributes of educational leaders influence students’ learning,
Eberts and Stone (1988), observed a positive effect of the experience of directors, as well as
a positive association between years of teaching experience of directors and the performance
of students. However, the authors found negative correlation between university degrees of
directors and performance of students. According to the authors this would be explained by
the fact that the most qualified directors were being allocated to schools of worse quality. In
general, the investigators found that the behavior of directors influenced the performance of
the students. Among the activities developed by the directors, the instructional leadership and
conflict resolution influenced positively on the performance of students.
     Ballou and Podgursky (1995),examined the association between the characteristics of the
directors and their performance at work, evaluated by teachers and other members of the school.
The characteristics associated with a quality manager relate to monitoring the performance
of teachers, to recognizing the efforts of teachers and the other leadership dimensions. As
well as Eberts and Stone (1988), the authors found negative correlation between university
degrees of the directors and their performance. However, Ballou and Podgursky (1995) found
no correlation between experience and performance of the directors.
     According to Hoxby (1996) there is some indirect evidence relating to school management
and the performance of students, trade unions, for example, give public schools greater market
power, increase the amount of input, but reduces productivity. The characteristics of the school
principal and the form of entering this career are also linked to the results of proficiency, di-

rectors with experience in management positions exert positive influence on students’ grades.
Schools in which the directors were chosen by the teachers and parents or who entered through
public service exams offer better performance than the schools where the directors were nomi-
nated by administrative organs.
    The profile of a school manager is related to school performance, Béteille et al. (2011) point
out that the experience of a school director in management positions has positive impacts on
students’ grades. Student learning is greater in institutions in which the directors give greater
importance to the participation of teachers in elaborating the pedagogical plan and are more
open to suggestions from the school community.
    According to Coelli and Green (2012), the directors may affect the results of the students in
various ways. As leaders in the schools, they influence aspects such as supervision and retention
of teachers, introduction and development of pedagogic projects, discipline of students, and
allocation of students and teachers in classes.
    In Brazil, democratic management of public education was institutionalized with the Federal
Constitution of 1988 and since then, the school structure has undergone changes in its conjec-
ture, for it no longer was based on administration and went on to be based on the management
principles, which have more democratic characteristics. Educational management is determined
as indicated in the Lei de Diretrizes e Bases (LDB) 1996 3 . These guidelines established, in the
form of a law, the responsibilities of educational institutions and ensure the versatility of forms
of organization (Vieira, 2007).
    In recent years changes have occurred with regard to school management in Brazil, both at
the municipal level and the state level. The states are responsible for developing and executing
educational policies, taking into account national plans, and high school is its main assignment.
The municipalities have as their assignments early childhood education and are responsible for
developing the education system, incorporating national and state plans. However, these innova-
tions in management practices do not follow a central standard, state systems have implemented
these changes in management differently and with different speeds, which makes it difficult to
assess the impact on school performance (Xavier, Sobrinho, Marra, and Médici, 1994).
    For Xavier et al. (1994) quality management begins at the highest ranks and depends on
strategic cultural and technical changes so that it can function properly. The school must make
a high investment, however, quality should not be acquired at any cost, but adjusted to the needs
of users.
    According to Barros and Mendonça (1997) the board is also fundamental to school man-
agement, this is composed by the principal, representatives of the teachers and the school staff,
representative of the parents and students. The board serves to keep the objective function of the
school close to the community in which it operates, it participates in the school development
plan and serves to supervise and monitor its implementation by the director. The interaction
between parents and community members in school decisions strengthens the school-family
relationship, since the participation of faculty and staff allows them to feel more motivated, and
consequently, more engaged in school activities. A more democratic management, whose direc-
tors are more likely to listen to suggestions from school community and give more importance
to the participation of teachers in the pedagogical plan, can have a positive influence on student
performance.
    The task of managing is linked to educational leaders and it relies on them the practices
necessary to move from an educational system of repeating grades to a system of educational
excellence. The commitment of educational leaders is crucial to the strengthening of man-
agement programs. It is necessary that school directors have leadership training, teachers and
   3
       The 1988 Constitution and the 1996 LDB establish that education is as social right guaranteed to all Brazilians.

supervisors have training in elaborating development plans, teamwork techniques, daily routine
management and methodology, and troubleshooting.
    Analyzing indirectly the effect of school management, J. F. Soares (2004) states that the
teacher’s relationship with the director and the teachers’ perception of internal problems at
school are factors that have positive effects on the average level of proficiency of students.
The author considers such factors defining characteristics of a good teacher, however these
factors are intrinsically linked to managers and, therefore, somehow also define the quality of
the directors.
    T. M. Soares and Teixeira (2006) examine the performance of students according to three
profiles of school management - management, traditional and democratic. The authors use data
from the Evaluation Program of Basic Education of the Minas Gerais Educational Assessment
System (Programa de Avaliação da Educação Básica do Sistema Mineiro de Avaliação Ed-
ucacional) for the year 2002, that is, they worked with state schools of Minas Gerais. They
conclude that strongly democratic principles contribute not only to the better student perfor-
mance but also to fairness in relation to their socio-economic levels.
    Focusing on the practices of “good management”, Tavares (2012) analyzes the impact of a
pilot program of educational management in state schools of São Paulo. The author finds evi-
dence that there are positive and significant impacts on students’ grade in mathematics, arising
from the participation of the school in the school management program deployed in them. In
addition, these positive effects influence, especially students with great learning deficiencies.
Performance monitoring and goal setting, combined with the bonus policy for school teams are
the management practices that impact positively on the students’ results.
    The system for electing a director varies as to the requirements and qualifications that he or
she must satisfy; level of education, experience in the administrative area and time as a school
teacher are some of the most common. The teacher’s participation is also important for the
management of the school. The school must involve teachers in managerial meetings and not
designate them just to teach. Including faculty and staff in school decisions can make them feel
more motivated and engage more in school activities. However, most schools make the mistake
of disregarding teachers in the managerial aspect and this may cause a problem in the future,
because the investment and effort to include them later tends to be greater.


3    Database
The micro-data used in this work are from Project GERES - Geração Escolar (School Gener-
ation). The GERES is a project that accompanies students in a sample of schools during the
first four years of Elementary School it is, therefore, a longitudinal study which allows you
to keep track of student learning over time. The goals of this project are: i) to identify the
school characteristics that maximize student learning and minimize the impact of social back-
ground on learning; ii) to identify the school factors that decrease the likelihood of students
repeating grades; iii) to identify the characteristics of the school that reduce the probability of
absenteeism.
     GERES accompanied students from 2005 until 2008 through annual tests to estimate the
levels of proficiency in mathematics and Portuguese, students who in 2005 was in the first grade
of elementary school. In addition to the tests, questionnaires were also applied on teachers,
directors, parents and students in order to evaluate the effects of family and school factors on
learning. Sample schools are public and private, and are located in five major Brazilian cities -
Belo Horizonte (MG), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Campo Grande (MS), Salvador (BA) and Campinas
(SP). GERES was developed in partnership with the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais

     For this article, however, only data from students who participated in all five waves was
used. Since no school in Salvador was part of the last wave, students in this town were not
considered. Student who participated in the five waves of Portuguese were 5,792 and 5,813
students participated in five waves of mathematics. table 1 presents the number of students and
schools that were present in each wave.
     The first wave, diagnosis, was carried out in March 2005 and the second wave was carried
out in November 2005. Waves were also carried out in November 2006, 2007 and 2008. The
survey took care to distinguish “added school value” and “selection effect”, that is, students
who do not pass continue to be part of the sample if they remain in the same school or transfer
to schools that also form part of the sample, students who transferred to a school that is not part
of the sample are lost, which may represent a selection bias, because the school may present
a better performance not because it improved, but due to the exclusion of students with low
performance.
     Proficiency variables were estimated based on Item Response Theory (IRT), this allows,
for example, GERES students’ grades to be compared with grades estimated in the SAEB.
The socioeconomic variable consists of information about the mother’s schooling, the father’s
occupation and presence of goods at home, and it was also built based on IRT (T. M. Soares,
2005). The average value of this variable does not have a direct interpretation, however, one can
tell from the standard deviation that there is great variation among families. The other variables
are categorical, and can be seen in annex 1. As well as in Ballou and Podgursky (1995), the
management component of this work was built on questions answered by teachers about the
quality of the directors.
     Tables 2 and 3 present the variables used in the workplace and their descriptive statistics,
both for students who participated in the five waves of Portuguese (table 2) and for students
who participated in the five waves of mathematics (table 3):
     Tables 4 and 5 show the correlation matrices of the variables selection. Table 4 shows the
correlation between the variables of student proficiency in Portuguese and in table 5 is shown
the correlation between the variables of student proficiency in mathematics.

    Socioeconomic status and the professor having another job offer the greatest degree of cor-
relation with the grades of students in Portuguese language and in mathematics, both positives.
For the management component, the lowest correlation is with the titles of the professor, in the
two proficiencies. Non-correlated variables are gender of the student and age teacher, and race
of the student and sex of the teacher, both in mathematics. But the highest correlation variables
are age of the teacher and teacher’s experience, both in Portuguese language and mathematics.
Which makes sense, since usually with increasing age the years of teaching professionally also
increase.


4      Metodologia
The methodology used in this work involves estimation with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS),
Random Effects (RE), Fixed Effects (FE) with the objective of capturing the influence of man-
agement practices for Portuguese language and mathematics proficiency of the students.
   The model proposed in the OLS is as follows:

                                         Yit = α + β1 Ait + β2 Pi t + β3 Git + uit                                            (2)
    where Yit is the proficiency of student i in Portuguese in the year t and the math proficiency
of the student i in the year t, α is the constant of the model, Ait is the vector of characteristics of
the student, Pit is the vector of characteristics of teachers, Git is the management component,
and uit is the error term for the model.

                                                                 9
    Before estimating the regressions proposals, a main management component is built from
variables answered by teachers concerning the principal. The goal of factor analysis is to de-
scribe the original variability of a vector X in a smaller number of random variables m, called
common factors and that relate directly to the original vector X through a linear model. Ac-
cording to Mingoti (2005) one can transform the random vector X ∈ Rn into another vector
Y ∈ Rm , to m ≤ n projecting X in m orthogonal directions of most variance, the so-called
principal components. Such components are individually responsible for the variance of the ob-
servations; part of the variance of the data set is explained by a reduced number of components,
allowing disposal of what is remaining without loss of information5 . The two random vectors,
X and Y , have the same variance, however, vector Y is composed of non-correlated random
variables. After identifying the core components, the scores (numeric values) can be calcu-
lated for each sample element enabling the analysis through the usual statistical techniques.
The number of components can be determined, according to Henry Kaiser’s rule, where the
eigenvalues must be greater than 1.
    Using the panel provides more information, for it is composed of cross section information
and time information, and this causes it to have more variability, except for collinearity between
the variables, more degrees of freedom and greater efficiency of estimators. In the balanced
panel there is information for all individuals and for all periods of time. It is possible to treat
the problem of omitted variable, correlated or not with the explanatory variables.
    The problem of equation (2) is the possible correlation between the error uit and the explana-
tory variables, which invalidates the hypotheses of equation (3) and thus does not maintain the
causality relationship:

                               E(uit |Ai ) = 0; E(uit |Pi ) = 0; E(uit |Gi ) = 0                                   (3)
    The OLS model does not separate the error variance from the specific effect of management
variance. Therefore, if there are unobserved management effects, endogeneity might occur be-
cause there are omitted variables that the researcher cannot observe and with that, the estimates
become inconsistent and skewed6 (Wooldridge et al., 2006). If the Breusch Pagan test proves
the existence of unobserved effects, then one must use the random effects model (RE) or the
fixed effects model (FE), for they are able to treat this unobserved effect 7 . In the case of fixed
effects, the proposed equation considers the characteristics unobserved ci :

                                Yit = α + β1 Ait + β2 Pit + β3 Git + ci + uit                                      (4)
    The chance of identifying the model of equation (4) requires that the correlation between
explanatory variables (Ai , Pi , Gi ) and the error term (ui ) be picked up by an explanatory variable
that does not vary between years (ci ), i.e., E(uit |ci , Ai , Pi , Gi ) = 0. estimation by fixed effects,
the term ci is eliminated, resulting in the fixed effects estimator. The feasibility of using fixed
effects in the analysis is guaranteed by the fact that the questions analyzed are answered by
   5
      It is a great technique for linear dimension reduction, relative to the mean squared error.
   6
      The OLS estimator is the between estimator that uses the variation in time between each cross-section. To ver-
ify the presence of not-observed effects a Breusch Pagan (1980) is carried out, made from a Lagrangian multiplier
and has as a null hypothesis the non-existence of an unobserved effect.
    7
      To choose which model to use, the RE or the FE, one can make the Hausman test (1978), whose null hypothesis
is that the estimators are not systematically different. If one does not reject the null hypothesis, then the estimator
RE is consistent and efficient, while the FE estimator is consistently null, and RE estimator is consistent and
efficient, while the FE estimator is consistent only, then the RE is best suited. If you reject the null hypothesis,
then the RE estimator is inefficient as the FE is consistent, the latter being the more appropriate. The test has χ2
distribution with N degrees of freedom, where N is the number of estimated coefficients.

5        Results
5.1        Descriptive Analysis
Figure 1 shows the evolution of the proficiencies of Portuguese language and mathematics along
the waves. Given that proficiency in mathematics grows more than Portuguese, and consider-
ing that the proficiency scales in GERES are different8 , the analysis of the disciplines will be
conducted separately.

     Figure 2 shows the density of average proficiency. There is a greater concentration on the
performance of Portuguese language. In math grades are less concentrated. In Figure 3, the
evolution of the density of proficiencies during waves is apparent. In the tests applied in the
first year (waves 1 and 2), the students had their grades more concentrated mathematics. In the
three years following (waves 3, 4 and 5), the students’ proficiency in Portuguese becomes more
concentrated. Such behavior of proficiencies may be related to increased emphasis on learning

5.2   Empirical Analysis
Table 7 presents the composition of management components from the variables answered by
teachers. The component explains 80.39% of the total variance. This variance is considered
high (Mingoti, 2005) and the component may be considered a good index for the quality of
school management.
    Section 5.2 presents the results of the regressions estimated by Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS), Random Effects (RE), Fixed Effects (FE) for the previously described variables.
    The estimation by Ordinary Least Squares shows students’ proficiency without controlling
for unobserved effect. However, the Breusch Pagan test indicates the existence of unobserved

Thus, the methods of Random Effects and Fixed Effects are favored in the analysis. When
comparing the coefficients of the OLS, RE and FE models, one realizes that there is differ-
ence in magnitude between them, which corroborates the hypothesis that there is a bias of not
controlling for the unobserved effects.
     The Hausman test indicates the Fixed Effects model as the most appropriate, because it
rejected the null hypothesis and thus the RE estimator is inefficient while the FE is consistent.
This way, you can see that there are differences in the proficiencies of Portuguese language and
mathematics arising from management.
     The control variables and the non-management variables are as expected and observed in
literature. It is worth mentioning that the socioeconomic level variable (NSE) is significant
in all estimates, however, the fixed effects estimation it is excluded from the analysis because
we were not able to follow its evolution, since this information is only available for one year.
The control coefficients, with few exceptions, increased the coefficient, in absolute terms, if
comparing the OLS to the FE.
     The management component, if compared between OLS and FE, presents reduction in the
estimated coefficient. Thus, part of the change in proficiency that was attributed to management
was actually due to unobserved characteristics. These characteristics were overestimating the
impact of management. For mathematics, management impacts positively when there is no con-
trol of variables unobserved, however, when this is done, management is no longer significant.
For Portuguese language management had also positively impacted without the unobserved
control effects, but with control of fixed effects it started to have negative impact on students’
proficiency.
     The results indicate negative impact of school management on students’ proficiency in Por-
tuguese language and there is no impact on mathematics. As has been discussed, other articles
have already found a negative relationship between variables related to the directors and the
students’ proficiency (Eberts and Stone, 1988; Ballou and Podgursky, 1995; Clark et al., 2009).
In Brazil, Biondi and de Felı́cio (2007) found that the process by which the director assumes
the direction of the school has negative effect on the average performance of students in math-
ematics.
     However, this work presents some limitations. The management component is restricted due
to the difficulty of measuring school management. Coelli and Green (2012) arouse the atten-
tion on endogeneity and measurement errors in studies that base their analysis on the teachers’
perception about leadership and school conditions. The controversy about the effects of school
management on the student performance are found both in national and international litera-

ture. These mixed effects may occur due to differences between the results, controls or sample
characteristics (Clark et al., 2009).

     In order to check the robustness of the result to the management component we did a regres-
sion with fixed categorical variables that comprise the component effects. According to Table 9,
we can see that some management variables, when analyzed individually, had a positive impact
on students proficiency. Both Portuguese language and math, students whose teachers say they
have confidence in the director have higher scores than students whose teachers do not trust the
directors. Have a commitment to the school had a negative coefficient in the categories analyzed
in both disciplines.
     For Portuguese language, in addition to confidence, the variables related to administrative
rules and the maintenance of school also had a positive sign. This indicates that students whose
teachers agree or are neutral regarding the special attention of the director related to adminis-
trative rules and the maintenance of school had higher grades to those students whose teachers

    Moreover, in addition to aspects related to the commitment of the school, the fact that teach-
ers agree or be neutral in relation to the director stimulate innovative activities showed negative
signal for the proficiency of Portuguese. This variable is that it has increased participation in
the composition of the management variable is constructed as component (Table 7). So the fact
that variable have a significant and negative impact on the proficiency of Portuguese may have
influenced the negative outcome of the management component presented in Table 8.
    The other variables of management, namely, the director gives special attention to issues
related to student learning, I feel respected by the director and officers, teachers and other mem-
bers collaborate to school work well not have significant impact on the Portuguese proficiency.
    Mathematics, in turn, two other variables had significant and positive impact on the analysis,
innovative activities and aspects related to students learning. Thus, students whose teachers did
not disagree that the director encourages innovative activities had higher math grades to those

students whose teachers disagree with this statement. Likewise, students that teachers do not
disagree that the director gives special attention to issues related to students learning have higher
scores than those students that teachers disagree with this statement.
    However, some management variables also had a negative impact on math proficiency be-
yond the commitment of the school. Are the variables related to the aspect of school mainte-
nance and directors respect for the teachers. This implies that students whose teachers did not
disagree that the director gives special attention to issues related to school maintenance and/or
disagree with not being respected by the director showed lower grades to those students whose
teachers disagreed with one or both claims.
    The variables that highlight the attention of director for the aspects related to the admin-
istrative rules and the collaboration of principals, teachers and other school members to work
well had no significant impact on mathematics.

6    Conclusions
This project investigated the impact of school management variables on the educational perfor-
mance of Portuguese and mathematics students from public and private schools that participate
in the GERES project. In view of the difficulty of obtaining information relative to management,
there are few works with this objective and therefore studies with this focus gain relevance.
     Using a balanced longitudinal panel (from the GERES Project School Generation), esti-
mates were made controlling the unobserved characteristics at fixed effects method. The main
outcome of the work refers to the impact of school management component - measured as vari-
ables relating to principal answered by teachers - on students’ proficiency. Management has
little impact, but negative in Portuguese proficiency and in mathematics has no significant im-
pact. However, to check the impact of management, variables individually was observed and
some of these have significant and positive impact on Portuguese and math proficiencies. For
example, having full professional confidence in the director positively impacts both proficien-
cies, the director give special attention to aspects related to the administrative rules positively
impacts the note of Portuguese and director stimulate innovative activities has a positive impact
on math proficiency. It was also noted that the control of the unobserved skills is necessary in
order to make consistent estimates.
     The impact of management variables is not completely divergent from the results presented
in the pertaining literature. However this work presents some limitations. The management
component used is restricted, because there may be measurement errors of the true quality of
school management, since the analysis is made by teachers’ perception. It is also possible that

                                                             17
there is no negative causal relationship between school management and performance, since
even controlling for fixed effects there may be omitted variables.
    Even considering these limitations, it was found that the researched management variable is
significant to explain students’ proficiency in Portuguese. Since the variable has importance to
student learning, it should be studied in greater depth. Also one cannot forget the results since
there are examples in both national and international literature on school management-related
variables that impact negatively the performance of the students. That is, this work contributes
to advance the analysis working with a longitudinal database and filtering effects of students
fixed in time to examine the impact school managers participating in the GERES project on
students’ proficiency.
