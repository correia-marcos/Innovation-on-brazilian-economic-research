ABSTRACT: I document new evidence on the relationship between inflation and relative price
variability (RPV) using store-level data on prices in Brazil from 1989 to 2007. In brief, the linkage
grows stronger during periods of lower inflation rates. I divide the sample into two subsamples: from
1989 to 1993 (hyperinflation); and from 1995 to 2007 (low inflation). I study the distribution of
inflation at the most disaggregate level (brands), and I find strong support regarding the effect of
Plano Real in decreasing inflation variability almost immediately after its implementation. The size
and frequency of price changes also decreased right after the plan took place. The intramarket RPV
significantly increased with the rate of inflation, but I find marked differences between the two
inflationary scenarios. During hyperinflation, the relationship is roughly 70% of the magnitude during
lower inflation, i.e., the linkage is looser during hyperinflation. The impact of deflation (in absolute
terms) is weaker than the impact of positive inflation during hyperinflation, yet stronger during
lower inflation. I also document similar patterns aggregating brands into sectors and groups of
products. This paper highlights the importance of considering different inflation scenarios when
assessing inflation-related effects.

RESUMO: Este artigo documenta novas evidências sobre a relação entre inflação e variabilidade de
preços relativos (RPV) usando dados de preços no nível da loja no Brasil entre 1989 e 2007. Em
resumo, a ligação se fortalece durante períodos de taxas de inflação mais baixas. Eu divido a amostra
em duas subamostras: de 1989 a 1993 (hiperinflação) e de 1995 a 2007 (baixa inflação). Eu estudo a
distribuição da inflação no nível mais desagregado (marcas), e encontro evidências sobre o efeito do
Plano Real na redução da variabilidade da inflação quase imediatamente após a sua implementação.
O tamanho e a frequência das mudanças de preço também diminuíram logo após o plano. A RPV
intra-mercado aumentou significativamente com a taxa de inflação, mas eu encontro diferenças
marcantes entre os dois cenários inflacionários. Durante a hiperinflação, a relação é de
aproximadamente 70% da magnitude encontrada durante o período de inflação mais baixa, isto é, a
ligação é mais fraca durante a hiperinflação. O impacto de uma deflação (em termos absolutos) é
menor do que o impacto de uma inflação positiva durante a hiperinflação, porém mais forte durante
o período de inflação mais baixa. Eu também documento padrões semelhantes agregando marcas
em setores e grupos de produtos. Este artigo destaca a importância de se considerar diferentes
cenários de inflação ao avaliar impactos relacionados à inflação.

1     Introduction

Homogeneous goods are often sold at different prices across various stores. Firms also adjust
their prices in different amounts over time. When prices do not rise in tandem, demand shocks
and monetary policy have real economic effects. Understanding the sources of price rigidi-
ties and unsynchronized price adjustments is central to assessing welfare losses and designing
effective public policies.
Despite widespread evidence of a positive relationship between inflation and relative price vari-
ability (RPV), there is still room for studies regarding developing economies, especially studies
that address hyperinflationary episodes. This article addresses the issue through an examina-
tion of microdata from Brazil using almost 19 years of data including 5 years of hyperinflation.
The main question of this paper is as follows: Do inflation and intramarket inflation variability
have the same relationship during periods of hyperinflation and periods of low inflation? Using
store-level price quotes collected by the Fundação Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas (FIPE)
in the city of São Paulo, I find compelling evidence of marked differences between these two
scenarios.
The dataset comprises more than 6 million price quotes for 1,272 brands sold in 10,490 different
stores from January 1989 to June 2007. I divide the sample into two very different inflation-
ary regimes: (i) 1989–1993, when monthly inflation averaged 25.3% (hyperinflation), and (ii)
1995–2007, when monthly inflation averaged 0.6% (low inflation1 ).
I document the shape and structure of brand-level intramarket inflation for these two time
periods. The distribution of price changes is far from uniform or even symmetric. I find evidence
of persistent inflation dispersion among firms selling the same brand of good or service. The
kernel estimation function drastically collapses after the hyperinflation ended.
I find strong support that Plano Real decreased inflation dispersion immediately after its im-
plementation. The size and frequency of price changes also decrease right after the plan was
put into practice. There is no evidence of a transition path. The lower the level of aggregate
inflation, the lower the dispersion of price changes at the store level.
In both sample periods, inflation (in absolute terms) has a positive impact on intramarket
inflation variability. I perform fixed effects panel estimations considering two measures of RPV:
the standard deviation (SDP) of price changes across stores and the coefficient of variation (CV)
of price levels across stores.
The magnitude of the impact of inflation on RPV is stronger when measured by the SDP than
when measured by the CV. Both measures indicate the presence of a positive and significant
linkage, although the magnitude is roughly 70% weaker during hyperinflation. Higher levels
of inflation are normally associated with higher degrees of inflation variability, yet the link is
somewhat looser during the hyperinflation period.
   1
     I refer to the period between 1995–2007 as the low-inflation period. Keep in mind that Brazil exhibits
higher and more volatile inflation levels than do developed economies. I use the term “low-inflation period”
only to emphasize the difference between this period and the hyperinflation years.



                                                     1
During hyperinflation, the weaker impact of inflation on its variability results from the frequency
of price increases. When inflation is very high, most price changes are increases, thus narrowing
the observed inflation dispersion among all items. On the other hand, when inflation is low
and more stable, price decreases and price increases are almost equally likely, thus widening
inflation dispersion. This translates into a relatively higher impact of inflation on its dispersion
in my low-inflation sample.
Note that inflation dispersion is, in fact, higher during hyperinflation. My results indicate only
that the correlation between inflation and inflation dispersion is weaker during hyperinflation.
When inflation is extremely high, inflation dispersion is also high, but not as high as predicted
by their relationship during low inflation.
I also investigate the presence of asymmetric effects from negative and positive price movements
on RPV. The impact of deflation (in absolute terms) is weaker than the impact of positive
inflation during hyperinflation. In contrast, from 1995 to 2007, price decreases have a more
significant impact on RPV than price increases. I also document the same pattern when
analyzing different sectors and groups of brands.
A higher frequency of price decreases also helps to explain the greater impact of negative
price movements on inflation dispersion during the 1995–2007 period for each sector/group of
product. I find robust evidence of a structural change in the relationship between inflation and
RPV, depending on the inflationary regime. Although the effect is significant, I do not assume
any causal mechanism.
This paper contributes to a vast literature on tracking the relationship between inflation and
inflation variability. The novelty of this study’s empirical contribution is its rich and unprece-
dented dataset on store-level prices in Brazil, encompassing years of hyperinflation as well as
years of low inflation. I analyze more than 6 million price quotes taken from a period spanning
almost 19 years. The data included here is also extensive in terms of products (1,272 brands
of goods and services). I analyze a much larger dataset than Angelis (2012).
This paper closely relates to studies by Lach and Tsiddon (1992), Caglayan and Filiztekin
(2003), and Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005). Lach and Tsiddon (1992) is one of the first
empirical works based on microdata to investigate the relationship between inflation and RPV.2
The authors use data on 26 food items in Israel, at a time when inflation peaked at roughly
60% a year.
Lach and Tsiddon (1992) find a positive association, mainly driven by the expected component
of inflation. The authors also find evidence of unsynchronized price setting among firms, and
therefore advocate for some staggering in the way prices are set. They document that whenever
inflation is high, the distribution of real prices is not uniform or symmetric. My study strongly
supports their findings. I also document a positive relationship between RPV and inflation, as
well as an asymmetric inflation distribution during the years of hyperinflation in Brazil.
Caglayan and Filiztekin (2003) employ a similar approach, using price data on 22 food products
   2
     Hoomissen (1988) also investigates the impact of inflation on price dispersion. She highlights the role of
inflation in reducing the information content of prices, which translates into greater price dispersion.

in Turkey. They emphasize the importance of considering structural changes in inflation.3 Their
main conclusion is that the association between inflation and RPV is significantly weaker during
higher levels of inflation. I reach the same conclusion here.
The impact of inflation on its variability is stronger in the sample taken from 1995 to 2007 (low
inflation) in Brazil than in the sample taken from 1989 to 1993 (hyperinflation). When inflation
is low, price decreases are more likely, which widens the inflation distribution and translates
into a greater correlation between the level of inflation and its dispersion.
Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005) investigate price-setting behavior in Poland after the disso-
lution of the Soviet Union. This was a period of high inflation in the country (from 250% in
1990 to 18% in 1996). The authors highlight a positive relationship between RPV and the
frequency, size, and dispersion of price changes. They document a stronger effect of inflation
on RPV when the latter is measured by the SDP than when it is measured by the CV. I reach
the same conclusion using Brazilian data.
Price dispersion is a salient feature in both theoretical and empirical macroeconomic models.
The phenomenon is often associated with three nonexclusive sources: (i) differences in costs
and quality-related characteristics of products, (ii) menu costs, and (iii) imperfectly informed
consumers. The first relates to inherent differences in the location where a product is sold.
Stores may differ in terms of location, facilities, and other dimensions, a situation that results
in different prices for the same commodity – see Stigler (1961) and Gorodnichenko et al. (2018).
Moreover, when price readjustments are costly, unsynchronized price setting may arise across
firms – see Sheshinski and Weiss (1977) and Benabou (1988). Finally, search costs associated
with discovering the lowest-priced firm may also lead to price dispersion in equilibrium – see
Burdett and Judd (1983), Benabou (1992), and Rauh (2007).
As inflation increases, the range of prices for the same homogeneous good spreads, and the
informational content of nominal prices decreases. Higher inflation is thus often associated with
higher degrees of price-change variability, which is one of the social costs of inflation. There
is a relatively broad consensus regarding the presence of a positive link between inflation and
inflation variability. Nevertheless, some studies document an effect in the opposite direction,
leaving room for further investigation on the direction of the final impact.
Reinsdorf (1994) uses data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1980 to 1982 (Volcker
disinflation period) and finds that inflation and price dispersion may be negatively correlated.
Sheremirov (2015) also finds a negative relationship between price dispersion and inflation, but
the effect is driven entirely by the presence of temporary sales. The author finds a positive
relation for regular prices. Silver and Ioannidis (2001) find a similar negative relationship based
on intermarket data for 9 European countries.
The literature that investigates links between prices and their dispersion during high-inflation
scenarios includes Hoomissen (1988) and Lach and Tsiddon (1992) for Israel; Tommasi (1992)
for Argentina; Caglayan and Filiztekin (2003), Caglayan et al. (2008), and Baglan et al. (2016)
for Turkey; and Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005) for Poland. Among these countries, only

    Caraballo et al. (2006) analyze data on Spain and Argentina and document significant changes in the
relationship between inflation and RPV depending on the inflationary regime.

Argentina experienced hyperinflation similar to that experienced by Brazil from the 80s until
mid-90s. My dataset reflects considerably higher inflation variation than other studies.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the inflation environment in Brazil from
1989 to 2007. Section 3 presents the dataset and summarizes information on the frequency and
size of price adjustments during the covered period. Section 4 documents patterns of inflation
behavior at the brand level in different inflationary scenarios. Section 5 presents the econometric
estimation of the relationship between inflation and intramarket inflation variability. Finally,
Section 6 offers a conclusion.



2       Inflation environment

The data comprises two very different inflation scenarios in the Brazilian economy. From Jan-
uary 1989 to June 1994, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measured by FIPE rose 472,894,862%.
Annual inflation reached three digits, peaking at 2,490% in 1993. Monthly inflation peaked at
79.1% in March 1990. At a certain point, prices in Brazil rose close to 2% a day. A series of
economics plans attempted halt the chronic hyperinflation process.
An extensive set of unorthodox policies were tested, such as freezing prices and wages adjust-
ments by law and confiscating personal savings to prevent demand pressures on prices. From
1989 to 1993 all the plans failed. Brazil also changed currency four times during those years.
See Giambiagi et al. (2010) for an extensive description of the Brazilian economy.
It was only under the successful implementation of Plano Real in July 1994 that hyperinflation
was finally tamed in Brazil. The plan significantly altered inflation dynamics in the country,
finally controlling the explosive CPI path. The impact of Plano Real was immediate. Monthly
inflation went from 50.8% in June 1994 to 6.9% in July and 1.9% in August of the same year.
Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of the monthly CPI-FIPE during the sample years, as well as
the subsamples in Figure 1b (hyperinflation) and Figure 1c (low inflation rates). The vertical
line in Figure 1a marks the implementation of Plano Real in July 1994. My subsample division
excludes 1994.
Brazil underwent two very distinct inflation regimes during the sample period. From 1989 to
1993 annual inflation averaged 1,470%, whereas from 1995 to 2007 it averaged 7.1%.4 Monthly
inflation averages 25.3% from 1989 to 1993 and 0.6% from 1995 to 2007. In this paper, I explore
the differences inherent in each scenario.
I split the sample into two subsamples: hyperinflation (1989–1993) and low inflation (1995–2007).
This pragmatic division is possible only because Brazil has undergone two distinct inflationary
regimes. There is a clear structural break in the data. Because the range of data is significantly
large, the Brazilian case is especially suitable for analyzing inflation and inflation variability.
Brazil underwent one of the most prolonged periods of hyperinflation ever witnessed by a

    Note that, although significantly lower, inflation in Brazil runs at higher levels than that in developed
economies.

country, and to a certain extent this was due to the fact that the economy was severely indexed.
Indexation was probably the central component of Brazilian inflation. Almost all contracts were
automatically adjusted according to past inflation.
Through a spiral of adjustments, high past inflation contributed to even higher future inflation.
The key to taming escalating price increases was then to stop this cycle. Plano Real succeeded
by introducing a temporary index into the economy, the units of real value (Unidade Real de
Valor - URV).
The most crucial aspect of the plan was the creation of the URV. Prices were quoted in Cruzeiros
Reais (CR$) at that time, and by March 1994 the new index was introduced. The index had
daily fluctuations pegged to the US dollar. The URV acted as a unit of account for transactions.
All agents were encouraged to quote prices in CR$ and URV’s. Prices would rise in CR$,
but prices in URV’s would be much better behaved, because they were connected to a stable
currency.


                                                5
Consumers and sellers had three months to adapt to the new indexing and pricing processes.
Once prices in URV’s were stable, the new currency (Real - R$) was introduced. On July 1,
1994, all prices in Cruzeiros Reais were converted to Reais at the rate of R$ 1 to CR$ 2,750.
This mechanism made it possible to break once and for all the hyperinflation in Brazil. The
Real is still the official currency in the country until today.



3        Data

This paper uses the dataset for the CPI collected by FIPE. The data consists of monthly price
quotes at the store level for a variety of goods and services (100% in CPI weight). The original
dataset comprises 12,921,795 price quotations from January 1989 to June 2007. The dataset
covers the geographical area of the city of São Paulo, which corresponds to roughly 11% of the
total national GDP.5 Tracking the same good/service in the same store through time yields a
price trajectory. The cross-section dimension tracks the dispersion among different brands and
outlets.
The unit of interest is defined as a particular brand. Brands are set in the sample as a summary
of the product’s main characteristics, such as size, packing, material, etc. An aggregation of
one or more brands comprises the product definition in the CPI. For example, many brands of
soda, such as Coca-Cola, Guaraná, Fanta Uva, aggregate into the product level Soda, a part
of the group Foods and Beverages, with a weight of 1.2% in the total CPI. The CPI-FIPE is
published at the product level, which is the equivalent of the entry level items (ELIs) in the
United States. There is no brand substitution or sales flag in the sample.

indicates the implementation of Plano Real. Figure 2a illustrates the evolution of prices in R$
and Figure 2b presents the evolution of prices in log scale. These two figures show how Plano
Real affected individual price setting and inflation. They also illustrate how price dispersion is
a common feature in the data. Although the brand is completely homogeneous, its price differs
across stores in a given period of time.
The original dataset was treated to eliminate prices not in accordance with this paper’s purpose.
First, I drop all prices regulated by the government, because they obey particular rules of
readjustment. Products in this sector include water and sewer utilities, electricity, gasoline,
and prescription drugs, for instance. Regulated goods and services account for 502,463 price
quotes in the dataset, which correspond to 27.3% in CPI weight on average. This paper focuses
only on nonregulated prices.
I also exclude prices of rent, condo fee, and housekeeping services, because their methodology
of price quoting changed many times during the sample period. I also drop brands with fewer
than 10 price quotes per month, that is, fewer less than 10 stores selling the brand each month.
Because the focus is on price variability, I ensure a minimal threshold of quotations per brand.
The treated dataset corresponds to 51.9% of the original number of price quotes and 45.6% in
CPI weight. Table 1 presents the comparison between the original and treated dataset.

The treated sample encompasses 6,708,165 individual price quotes. A combination of brand
and outlet defines an item. Brands are sold in 10,490 different stores, which results in 216,944
different items. Each item has its own price trajectory. The treated dataset comprises informa-
tion about 1,272 brands. Most of the literature on inflation variability analyzes only a subset
of products, mostly food. For instance, Hoomissen (1988) considers only 13 goods, Lach and
Tsiddon (1992) analyze 26 food products, Reinsdorf (1994) addresses 65 food items, Konieczny
and Skrzypacz (2005) examine 52 goods, and Baglan et al. (2016) investigate 128 goods.
The dataset is also representative in terms of groups of products considered. The FIPE-CPI
basket is divided into 7 groups of products: (i) Housing, (ii) Food, (iii) Transportation, (iv) Per-
sonal expenses, (v) Healthcare, (vi) Apparel, (vii) Education. All 7 groups are represented in my
dataset, which is a somewhat unique feature of this study. Figure 3 presents the comparison
between the CPI weight (year 2000)6 and the sample weight. The groups Food and Personal
  6
     Weights in the CPI-FIPE are determined by Household Budget Surveys (Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar
[POF]). FIPE conducts the survey regularly to analyze the average consumption basket of a typical family in
São Paulo earning up to 20 minimum wages of income. I use the weights calculated by the POF 98/99 in this
study.

lated prices and rent explain most of the effect. Regulated prices in Transportation were also
dropped.

3.1    Summary statistics

In this subsection, I summarize the information on the probability and size of price changes for
the 1,272 brands in the sample. Let Pijt be the price of a brand i sold in outlet j at time t.
I first compute the average monthly frequency of price changes for each brand as the fraction
of the total number of pijt 6= pijt−1 to all nonmissing price observations between two periods t
and t − 1 (including zero price changes).
I combine data from items to products by a simple average. I then use the product-specific
FIPE-CPI weights to construct a measure of aggregate frequency ft . It is also possible to
decompose ft into the frequency of price increases (ft+ ) and decreases (ft− ). It follows that:
ft = ft+ + ft− .
I also investigate the size of price nonzero price changes ∆pt . I compute the absolute size of
                                                     |pit − pit−1 |
price changes at the store level level by ∆pijt =                   , whenever pijt 6= pijt−1 . Items
                                                           pit−1
are again aggregated into brands and products by a simple average and then weighted using
product-specific FIPE-CPI weights. Finally, I compute the size of price increases (∆p+         t ) and
                                             +           −

The two inflationary scenarios in my sample display marked differences regarding the frequency
and size of price adjustments. Table 2 summarizes the information on the frequency and size
of price changes. The average inflation rate from 1989 to 1993 is 25.3%. During hyperinflation
(1989 to 1993), an average of 80.3% of all prices changes every month. The frequency peaks at
93.9% in 1993; that is, prices are almost entirely flexible. Prices also may change more than
once per month, but my monthly dataset prevents me from observing such movements. It may
be the case that some stores changed prices more than once per month.
From 1989 to 1993, the majority of price movements are increases. The frequency of increases
is 74.6%, whereas the frequency of decreases is only 5.7%. Price decreases are no more than
7% of all price changes during hyperinflation. Although it is less frequent, some prices drop
each month during hyperinflation.
I do not find evidence of the frequency of price decreases converging to zero. Even during
hyperinflation, some prices are dropping every month in Brazil. Nevertheless, this behavior is
mainly observed in prices of food items, whereas prices of services present more rigidity (see
Araujo (2018) for a detailed discussion).
The monthly frequency of price changes drops drastically after Plano Real. During the lower-
inflation period (1995–2007), the average frequency of price changes is 37.5%. Not only do prices
change less often, but price decreases become more likely. From 1995 to 2007, price decreases

correspond to a share of roughly 43% of all price movements. The shift in the frequency of
price change occurs immediately after Plano Real. Figure 4a plots the monthly series of ft ,
ft+ , and ft− . I find no evidence of a transition period after the plan. Plano Real significantly
changed price setting in Brazil.

Figure 4b plots the time series for the absolute size of nonzero price changes. From 1989 to
1993, the average size is 27.8%, above the average inflation of 25.3%. The size of price increases
is 28.2% on average, whereas the size of price decreases is 8.2%. During hyperinflation, prices
often undergo changes – and changes of large magnitude. On the other hand, from 1995 to 2007,
the average size of price changes is 10.6%. The magnitude is larger than the average monthly
inflation in this period (0.6%). This gap results from the higher frequency of price decreases,
because the size of price increases and decreases are somewhat similar (8.2% vs. 10.2%).



4     The morphology of inflation

In this section, I focus on the shape and structure of the distribution of price changes (inflation
dispersion). This approach, rather than directly examining price level dispersion, has the
advantage of differencing out store-level effects, controlling for possible nonstationarities in
price levels, and facilitating aggregation of different products. See Lach and Tsiddon (1992). I
focus on heterogeneities in the rate of inflation across sellers of the same brand.
Define pijt as the price of a brand i in store j at time t. The rate of change in prices between t
and t − 1 is set as: πijt ≡ ln pijt − ln pijt−1 . The in-sample rate of inflation of a brand i among
                                                    1 P
all sellers is set by a simple average: πit =             πijt . Where Sit is the number of stores in
                                                   Sit j
which prices are observed (the number of two consecutive nonmissing observations).
In order to address the comprehensiveness of the sample, Figure 5 plots the comparison between

                                                 10
the official FIPE-CPI and a measure of aggregate inflation constructed using the sample brands
(πbt ). Brands are aggregated into n products using a simple average. A measure of aggregate
inflation is then obtained by weighting products by their correspondent FIPE weight

                                                  N

                                                  n=1
                                                              Snt i

Where Snt is the set of brands defining a product n in a month t (number of nonmissing
observations). Weights (ωnt ) are calculated by the Household Budget Survey (POF) conducted
by FIPE. I choose weights relative to the year 2000 POF and recalibrate them to always sum 1
every month. The counterfactual (πbt ) presented in Figures 5b and 5c correctly replicates CPI
patterns in both sample periods.
Although using different methodologies7 and different products, πbt properly reproduces the
behavior of the official CPI. The correlation coefficient is 0.99 from 1989 to 2007. In the
low-inflation sample, πbt is more volatile due to a larger contribution of food items. The coun-
terfactual inflation also replicates the drastic decrease in inflation immediately after Plano
Real.
I now focus on the morphology of inflation variability. Firms adjust prices in different amounts
each period, and this pattern is consistently present. Figure 6 displays the kernel estimates of
the inflation rate distribution pooled over brands (πit ). I split the sample into years and inflation
scenarios. The data clearly shows that the hypothesis of synchronized price adjustments does
not hold. Each market for a specific brand adjusts prices by a certain amount.
The link between inflation and the inflationary environment is also interesting. Figure 6a
presents the kernel estimates for the hyperinflation years, and Figure 6b presents the estimation
for the low rates of inflation years. During the 1989–1993 period, the kernel estimate exhibits
a higher degree of dispersion. The distribution is also leptokurtic and asymmetric. The size
of price adjustments is approximately 30% of monthly price increases. I find no evidence of
unified price adjustments during hyperinflation.
In contrast, during the 1995–2007 sample period, the kernel estimation is consistently more
symmetric around zero and exhibits noticeably less dispersion. The kernel distributions for all
years from 1995 to 2007 are surprisingly similar.
In order to illustrate the remarkable impact of Plano Real on the distribution of price ad-
justments, Figure 7 illustrates the density function for the years 1993 and 1994. Note the
concentration around 30% of price changes during 1993 in Figure 7a. The distribution of
inflation is mildly asymmetric to higher adjustment values.
Interestingly, the 1994 distribution is bimodal. This pattern results from the implementation
of Plano Real in the middle of the year, in July 1994. Figure 7b illustrates the monthly kernel
estimates of intramarket inflation for the year 1994. Note the bimodal pattern in the data,
with a transition month (July 1994), precisely when the plan was implemented.

Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the importance of Plano Real in controlling inflation and its dispersion
among the most individual-level price observations in the sample (brands). The plan not only
ended hyperinflation but significantly altered price-setting behavior as well. Once inflation is
lower, producers adjust prices less often and less dispersed in time. There is less dispersion in
inflation both between sellers of the same good and between sellers of different goods.

This section investigates the impact of inflation on the dispersion of price adjustments among
all firms selling the same brand of good/service (intramarket RPV). The interest lies in how the

first moment of inflation affects the second moment of its distribution, that is, how inflation
is linked to inflation variability. Following Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005), I focus on two
measures of inflation variability: the standard deviation of price changes and the coefficient of
variation of price levels. Define the standard deviation (SDPit ) of price changes across stores
as

                                         "                     #1/2

                                        Sit j

Where Sit is the number of two consecutive nonmissing price-change observations and πijt and
πit are in-sample inflation at the store and brand level, respectively. SDPit yields the evolution

                                               13
of the rates of price change around the average inflation rate across all sellers of a particular
brand, the cross-sectional variance of inflation.
In addition, define the coefficient of variation (CVit ) of price levels across stores as

                                         "             2       #1/2

                                        Sit j    pit

Where pit is the average price level of a brand i across stores at time t. The coefficient (CVit )
accounts for contemporaneous discrepancies between the price of the same brand across all of
its sellers. Following Konieczny and Skrzypacz (2005), I work with both measures of price
variability.
One imperfect aggregate measure of price-change dispersion is set by combining brands into
products by a simple average and then using CPI weights to compute an aggregate index for
both measures of variability (SP D and CV ). Following Alvarez et al. (2011), Figure 8 plots the
aggregate measures alongside monthly CPI-FIPE. The correlation coefficient is 0.94 for SPD
and 0.87 for CV. Note that during the hyperinflation period in Brazil, RPV was significantly
higher. Higher levels of inflation widen the inflation variability range under both measures.

of the standard deviation of price changes, and Figures 9c and 9d for the coefficient of varia-
tion of price levels. The distribution of inflation variability is quite different between the two
inflationary scenarios. For both measures, the relationship does not appear to be symmetric
around zero.

5.1    Fixed effects panel

To estimate the effect of inflation on inflation variability, I run fixed effects panels regressions
with both measures of dispersion (SPD and CV) as dependent variables. I use two different
approaches: I estimate the impact of the absolute value of inflation and I also split inflation
into the absolute value of positive and negative movements to highlight the importance of
asymmetric impacts. The estimation procedure is defined as

The hypothesis of a positive relationship between inflation and inflation variability finds strong
support in the Brazilian data. I find evidence of a significant and positive correlation between
inflation and inflation variability captured by the linear coefficient. Considering all 19 years
of the sample, the linear coefficient on the absolute value of inflation indicates an effect of
0.345 in magnitude for SPD and 0.306 in magnitude for CV. The magnitude of the impact of
inflation on RPV is stronger when measured by SDP than when measured by CV. Konieczny
and Skrzypacz (2005) reach the same conclusion.
The overall degree of association between inflation and RPV is weaker during the hyperinflation
years. The interstore inflation variability significantly increases with the rate of inflation,
but the relationship is somewhat looser during hyperinflation. Considering Equation (1), the
coefficient β is 0.314 from 1989 to 1993 and 0.448 from 1995 to 2007. The strength of the linear
relationship is roughly 70% weaker during the years hyperinflation in Brazil (or, equivalently,
40% stronger during the low-inflation sample).
A similar conclusion is reached in Equation (3), where the coefficient β is also roughly 70%
weaker comparing hyperinflation to low inflation (0.221 vs. 0.304). Both results are statistically
significant at the 5% confidence level. The inflationary regime thus impacts the strength of
the relationship. This result is in line with Caglayan and Filiztekin (2003), who also report
evidence on a significantly lower association between inflation and inflation variability during
high-inflation years in Turkey.
The looser link between inflation and RPV during hyperinflation is explained by the higher
frequency of price increases during that period. When inflation is high, most price changes are
price increases, which narrows inflation dispersion at the brand level. Thus, the relationship
between inflation and its dispersion is weaker during these years.


                                                     16
Nevertheless, after Plano Real, price decreases are almost as likely as price increases, which
widens price-change dispersion in the data and increases the impact of inflation on it. Note
that price changes dispersion is higher during hyperinflation than during low inflation. The
point is that the impact of inflation on RPV is relatively higher during low inflation because for
low inflation levels, there is higher inflation dispersion due to the presence of price decreases.
I also find evidence of asymmetric effects. Deflation, in absolute terms, has a higher impact
on RPV considering both RPV measures during the 1995–2007 sample. During lower levels of
inflation in Brazil, price decreases contribute marginally more to price dispersion than do price
increases. From Equation (2) 1995–2007 sample period, the impact of πit− is 0.518 against
0.389 of πit+ . From Equation (4), during the same low-inflation sample period, the impacts are,
respectively, 0.462 and 0.345.
In contrast, during hyperinflation, because price decreases are less frequent, the effect of πit−
is weaker than the effect of πit+ , yet positive and significant. Even during hyperinflation, some
prices (mostly for food items) drop every month and this impacts overall inflation variability.
Tommasi (1992) reaches the same conclusion.
To gain further insight into the importance of inflation in price adjustment variability, I per-
form a simple least squared estimation on intramarket data individually for each of the 221
months in the sample. Table 4 presents evidence on a structural change in the relationship
between inflation and RPV. During hyperinflationary episodes, the relationship is significantly
lower. The additional exercise enables for time-varying effects without imposing any timing
for breakpoints in the sample, thus allowing for an investigation of the structural change. The
estimation procedure is set as


                    SPDit = λit + βt |πit | + it ,        for each t = 2, 3, ..., 222        (5)


                     CVit = λit + βt |πit | + it ,        for each t = 2, 3, ..., 222        (6)

Where λit is the intercept of the regression for each month. I focus on the time evolution of
βt . Figure 10 plots the OLS results for all months in the sample. A major structural change
is clearly evident in July 1994, precisely when Plano Real was implemented. The shift is clear,
and both coefficients – considering SDP and CV as the dependent variable – display a similar
timing of breakpoints.
Once the hyperinflation spiral was tamed, the structure of the relationship between inflation
and inflation variability changed. I confirm a higher impact of inflation on RPV for both SDP
and CV during low inflation. The link between inflation and inflation variability was looser
during the hyperinflation years. Once again, I find no evidence of a transition period.
I also document the estimation results of β, β1 , and β2 based on sectors and groups of brands.
The estimation results are displayed in Table ??. I aggregate products into three sectors:
Services, Industrial goods, and Food at home. I follow the methodology of the Brazilian Central
Bank (BCB) to aggregate products. This aggregation is common in the literature as well. I

also present the estimation for products in each of the 7 groups of products in the CPI-FIPE,
namely Housing, Food, Transportation, Personal expenses, Healthcare, Apparel, and Education.
All sectors and groups associated with the 1,272 brands confirm the same aggregate empirical
result: inflation and inflation variability present a significant positive relationship, and this link
is stronger during low inflation than during hyperinflation. I also document asymmetries for
upward and downward price movements.
It may not be the case that all goods and services will be affected to the same degree by varia-
tions in inflation. It is possible that, due to the purchase frequency or relative expensiveness of
brands, price adjustments dispersion will vary across brands. Although different categories of
brands are similar in terms of the impact’s significance and direction, some differences appear
across these categories. The magnitude of the impact of inflation is stronger for Services.
Food at home items, on the other hand, present a weaker relationship, which is probably due
to a higher incidence of supply shocks (price decreases). Regarding the division of products
in groups, the RPV of Healthcare and Education brands are strongly correlated to inflation.
Prices are stickier in both groups, so unsynchronized timing of adjustments also affects the link.
The coefficient is also high in Apparel.
In short, the empirical evidence suggests a looser link between inflation and inflation variabil-
ity during the Brazilian hyperinflation years. Inflation drives a wedge into the informational
content of nominal prices, causing persistent distorting impacts on relative price adjustments.
Nonetheless, when inflation is at skyrocketing levels, as in the Brazilian economy in the mid-
80s and mid-90s, firms will change prices according to sources of information other than price
movements among their competitors. High inflation distorts the channel through which infla-
tion affects relative price variability.

6     Concluding remarks

This paper investigates patterns of price-change variability across firms selling the same ho-
mogeneous brand using Brazilian microdata from 1989 to 2007. I find evidence of a different
relationship between relative price variability and inflation during hyperinflation and lower
levels of inflation at the microeconomic level. The link (in magnitude) during hyperinflation
is roughly 70% of the magnitude during low inflation. I also find asymmetric impacts from
deflation and positive inflation.
I document the morphology of inflation variability at the brand level across time. I find evidence
of an asymmetric and leptokurtic kernel density function during the years of hyperinflation.
The distribution is more symmetric and concentrated around lower values of inflation during the
1995–2007 period. I find no evidence of a transitional period. The density function on inflation
instantaneously adjusted to a new pattern once Plano Real was implemented in July 1994. I
also provide a set of summary statistics regarding the frequency and size of price adjustments,
which also highlight the substantial impact of the plan on price-setting behavior in Brazil.
The empirical results obtained in this paper indicate a positive relationship between inflation
and intramarket inflation variability. Through a fixed effects panel estimation, I find compelling
evidence of a significantly weaker association between inflation and RPV during hyperinflation.
Higher levels of inflation are associated with higher inflation variability, but the relationship is
somewhat looser during hyperinflation, which relates to the higher frequency of price increases
during this period.
The impact of deflation (in absolute terms) is weaker than the impact of positive inflation during
hyperinflation, yet stronger during low inflation. The magnitude of the impact of inflation on
RPV is stronger when measured by SDP than when measured by CV. The empirical evidence
indicates different inflation-RPV links depending on the inflationary environment.
Despite the extensive empirical evidence on the relationship between inflation and inflation
variability, there is still room for research on developing countries, especially during hyperin-
flation. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing a unique dataset on more than
6 million store-level prices encompassing 5 years of hyperinflation in Brazil. The data is also
extensive in terms of products. I analyze data on 1,272 brands of goods and services from 1989
to 2007 (almost 19 years). The paper provides further evidence highlighting the importance of
considering different inflation scenarios when assessing inflation-related effects.
