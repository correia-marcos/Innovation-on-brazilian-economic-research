A partir de um painel com informações cruzadas de setores econômicos e grupos ocupacionais, o trabalho
compara a relação entre salários e produtividade do trabalho para diversas categorias de ocupados no
Brasil e nos Estados Unidos, entre 1983 e 2013. Primeiramente, as análises destacam em que medida o
equilíbrio entre salários e produtividade do trabalho está relacionado ao estágio de desenvolvimento
econômico. Os salários nos Estados Unidos têm se mostrado mais associados à produtividade do trabalho,
enquanto que o Brasil tem passado por diversos ciclos econômicos em que o rendimento cresce
inicialmente muito mais rápido que a produtividade, mas cai repentinamente nos anos subsequentes. Em
seguida, as análises estimam o impacto das características ocupacionais sobre a relação entre salário e
produtividade do trabalho, destacando como a igualdade entre os diferenciais de renda e produtividade é
válida para algumas categorias, mas não para outras.

Using a matched industry-occupation panel data, the study compares the relationship between wages and
labor productivity for different categories of workers in Brazil and in the U.S. from 1983 to 2013. Firstly,
the analyses highlight to what extent the equilibrium between wages and productivity is related to the
degree of economic development. Wages in the U.S. has shown to be more attached to labor productivity,
while Brazil has experienced several economic cycles were average earnings grew initially much faster
than labor productivity, suddenly falling down in the subsequent years. Secondly, analyses estimate the
impact of occupational characteristics on the relation between productivity and wages, highighting how
wage differentials, in fact, match productivity differentials for certain social groups, while for others they
do not.

   1. Introduction
The relation between wages and labor productivity has been a source of substantial controversy. Classic
labor economic theory assumes that workers receive a salary equal to their marginal labor productivity,
once labor market is perfectly competitive, this means, labor demand equals labor supply. Nonetheless,
imperfect competition, which are triggered, for example, by informational asymmetries and institutional
factors, creates wedges between average productivity and average worker compensation (Manning,
2010). As a result, employers or workers can get rents from an existing employment relationship.
Alternative views of wage formation also emphasize the role of occupational and industry characteristics,
human capital formation, adjustment costs, erroneous expectations, or even discrimination that can make
wages deviate substantially from labor productivity (Ilmakunnas & Maliranta, 2005).
The first aspect in this analysis of labor market efficiency is to understand to what extent the equilibrium
between wages and productivity is related to the degree of economic development. Comparing sub-
Saharan countries, Biesebroeck (2011) indicated that the equality between wages and marginal
productivity holds in the most developed country, but not in the least developed country. Biesebroeck
(2005) also investigated the effectiveness of labor markets in several African countries and indicated that
the reallocation mechanism is less effective than in the United States (U.S.). In the U.S., between the
1970s and the 2000s wages increased at approximately the same pace of labor productivity, which more
than double in the period (Feldstein, 2008). In Brazil, wages increased remarkably in the 2000s, although
labor productivity had with few changes in most economic sectors, except for the technological revolution
in the agricultural sector (Maia & Menezes, 2014).
A second important aspect is to determine the extent to which occupational characteristics are rewarded
differently from their marginal productivity. Hellerstein et al. (1996) and Sakamoto & Kim (2014)
compared relative productivity and relative wages for various groups of workers in the U.S.. Both studies
highighted how, for certain social groups,wage differentials, in fact, match productivity differentials,
while for others they do not. Hellerstein et al. (1996), for example, highlight that the relative wages of
prime-aged workers (aged 35-54) and older workers (aged 55 and over) are significantly higher than
estimated productivity differentials, especially for the later group. Sakamoto & Kim (2014) higlighted the
substantial overpayment of college degree workers and managers, which means higher returns on wages
than on labor productivity. Moreover, while professionals have a large positive wage premium, blue-
collars have a significant negative premium. The authors then suggest that the labor market reward
includes many noncompetitive but institutionalized employment relations that deviate substantially from
the perfectly competitive economy of idealized models.
This study analyzes the relationship between wages and productivity in Brazil, making a comparison with
the U.S.. The paper has two specific aims: i) to compare the dynamics of wages and labor productivity in
both countries, reinforcing the idea that equality does not necessarily hold for less developed countries; ii)
to estimate the impact of occupational characteristics on the relation between productivity and wages,
examining which groups are rewarded more equally. The characteristics used in this analysis are
occupation, education, age, education, sex and race. Brazil and the U.S. provide an interesting
comparison, not only because they are the most representative developing and developed economies of
America, but also because they experienced substantial economic changes in recent decades.
Results are based on the dynamics of the relative wages, defined in this study as a ratio between average
wages and labor productivity. Empirical analysis of the relationship between wage and productivity is
difficult, since the productivity of individuals is not observed, although their wages can be reasonably
well measured in household surveys. However, if the individuals are aggregated to the industry level, the
relation between productivity and wage should still hold. The panel data used in this analysis contain two
hierarchical levels for the cross-section units (industry sectors and occupational groups) and time series
units for the period between 1983 and 2013.

   1. Historical background
Brazil and the United States (U.S.) presented remarkable, albeit divergent, trends in the dynamics of
wages and labor productivity. After a period experiencing a huge economic growth of 8.4 percent per
year in the 1970s, debt crisis in early-1980s introduced a long period of high inflation and low and
unsteady growth in this country (Hermann, 2005). In the 1990s, Brazil reached success controlling
hyperinflation, but some unpopular economic reforms brought additional difficulties to the Brazilian labor
market, contributing to increase unemployment, informality and to constrict real wages growth (BID,
2004). Several international crises, such as the Mexican crisis in 1994, Asian in 1997 and Russian in 1998
also contributed to the unsatisfactory economic dynamics in Brazil (Galbraith, 2010). This country
recovered the potential of economic growth in the 2000s, largely due to increasing prices of commodities
and depreciation of its national currency. Indeed, the country showed strength in the last world economic
crisis in late-2000s, exhibiting a better performance than many developed economies.
Meanwhile, the U.S. experienced contradictory dynamics of economic growth. Their most unstable
period occurred in the 1970s, when the two oil-price shocks were responsible for periods of severe
recessions (Eichengreen, 2004). Since then, the U.S. maintained a sustainable economic growth, reaching
3.3 percent per year in the 1980s and 3.4 percent per year in the 1990s, in spite of short periods of
economic crises, such as savings and loan crisis in the early 1990s and dot com crisis in 2001 (Caldentey,
Titelman, & Pineda, 2009). But the financial crises in the late-2000s affected intensively the developed
economies, especially the US. During the worst periods of the subprime crisis, initiated in 2007, the
economic growth of the main developing countries overcame that of the developed ones. Unemployment
grew remarkably and wages dropped fast for most occupational groups.
Despite recent improvements in average wages, well-paid jobs that demand a high degree of expertise and
training is relatively rare in the Brazilian occupational structure, which is still characterized by low-paid
manual positions in agriculture and in the service sectors of low productivity (Maia & Sakamoto, 2015).
Economic growth in the U.S. has been more intensive in the use of skilled occupations, which would
justify the larger prevalence of skilled professionals and technicians in this country, a group that
characterizes the middle and top classes in developed capitalist societies (Acemoglu & Autor, 2010).
The low qualification of the Brazilian labor force also limits the productivity gains, a main determinant of
income, quality of employment and socio-economic development (ILO, 2004). Despite some
improvements in recent decades, the educational attainment of the Brazilian labor force is still very low
and the advances are having few or now impacts on labor productivity (Barbosa Filho, Pessôa, & Veloso,
2010). The large supply of low-skilled and low-wage workers in Brazil also tends to squeeze wages in
occupations at the bottom of the occupational structure and contribute to the low level of average
productivity.
Economic growth and improvements in labor productivity would be essential to generate better
opportunities of income and employment. However, the most significant changes observed in recent
decades in Brazil are reported to be the significant increase in agricultural productivity and the reduction
in the share of agricultural workers. This dynamics reflects, above all, (i) the advance of new and modern
agriculture in the Midwest and Northern regions and (ii) the intergenerational mobility of rural workers:
young workers leaving their rural homes in search of new opportunities of income and employment in the
urban areas (C. S. Sakamoto & Maia, 2012).

3. Empirical framework
       3.1.Data source
The comparison between the dynamics of the gross value added (GVA) in Brazil and in the U.S. from
1983 to 2013 was based on time series of National Accounts provided by World Data Bank (WDB)1 and
United Nation Statistical Division (UNSD)2. We also used labor market information provided by
microdata of PNAD (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios), sponsored by IBGE (Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística), and microdata of CPS (Current Population Survey), sponsored by
BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics)3.
Although the dynamics of the GVA and labor earnings provide useful information to identify trends in the
distribution of wage and profits in the labor market, it must be highlighted that wages and GVA may not
be directly comparable in a specific point in time, since they are based on distinct methodologies (Barros
et al., 2007; Hoffmann & Ney, 2008). Earnings in household surveys tend to be under-reported, as well as
it is very difficult to measure some types of labor benefits. Differences may be more expressive in Brazil,
where wages are based on monthly estimates (in the U.S. they are yearly estimates), which may be
subjected to seasonality and periods of high volatility.
Annual earnings in the American CPS were divided by 12 to be comparable with the Brazilian monthly
values of PNAD. Brazilian and American nominal labor earnings were deflated to constant values of July
2013 using the INPC (Índice Natiocional de Preços ao Consumidor) in Brazil and the CPI (Consumer
Price Index) in the U.S.. Subsequently, Brazilian wages were converted to PPP (Purchasing Power Parity)
dollars based on the conversion factor provided by WDB4. Similar procedures were adopted to convert
current values of GVA to PPP values of July 2013: using first the GDP deflator and second, just for
Brazil, the PPP conversion factor. PPP is both a currency convertor and a spatial price deflator.
Economic activities were classified according to the main groups suggested by the UNSD: AB)
Agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing; CE) mining and utilities (electricity, gas and water supply); D)
, manufacturing; F) construction; GH) wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels; I) transport, storage
and communication; GP) other activities (financial intermediation, real state, renting, business activities,
public administration, defense, education, health, social work, social services, personal activities, private
households and others services).
Occupational codes of PNAD and CPS were aggregated into 20 occupational groups (see Table 1).
According to the analytical convenience, these 20 two-digit occupational groups can also be analyzed into
6 one-digit occupational groups: 1) Managers; 2) Professionals; 3) Specialists; 4) Sales and Laborers; 5)
Low Services; 6) Farming.

 In both surveys, employed has been considered that with 16 years of age or older who, during the reference week (a) did any
work at all (for at least 1 hour) as paid employee; worked in his own businesses, profession, or on his own farm; or worked 15
hours or more as unpaid worker in an enterprise operated by a family member or (b) was not working, but who had a job or
business from which he was temporarily absent (BLS, 2002). Unemployed has been considered that who was not employed
during the reference week and had made specific efforts to find an employment some time during the 4-week period ending
with the reference week.

   3.2.Relative wages and the occupational premium
The relative wage was defined as the ratio between average labor earnings and average productivity. The
relative wage W for the h-th occupational group in the i-th economic sector is given by:
        Yhi Lhi
Whi                                                                                             (1)
        GVAi Li
Where Y is the total labor earnings, L is the total employed population and GVA is the total GVA. This
means that W represents the relation between the average earnings of an occupational group and the
average productivity in each economic sector. Due to limited available data, analysis was restricted the 20
two-digit occupational groups and 6 economic sectors provided by UNSD. This means that there were
120 relative wages computed for each year, in Brazil and in the U.S..

For analytical simplicity, the average relative wage of the occupational group h can also be computed.
This statistic represents the weighted average relative wage for the h-th occupational group among the
economic sectors, and can be computed as:

Where k is the total number of economic sectors.
The relative wage W can be determined by several factors. For example, occupations that are more
productive, i.e., that contribute more than others to GVA, tend to have higher wages in their respective
economics sectors. The level of education and the years of work experience, for example, tend to affect
productivity and, thus, relative wages. These factors can be observed through proxies given by, for
example, the years of education and age. But there are other important factors that are not easily
observable. For example, the demand and supply of jobs and institutional aspects, such as minimum wage
and other labor compensations, that may differently affect the relation between wages and productivity
between occupational groups.
In order to control for socioeconomic characteristics that also affect relative wages, one regression model
was fitted by ordinary least squares for each country. Estimates were based on a panel data with two
hierarchical levels for the cross-section units (level one defined by 6 economic sectors, and level two
defined by 20 two-digit occupational groups) and 31 time series units (from 1983 to 2013)5. The
dependent variable in both models was the logarithm (log) of relative wage. In other words, the models
were given by:
                       p                   5                                  5

Where the subscript h=1,..,20 is the h-th occupational group, i=1..6 is the i-th economic sector, t=0..30 is
the time period. The variable X jhit is the share (proportion, ranging from 0 to 1) of the j-th socioeconomic
group in the occupational group h, economic sector i and year t; Occn is the share of the n-th
occupational group; year is the time period (year ranging from 30 for 1983 to 0 for 2013), and e is the
unpredicted error. The coefficients β express the variation in the log relative wage given one percentage
variation in X,  express the variation due to one percentage variation in the share of the n-th occupational
group (sales and laborers used as reference), and the coefficients  represent changes in these later
relations across the years. Finally, the parameters  i representing the unobservable heterogeneity among
the economic sectors are controlled by fixed effects.
We considered the following explanatory factors to control socioeconomic characteristics:
        i.       Education: the share of workers with less than secondary diploma (reference), less than
                 college diploma (Less than Superior) and with superior diploma or more (Superior or more);
       ii.       Age: the share of workers between 16 and 24 years old (reference), 30 and 49 years (30-49)
                 and 50 years or older (50 or more);
     iii.        Race: the share of workers who reported to be white (White), black (Black) and other
                 race/color (reference – brown, Asian, Indian, among others);
     iv.         Gender: the share of women (Female);
Besides theoretical adherence to applied studies of social inequality, the definition of these variables was
also based on the availability of information provided simultaneously by the American and Brazilian

 Besides the absence of data for PNAD in the years 1991, 1994, 2000, and 2010, the sample used in the multiple regression

household surveys. Since the dependent variable is the log of relative wage and the independent variables
are the share of each group (proportion ranging from 0 to 1), the coefficients represent the percentage
variation in the relative wage due to one percentage point increase in the share of a respective group.


4. Results
   4.1.The dynamics of wages and productivity
Figure 1 give a snapshot of the strong relation between labor productivity and average wage. The average
wages of the economic sectors (in US$ PPP) are represented in the vertical axis and the labor
productivities (also in US$ PPP) are represented in the horizontal axis. The areas of the circles are
proportional to the number of workers in each economic sector, within each country separately. The
sector Mining and Utilities (CE) is not represented in 2013, since its unusual labor productivity in this
year would make visual comparison difficult. Labor productivity in this sector is intrinsically related to
the price of commodities, which grew unexpectedly in the late 2000, making GVA per worker soar to 21
thousand per worker in Brazil (8 times higher than the national average) and 25,000 per worker in the
U.S. (2.5 times higher than the national average). Nevertheless, the number of workers in this sector was
not representative: 0.8% of the working population in Brazil and 1.6% in the U.S.

The sectors of Agriculture (AB), Construction and Wholesale (F), Retail Trade, Restaurants and Hotels
(GH) present the lowest labor productivities and average wages, in both countries. On the other hand, the
sectors of Manufacturing (D), Transport, Storage and Communication (I), Mining and Utilities (CE) and
Other Activities (JP) present the highest labor productivities and average wages. The former sectors (AB,
F and GH) are more representative in Brazil (42% in 2013, against 29% in the U.S.) and the later sectors
(D, CE, I and JP), especially Other Activities (JP), in the U.S. (71% in 2013, against 58% in Brazil).
The dashed lines, which represent the linear trend between labor productivity and average wages,
highlight how average wages tend to be relatively higher than labor productivity in some economic
sectors – particularly, Other Activities (JP) – and lower in others – particularly, Agriculture (AB). Several
factors help to explain differences in the relative wages, which can be exogenous, such as institutions and
infra-structure, or endogenous factors, such as technological skills and labor force qualification.

                                                              7
Although there is no precise measure for skills and qualification, the structure of occupations is usually a
fair proxy for the level of socioeconomic development, which in turn affects social and human capital.
And there are remarkable differences in the composition of the occupation groups among the economic
sectors (see Appendix A). For example, the sector Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry, Fishing, where relative
wages tend to be lower than labor productivity, is almost exclusively composed by farming workers
(especially in Brazil) characterized by low levels of skills and education. In turn, the sector Other
Activities, which presents high relative wages, concentrates the most representative share of Professionals
in both countries (23% in Brazil and 36% in the U.S.).
Since the linear trend in 2013 is above the trend in 1983, average wages are relatively higher than labor
productivity. This is particularly true in Brazil, were average wages grew much faster than labor
productivity. Nonetheless, in opposition to a steadier dynamics of labor productivity, average labor
earnings in Brazil witnessed periods of high volatility between 1983 and 2013 (Figure 1). In the 1980s,
labor earnings reached peaks during the Cruzado Plan I in 1986 and the Cruzado Plan II in 1989.
However, due to the ineffectiveness of these economic adjustments, based on price freeze to control
hyperinflation, labor earnings fell sharply in the short run to adjust for the dynamics of labor productivity.

Labor earnings were especially affected by the return of hyperinflation in the 1990s. In 1992 average
labor earnings reached the lowest level in the whole period of analysis, pushing down relative wages.
After several plans fail to control hyperinflation, the Real Plan in 1994 brought stability to the economy
and gave opportunity to a substantial valuation of labor earnings. However, four years later Brazil
underwent a new cycle of economic crisis and wage squeezing with the outbreak of the Asian financial
crisis in 1997. Foreign capital flew away and the Brazilian government was forced to apply a new fiscal
adjustment and a sharp devaluation of the national currency, which contributed to reduce both average
earnings and GVA per worker. The economic crisis reached a peak in 2003, when the uncertainty
generated by the change of government frightened away foreign investment. In 2004, average earnings,
labor productivity and relative wages reached the same levels of 1983.
In the 2010s, Brazil was especially benefited by the world economic prosperity and the substantial
valuation of the commodity prices. Between 2004 and 2013, labor productivity grew 26 percentage
points. Influenced by the economic prosperity and important institutional changes, such as successive
valuations of the minimum wage and increasing share of formal job positions in the labor market, average
earnings grew 43 percent between 2004 and 2013. Because labor productivity grew more slowly (just 14
percent), relative wages reached the highest level since 1986.


                                                       8
In opposition to the unstable dynamics of labor indicators in Brazil, labor productivity grew almost
steadily in the U.S., bringing together labor earnings. The main structural change happened in 2009 when,
as a consequence of the financial crisis in 2007-08, unemployment grew strongly and labor earnings
plummeted. Nonetheless, labor productivity continued growing and relative wages reached their lowest
levels in three decades. After three decades, the overall result in the American labor market was still
strongly positive: between 1983 and 2013 average labor earnings grew 26 percent and GVA per worker,
39 percent.
The rise of Brazilian relative wages in the 2000s was strongly influenced by the dynamics of the low-paid
occupational groups: sales and laborers, and low services (Figure 2) These two groups represent more
than half of the occupational structure in Brazil and had, together with professionals, the most striking
increases in the relative wages during the whole period of analysis. The group low services, which
represents low paid occupations in the service sector of the economy, accounted for 19 percent of the
Brazilian employed population and presented the lowest relative wage of the occupational structure (see
Table 1 for information about percentage distribution, average earnings and labor productivity, and
Appendix B for information about relative wages according to two-digit occupational groups). The
average labor earnings of this group grew 57 percent between 1983 and 2013 (the highest value in the
occupational structure), although GVA per worker in their respective sectors did not grow in the period
(Table 1). As a result, relative wages jumped from 0.124 in 1983 to 0.197 in 2013 (Appendix B).

The sales and laborers group, which represents mainly sales workers and manual jobs in the construction,
extraction, transportation and manufacturing sectors, is the most representative in the Brazilian
occupational structure (38 percent in 2013) and presents the second lowest relative wage, even lower than
that of the group of farming workers. The dynamics of relative wages in this groups was also determined
mainly by the rising average earnings, since the average labor productivity in their respective economic
sectors did not rise in the period. The sub-group of construction and extraction workers presented the
most striking increase in the relative wage (93 percent, shifting from 0.197 in 1983 to 0.380 in 2013),
which would be mainly related to the growing demand of workers as a consequence of the housing boom
witnessed in this country in the 2000s.
The group of farming workers is notably known in Brazil by its low levels of earnings and productivity.
Nonetheless, the agricultural sector underwent a late technological revolution in recent decades, with the
new frontier of agricultural development in the Brazilian Midwest. As a result, average labor earnings
increased by 61 percent between 1983 and 2013 (the highest score in the occupational structure) and
GVA per worker soared more than twice. Since productivity grew faster than average earnings, relative

wage reduced by 47 percent (from 0.581 to 0.308). Nonetheless, their lower levels of average earnings
and labor productivity in comparison with other occupational groups largely reflect regional
heterogeneities in the systems of agricultural production (Maia & Sakamoto, 2014).

The group of professionals is represented by highly qualified workers, usually with a higher education
diploma, with high average earnings (just lower than that of the group of managers). Their relative wage
is the second highest in the occupational structure and had a substantial growth between 1983 and 2013
(30 percent). The relative wage is extremely high for some occupations in this group. For example, in
2013 the relative wage was higher than 1 for legal, biological and health, mathematics and related, and
social and human sciences occupations. This means that the average labor earnings of these groups was
higher than the average GVA per worker in their respective economic sectors.
Finally, managers and specialists had few changes in their relative wages during the last three decades.
The average earnings of managers, who control the capital or the labor force in public and private
institutions, increased by just 5 percent between 1983 and 2013, while the GVA per worker in their
respective sectors increased by 13 percent. As a result, relative wage reduced by 7 percent in the period.
Specialists, represented mainly by administrative support occupations and other jobs in offices with
intermediary qualification, had the second lowest variation in the average earnings in the period (just 16
percent), while the GVA per worker in their respective economic sectors increased by 4 percent. As a
result, relative wage increased just 12 percent.
The dynamics of labor indicators in the U.S. helps to understand some similarities and to highlight some
peculiarities of the Brazilian case. Because the dynamics of labor earnings was more attached to the GVA
per worker in the U.S., their relative wages presented lower variability. The variation ranged from -20 to
+20 percent for most occupational groups. Exception for the groups of sales and laborers and faming,
where relative wages reduced by 38 percent in the last three decades. Similarly to Brazil, average
earnings in the American agricultural sector grew more slowly than labor productivity between 1983 and

2013: 57 percent against 154 percent. Similar phenomenon was witnessed among sales and laborers,
where average labor earnings increased by just 8 percent and labor productivity soared 74 percent.


   4.2.The determinants of relative wages
Two regression models, one for Brazil and other for the U.S., were estimated by Ordinary Least Squares
using the log of relative wage as dependent variable (equation 3). Industry-level heterogeneities were
controlled by fixed effects. Results allow us to examine the extent to which differentials of relative wages
between occupational groups is due to their socioeconomic characteristics, for example, higher age or
education, or due to an unobservable occupational premium, which means differentials that are not
merely explained by social or productive characteristics. Surely, the accuracy of this analysis depends on
the quantity and quality of explanatory factors that are used to control wage and productive differentials.
In this study, they were mainly limited by the information that was simultaneously available for Brazil
and the U.S..
Both models, for Brazil and the U.S., fitted well to the sample of observations. The coefficient of
determination was equal to 0.89 in Brazil and 0.63 in the U.S.. The F statistics were significant at 0.01%
in both countries. Table 3 presents the ordinary least square estimates for the coefficients (equation 3),
which were also mostly significant at 5%.
A positive coefficient may be due to 4 reasons: i) positive variation of both average earnings and labor
productivity, but in higher degree for average earnings; ii) positive variation for average earnings and no
change for labor productivity; iii) no change for average earnings and negative variation for labor
productivity; iv) negative variation for both average earnings and labor productivity, but in higher degree
for labor productivity. Reason (i) is more likely to occur in the U.S., since productivity increased in most
economic sectors. Reason (ii) is more likely to occur in Brazil, since productivity remained with few
changes for most activities, with the exception of the substantial improvement in the agricultural sector.
For analytical simplicity, we will say that average earnings increase faster than labor productivity. On the
contrary, a negative coefficient would be mainly due to (i) positive variation for both average earnings
and labor productivity, but in higher degree for labor productivity. In other words, labor productivity
increases faster than labor productivity.
Results highlight that differences between most groups is higher in Brazil. For example, when compared
to basic education (less than superior), a one percentage point increase in the share of secondary
education (less than superior) in Brazil would increase average relative wage in 1.103%. In the U.S. the
partial effect is just 0.173%. Opportunely, the groups of education present the most striking differences of
relative wages in both countries, probably because average labor earnings tend to grow much faster than
GVA per workers as the share of highly educated workers in the labor force increases.
Differences between age groups are also substantial in both countries. The higher the share of adult (30 to
49 years) and older workers (50 or more), the higher the average relative wages. In turn, this result
suggests that the group of young workers (up to 29 years old) contributes more to reduce average wages
than to affect labor productivity. Differences between groups of race are significant only in Brazil, where
the increasing participation of white workers contributes to raise relative wages and the increasing
participation of black workers contributes to reduce relative wages. In turn, differences of gender are
substantial and similar in both countries: the higher the share of women workers, the lower the relative
wages.
The coefficients for the occupational groups have the group sales and laborers as reference of analysis.
Thus, the higher the coefficient, the higher its relative average wage in comparison to that of sales and
laborers. Estimates reproduce partly the hierarchy of relative wages observed in the previous analysis.
Now the effects of socioeconomic characteristics are controlled for and the differentials among
occupational groups (partial effects) tend to be lower than that observed for the unconditional averages
(Appendix B).

The group managers presents the highest positive differential of relative wage, in both countries. In other
words, their positive differential of average earnings would be much higher than their contribution to

                                                                 12
increase labor productivity, even after socioeconomic characteristics are controlled for. In turn, the partial
effect of professionals is just significant in the U.S., where the differentials of average earnings seem to
be much higher than their impact on labor productivity. In Brazil, they present similar relative wages than
sales and laborers, after socioeconomic characteristics are controlled for.
The groups of specialists, sales and laborers, low services and farming present the lower relative wages
after socioeconomic characteristics are controlled for. In Brazil, specialists are more likely to be
underpaid than other occupational groups: their relative wage is 16 percent lower than that of sales and
laborers ( e 0.180  1) when other factors are controlled for. This is a peculiar result because, specialists
present an average relative wage 13 percent higher than sales and laborers (see Appendix B) when
socioeconomic characteristics are not controlled for. Although specialists tend to have higher level of
education than sales and laborers, it seems that they are not paid accordingly.
Finally, the coefficients associated with the variable year (ranging from 30 for 1983 to 0 for 2013) and
its interactions with the occupational groups identify structural changes in the relation between the
occupational structure and relative wages across the years. The group sales and laborers is used as
reference again. Thus, the variable year identify the annual trend of relative wage for the group sales and
laborers, holding constant socioeconomic characteristics. The interactions between year and the
occupational groups identify how this growth rate differs from the previous one for each specific
occupational group.
In both countries, there is an overall trend toward the reduction of relative wages. In other words, similar
socio-occupational groups would be in a more unfavorable condition of labor earnings in relation to the
average labor productivity in their respective economic sectors. In Brazil, this trend is more apparent
among blue collars, specialists and managers. In the U.S., among blue collars and low services.


4. Concluding remarks
Since the definition of average earnings and the GVA per worker were based on different approaches,
relative wages in Brazil and in the U.S. cannot be directly comparable. For example, formal workers in
Brazil have the right to receive an annual 13th wage and a vacation bonus6, which is not easily captured by
monthly self-reported measures in its household surveys. While in Brazil the Consolidation of Labor
Laws (CLT, or Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho) bring together most of the employees’ rights, in the
U.S. the states have more autonomy to define the extent to which the benefits provided to workers and
labor laws are more flexible, which is mainly used by employers to attract the most qualified workers.
Nonetheless, the comparison of the trends in the long run provides valuable insights to analyze how the
relation between average earnings and labor productivity were affected by structural changes in these
countries. For example, the dynamics of labor earnings in the U.S. showed to be more attached to labor
productivity, where both indicators exhibited substantial growth in the last three decades. The main
change occurred with the outbreak of financial crisis in 2007-08, when, as a consequence of rising
unemployment, average earnings plummeted while GVA per worker continued growing. Meanwhile,
Brazil witnessed several economic cycles during which average earnings grew initially much faster than
labor productivity, suddenly falling down in the subsequent years. The historical trend of relative wages
in this country also raises serious doubts about the sustainability of its growth in the early 2000s. When
compared to 1983, average earnings grew more than 40 percent in 2013, while labor productivity grew
less than 20 percent. As a result, relative wages reached the highest value since 1986, attaining levels that
did not show to be historically sustainable in the long run.
The differentials of relative wages among socioeconomic groups reinforce prior studies, highlighting how
wage differentials match productivity differentials for some groups, but not for others (Sakamoto & Kim,

    The formal worker receive an additional one third of his/her monthly wage when in vacation.

                                                               13
2014). For example, increases in the participation of highly educated (with secondary school diploma or
more), prime-aged and older (aged 30 and over) and male workers tend to increase labor earnings more
significantly than labor productivity. In turn, gender differentials are significant just in Brazil, where race
also seems to determine more remarkably wages than productivity.
The differences of relative wages among occupational groups also reinforce the theoretical hierarchy of
classes among these social groups (Maia & Sakamoto, 2015). The group of managers, which aggregates
both employers and hired managers, presents the highest occupational premium, in both countries. But
this result must be analyzed carefully, since differences between earnings and the firm surplus are not
easily captured for small employers in household surveys. Nonetheless, Weeden & Grusky (2014)
identify three main sources that could justify how managerial occupations experience a relative advantage
in wages (managerial rent): i) pay-setting institutions, that provide managers with high performance-
based bonuses to prevent them from making business decisions that prioritize their own interest over
those of the firm; ii) pay-setting institutions that divorce managerial pay from firm performance and, thus,
allow the interests of board members to prevail over the firm, for example, defining their own payment;
and iii) the raising demand for new forms of management as a result of changes in the process of
production and in the structure of the firms.
When compared to the group sales and laborers, the occupational premium of professionals is significant
just in the U.S.. This later group is composed by highly educated and highly paid occupations. In Brazil,
professionals’ average wage is almost twice higher than that of sales and laborers, with few differences
in the average labor productivity (just 7%). Nonetheless, a larger share of this wage differential seems to
be explained by the net effect of the superior diploma: 77 percent of the professionals had a superior
diploma in 2013, against 4 percent of sales and laborers.
Specialists come before than sales and laborers in the hierarchy of the occupational structure, but their
net impact on relative wages (occupational premium) is significantly lower than the latter group, which is
historically characterized by lower levels of wage and education. In other words, specialists are not being
paid accordingly to their levels of educational attainment and skills, which would be due to the growing
supply of specialists with secondary diploma in Brazil. In fact, this group witnessed the second highest
reduction in the occupational premium between 1983 and 2013, while the share of specialists with
secondary diploma almost doubled, shifting from 36 percent to 61 percent.
Finally, the groups with the lowest occupational premium are: sales and laborers, low services and
farming. Occupations characterized by routinized activities demand low levels of skills and education. In
Brazil, the historical oversupply of unskilled and badly educated workers, many of them migrants from
rural areas, help to explain their low levels of wage in relation to average productivity. In the U.S., the
sharp progress in information and communication technologies would have stimulated employers to
substitute labor for information technology in performing workplace tasks, especially in activities that
could be easily routinized by computers (Acemoglu & Autor, 2010). Routine tasks are characteristic of
many middle skilled cognitive and manual jobs in these bottom occupational groups, such as cashiers,
assemblers, operators and production-related workers.
In Brazil, the rise of average earnings, especially among occupational groups on the bottom of the
occupational structure in the last decade, seemed to be more influenced by institutional factors, such as
the valuation of the minimum wage and the increasing share of formal workers under the labor
legislation, than by economic factors, such as rising productivity. The only exception is the group of
farming workers, since relative wages in this group plummeted in last decades due to the substantial
improvement of labor productivity in the agricultural sector, phenomenon that was also witnessed in the
U.S..
Although some studies have highlighted the unusual growth of wages among top professionals in the
American labor market in recent decades (for example, Autor, 2014), results presented in this study
suggest that this trend is consistent with the dynamics of labor productivity in their respective economic
sectors. In other words, labor productivity might be the main responsible for substantial income growth
among professionals in the U.S., rather than an increasing shortage in the supply of skilled professionals.
                                                      14
Surely, a more accurate analysis of these trends should be done using a firm level data on labor
productivity. However, firm level data are not easily accessible for all economic sectors. There are also
intrinsic difficulties to compare GVA between extremely diverse sectors. For example, while the GVA in
the manufacturing sector is estimated on the basis of the total production of goods, the GVA of public
services available for free is estimated on the basis of the production costs assumed by the government.
Thus, differences in the provision of public services can also affect labor productivity. Nonetheless, the
methods recently used to compute national accounts have improved substantially to attenuate such
difficulties and provide a fair basis to analyze productivity in the short and long term (Pikety, 2014).
