ABSTRACT: This paper aims at evaluating how much does talent – the individual non-observed
characteristics – matter to explain the wage differences between workers from the cultural industry
and workers from other formal industries in Brazil. With the importance of the cultural industry in
Brazil in mind and noting that there are gaps in the earnings of artists and cultural workers from
other workers, we use the data from 2003 to 2008 of the Rais-Migra – MTE, which is a true panel
of formal workers from Brazil. We use fixed effects estimators to capture the talent measure and the
Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973) decomposition to seek for evidences of wage difference. We
analyzed the workers in cultural activities, workers in cultural occupations and those workers in
both cultural activities and occupations. Doing so, we were able to compare differences depending
on the definition. The results enable us to affirm that the talent is important in the determination of
wages especially when considering formal workers in the cultural activities, occupations and sector.
The Oaxaca decomposition showed that when considering the talent, each of the groups mentioned
above paid their workers even more just because they belong to the group, proving that not only the
talent matter but also that the formal cultural environment in Brazil positively discriminates their
workers.

RESUMO: Esse artigo tem como objetivo principal analisar o papel do talento – definido como as
características individuais não-observadas – na explicação dos diferenciais salariais entre
trabalhadores provenientes do setor cultural e demais trabalhadores do setor formal brasileiro.
Diante da importância da indústria cultural no Brasil, e considerando a existência de diferenciais
nos rendimentos dos artistas e trabalhadores do setor cultural em relação aos demais trabalhadores
no Brasil, usaram-se dados da RAIS-Migra – MTE – entre 2003 a 2008. Tais dados constituem um
painel de trabalhadores formais do Brasil, permitindo o uso do método de efeitos fixos para estimar
a medida do talento, além da decomposição de Blinder (1973) e Oaxaca (1973) em busca de
evidências sobre os diferenciais salariais. Foram analisadas diferentes definições para os
trabalhadores da indústria cultural, conforme setor de atividade, ocupação e ambos. Os resultados
revelam a importância do talento na determinação dos salários. A decomposição de Oaxaca mostrou
que não apenas o talento é importante, mas também que o ambiente cultural discrimina
positivamente seus trabalhadores no Brasil.

1. INTRODUCTION


        Wage differential between industries is well determined in Economics literature. Krueger
and Summers (1987, 1988), Gittleman and Wolff (1993), Keane (1993), Dickens and Katz (1997),
Kahn (1998), Shippen (1999) are some of the traditional papers that investigate the nature of the
gap between wages. Along with these works, Blackburn and Neumark (1991), Jackubson (1991),
Abowd et al (1999) and Carruth et al (2004) are also noteworthy as they point towards the
importance of the non-observed characteristics to explain such differences and the use of the fixed
effects estimators.
        The case between artists and workers from other industries are known to exist and are
extensively researched as seen in Filer (1986), Thorsby (1994), Benhamou (2003), Wassal and
Alper (2006) and Wetzels (2008). Benhamou (2007) investigates the job market for the cultural
sector analyzing hiring, the career, wages and earnings. In general, artists and workers from the
cultural industries are underpaid compared to those from other industries. This can be related to fact
that cultural workers usually are at informal jobs, or that this is partial job most of the times
(WASSAL AND ALPER, 1992; THROSBY, 1992, TOWSE, 1992). On the order hand, Towse
(2006) points out that talent is compared to the innate ability of people, i.e. it cannot be measured
by traditional models and, indeed, affect the wages from artists and cultural workers.
        The Brazilian cultural sector is growing steadily over the last years. According to the
Brazilian Bureau of Statistics (IBGE, 2005), 5% of people were employed in cultural industries and
these industries responded to 11% of countries’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The João Pinheiro
Foundation (FJP, 1998) asserts that workers in cultural activities are 30% better paid than others
workers. Table 1 summarizes some evidence of the importance of the cultural industries in Brazil.

        With the importance of the cultural industry in Brazil in mind and noting that there are gaps
in the earnings of artists and cultural workers from other workers, the objective of this paper is to

                                                                                                        2
evaluate how much does talent matter in the Brazilian case, i.e., we try to evaluate how much does
the talent – the non-observed characteristics – contributes to the earnings of cultural workers while
analyzing wage gaps between workers from the formal sector in Brazil. To achieve such goal we
use the data from 1990 to 2002 of the Rais-Migra3, which is a true panel of formal workers from
Brazil. We use fixed effects estimators to capture the talent measure and the Blinder (1973) and
Oaxaca (1973) decomposition to seek for evidences of wage difference.
            It is important to highlight that there are few works in the literature that analyses the wage
gaps in the Brazilian cultural industries. Also we have no knowledge of a paper that used a true
panel to analyze the difference in wages between cultural workers and others for the Brazilian case.
So this paper contributes in the empirical literature expanding the insights in the Brazilian industry
earning gaps and in the use of a dataset that may shed more light in the importance of talent per se.


2. THEORETICAL MODEL


           The Walrasian competitive model of labor market states that the equilibrium wage is
determined by marginal productivity. For example, two agents with identical productive
characteristics would necessarily receive identical wages. However, similar individuals under
different working conditions may receive the so-called compensating differences. Indeed, the
disutility undergone by one individual following the performance of a task in an unfavorable
situation may lead to wage compensation.
           Though, pioneer observations by Slichter (1950), and more recently Dickens and Katz
(1987), Krueger and Summers (1988) and Katz and Summers (1989) have challenged this simple
description of wage determination. These authors were able to demonstrate that workers with the
same observable individual characteristics and working conditions but employed in different sectors
were paid differently in the U.S.
           Comparable results have been obtained for a large number of countries in the past years
(Araï et al., 1996; Hartog et al., 1997, 2000; Lucifora, 1993; Vainiomäki and Laaksonen, 1995).
Furthermore, it has been shown that not only the structure of inter-industry wage is quite persistent,
but also, it is strongly correlated between countries, however, its scale varies considerably between
industrialized countries (Helwege, 1992; Zanchi, 1992). In addition, many studies (Barth and
Zweimüller, 1992; Edin and Zetterberg, 1992; Gannon et al., 2007; Kahn, 1998; Teulings and
Hartog, 1998) suggest that in countries with strong corporatism, regardless of the period studied, the
sectoral effects are significantly weaker.

    Administrative data from the Labor Ministry. The dataset will be better explained in the Methodological section.
                                                                                                                       3
           In this sense, the existence of a wage premium from different sector increasingly raises some
questions over the assumption of a perfectly competitive labor market. Indeed, it suggests that
individual wages are not solely determined by personal productive characteristics and task
descriptions, but also by employer features in each sector. Nevertheless, great uncertainty remains.
           Thus, following Wassal and Alper (2006) and Towse (2006), the Becker’s human capital
theory is widely used even in the case of cultural workers and artists. Hence, Mincer’s (1974)
earning function is proper to be used. So, expanding the equation presented by Micer (1974) we
have that




where        is the wage,     is the schooling or formal training,     is the experience of the worker which
is measured by the time of employment,               are worker’s characteristics and   are characteristics of
the job such as region, size of the firm, among others.
           Towse (2006) states that the innate ability is the same as the talent for artists, and that it
plays a bigger role in arts than non-arts occupations. Moreover, she discusses whether the human
capital theory is the best to explain artist’s labor market, concluding that although some experience
it is a good point of start. She also affirms that artists should be compared to sportspeople, as many
of their labor markets characteristics are quite similar.


3. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH


           This section is divided in two. Firstly, we will present the data used (RAIS-Migra) and a
short descriptive analysis. Secondly, we will describe the econometric approach used in this paper.


3.1 Data
           For our analysis on wage differential we use the longitudinal micro-data from the Relatório
Anual de Informações Sociais – Migração (RAIS-Migra), of the Labor Ministry of Brazil, for the
eight years between 2003 and 2008. This dataset is derived from RAIS, an annual administrative
survey that makes available information to identify workers eligible to receive social benefits and to
monitor the labor market. It also provides extensive employment coverage, besides a rich source of
economic information at the individual level.4 In this regard, it can be considered as a labor census
of formal employment. Informal employment and illegal activities are not recorded by the RAIS
census.

    See Arbache (2001) for further explanation about RAIS data base.
                                                                                                            4
        RAIS-Migra follows longitudinally the professional course of workers by industry and
occupational features in the labor market, providing the conduction of studies on mobility of formal
workers. The investigation of the wage structure, which considers wages deflated by the IPCA
(Índice de Preços ao Consumidor – Amplo) and corrected by cost of living index5, is carried out for
the 26 Brazilian states plus the Federal District, the eight sectors of the economy classified by the
Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), and the six occupation categories based on
the Brazilian Occupation Classification (CBO)6. The other independent variables are age, tenure
(monthly), gender and nine educational levels, following the Labor Ministry classification. The
micro-data sample is composed of workers between the ages of 14 and 65, with non-zero monthly
income. Data definitions are presented in the Appendix 1.
        Due to the large number of observations available, a random sample was generated in order
to run the wage differentials regressions. This sample draws 5% of the total number of individuals
from the original data base, generating a pooled and balanced sample of 8,684,232 individuals,
being 1,447,372 by year.
        Table 2 presents some descriptive analysis from the dataset. From the data we can observe
in the mean, the workers observed have worked 1,045.16 hours and have 39.16 years, and 43% of
the data are women. Looking at their education, at least 24% have engaged in superior education,
and from the rest, 38% have attended at least part of High School. Focusing on the cultural sector
and occupation we have that 2.9% of the individuals are in the cultural activities defined by IBGE
based on CNAE (Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas) – the Brazilian classification
of economic activities – as it is possible to see in Appendix 2. Furthermore, 2.4% of the individuals
have some cultural occupation based on CBO (Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações) – the
Brazilian classification of occupations. By interacting both, we find that only 0.5% of the
individuals are in the so-called cultural sector working in both, cultural or artistic activity and
assuming a cultural or artistic occupation. It is important to reinforce that this data contemplates
only formal individuals, and most of artistic-cultural workers are in informal jobs. Nevertheless, it
is crucial to be highlighted that the use of this dataset enables us to use an econometric approach
that control the unobserved characteristics of the individuals which it is possible to assume to be
mainly their innate ability or the talent itself.

3.2 Econometric approach


         Deriving the earning function presented in the section 2, we have that the model to be
estimated is:
                                                                                                   (i)
where        is the wage,       is the job sector represented by the a cultural sector dummy, or a cultural-
artistic occupation dummy or the interaction between both previous dummies,                               is the matrix of
variables containing a dummy variable for gender (feminine), dummies for regions (Brazilian
states), dummies for level of education, age, age squared, experience, experience squared,
represents the individuals unobserved characteristics and                 is the term of error.
         Firstly, we use a pooled OLS including all years jointly as a large cross-section. To avoid
further problems a vector of year dummies are also included as control variables. However, the
main problem in this case is the possibility of correlation between                   and the explanatory variables
nullifying the following hypothesis:


                                                                                                   (ii)
         If the hypothesis above cannot be hold, the causality relationship cannot be maintained
either. Hence, an endogeneity7 problem may appear, generating inconsistent and biased estimators.

  In general, we do not have information about the worker potential to obtain wages. As a consequence, these
unobservable characteristics – ability, motivation, creativity, etc. – might be correlated to other wage determinants, such
                                                                                                                         6
Once, the dataset we are using is a longitudinal panel data of workers, this endogeneity problem can
be solved by considering the unobserved heterogeneity, i.e., using the random effects or the fixed
effects methods. As the unobserved characteristics of each worker will not change over the years,
we have then, a fixed effect model8.
         The identification hypothesis of the model represented in equation (i) requires that the
correlation among         ,     and      is provided by an explanatory variable that does not vary among
years. Since we have differences of the individual values of the variables with regard to the average
values, the constant term is eliminated. As a result, we have the fixed effects estimator, with
consistent and efficient estimated parameters. It is important to stress, however, that the hypothesis
from equation (i) may not eliminate the endogeneity problem. A random shock can increase wages
independently of the worker sector, for example.
         In order to capture the premium that the cultural sector may pay in the Brazilian case,
following the evidences from Ferreira Neto, Freguglia and Fajardo (2012) we use the Oaxaca
decomposition. Greene (2003) describes it as follows9:
         Let it be a sample of workers, in which we have                  workers in the cultural sector and
workers in non-cultural sectors. A mincerian regression for earnings for each worker could be
presented as
                                                                                              (iii)

  Although such assumption was made, formal Hausman's tests were done confirming our initial assumption.

  Greene (2003) presents the methodology comparing the differences between men and women, however in this paper
we present it following the same model, but considering cultural and non-cultural sector.
                                                                                                                       7
       The second term of the decomposition shows the differences explained by the human
capital, which would be the sole difference if the Walrasian competitive model was true, and the
wages were determined only by the marginal productivity. The first term instead, shows the
differences in the wages attributed to the differences that the human capital cannot explain
(GREENE, 2003).
       Vaz e Hoffmann (2007) analyze the wage differential between the public and private sector
in the Brazilian economy. The authors state that in this case the interpretation is little different from
the one commonly used in the discrimination literature. In this sense, one part would explain the
earnings according to the productive characteristics from the individuals of each group (E) and the
other would explain the different criteria of remuneration of each sector (D). Thus:




4. RESULTS


       The results are presented following the methodology section. Firstly, at table 3 we present
the results for models (1) to (3), being (1) for cultural activities (dcnae), (2) for cultural occupation
(dcbo) and (3) for cultural ‘sector’ (dcult) – the interaction between dcnae and dcbo – considering
an OLS model. Secondly, at table 4 we present the results for the models (4) to (6), being (4) for
dcnae, (5) for dcbo and (6) for dcult considering a fixed effects (FE) model. Finally, at table 5 we
present the Oaxaca decomposition for each dummy of interest (dcnae, dcbo and dcult) considering
both the OLS and FE models in order to compare them.
       For models (1) to (3) (table 3) we have similar results for the control and human capital
variables as follows: a) women are paid 34% less than men; b) experience is positive but near to
zero, showing little influence in the remuneration, however, the experience squared also shows a
positive coefficient showing that even though there is little influence, it grows continually; c)
regarding the age, each additional year represents an increase of 5%, and the age squared shows that
there is a maximum for this increase; d) focusing on the education, we have that workers with
fundamental education completed earns 37.5% more than analphabets, workers that completed the
high school earns 74.4% more than analphabets and those with superior education earns 164% more
than analphabets.
       Regarding the dummies of interest we have that, on one hand workers in cultural activities
(dcnae) earn 10.2% more than workers in non-cultural activities. On the other hand, workers in

cultural occupations (dcbo) earn 11.1% more than workers in non-cultural occupations. It is
noteworthy that the interaction between dcnae and dcbo (dult), i.e., workers in cultural activities
occupying cultural jobs, earn even more, 18.7% than others. These results show that occupation
seems to be more important than activity to determine the wage, and goes in the same direction as
the results presented by Ferreira Neto, Freguglia and Fajardo (2012) for formal and informal
workers in Brazil.

 When analyzing the results for the fixed effects it will be said that the difference is due to the innate ability or talent.
However, it is known that not only the talent is captured explaining the difference, but also it captures the information

        Turning our attention to the dummies of interest we have that, on one hand workers in
cultural activities (dcnae) earn 0.3% less than workers in non-cultural activities. On the other hand,


of omitted variables, among other factors. Nonetheless, to facilitate the discussion the talent will be said to be the
reason.
                                                                                                                   10
workers in cultural occupations (dcbo) earn 1.6% more than workers in non-cultural occupations.
Workers in cultural activities occupying cultural jobs (dcult) earn 2.2% than others. This reinforces
the importance of occupation over activity in the determination of earnings regarding cultural and
artistic workers.
       Comparing then, the results from table 3 and 4, we can highlight some interesting changes in
results. Firstly, the gender results and the schooling results shows a significant drop in the
coefficients, evidencing that although there is some difference – women are worst paid, and formal
education and training increase the earning – it is not that much when considering the innate ability.
Secondly, the age seems to be even more important when considering the talent (increase from 5%
to 11% in the determination of earnings), which is an interesting result that allows us to do some
assumptions: perhaps, the older the worker is, the more recognized he is, hence the more valued his
work is. Thirdly, the results for activity, occupation and for the so-called cultural sector, also drops
significantly, mainly for the activity which becomes negative.
       However, these results cannot express fully the ‘discrimination’ from the cultural activities,
occupation and sector, i.e., they are unable to show how much a group of workers earns more or
less only because they belong to a determined group, in this case, the cultural activity, cultural
occupation and cultural sector. So, table 5 presents the results for each dummy of group for both
models – OLS and FE. We have then that, (U) is the unexplained portion of the differential
(difference between model constants); (D) is the portion due to discrimination. If the number is
positive, the advantage is to the high group (dummy of interest equal to one) and if it is negative,
the low group (dummy of interest equal to zero) has the advantage.

       Firstly, we should look at the raw differential (R). We have that the difference is positive, so
it is higher for workers in cultural activities, occupation and sector. However, differently from the
                                                                                                       11
above results we have that the difference is higher for cultural activities (30.5%) compared to
cultural occupations (19.6%). This result is even higher for workers in the cultural sector (cultural
activity and occupation), with a raw difference of 39.3%
       The measure that interests us though is (D), or the discrimination portion. Analyzing (D) for
cultural activities we have that for the OLS model it is 9.8% and for the FE model it raises for
39.5%. This means that controlling the model for the talent, which means that in the FE model we
consider it, cultural activities pays 39.5% more than other activities for formal workers. Focusing
on the cultural occupations we have that for the OLS model the discrimination portion is 7.3%
while in the FE model it raises for 18.5%. The same inference as for dcnae is possible, when
considering the talent, we see that cultural occupations pays more than other occupation, and this
difference is 18.5% more. Finally, comparing the OLS and FE model for the so-called cultural
sector (dcult) we note a raise from 23.8% to 46.1%. This means that formal workers engaged in
cultural activities in cultural occupation earns 46.1% more than other workers just per se.
       At last, analyzing the percentage of (D) in terms of (R) and (E) in terms of (R) we have that
for cultural activities and occupation, in the OLS model the endowments represented more in terms
of R than the discrimination, however when using the FE model this relation is reverted. For the
cultural sector we have in both OLS and FE models that the (D) portion is more important than (E)
in terms of (R). It is noteworthy that in the FE model for dcnae and dcult the D portion is higher
than 100%.


5. FINAL REMARKS


       This paper aims at evaluating how much the talent contributes to the earnings of cultural
workers while analyzing wage gaps between workers from the formal sector in Brazil. To achieve
such goal, we analyzed the workers in cultural activities, workers in cultural occupations and those
workers in both cultural activities and education. Doing so, we were able to compare differences
depending on the definition. Thus, the results help us to better understand the labor market in the
cultural industry in Brazil.
       To measure the talent effect we proposed two models, the first using ordinary least square
estimation in which the talent was not considered and then a fixed effects model considering the
talent. The results enable us to affirm that the talent is an important in the determination of wages
especially when considering formal workers in the cultural activities, occupations and sector. The
Oaxaca decomposition showed that when considering the talent, each of the groups mentioned
above paid their workers even more just because they belong to the group, proving that not only the

workers.
