                                         Abstract
    The aim of this article is identify the eects of tracking by ability levels using the
peer eect linearity in students' social networks controlling by their math degree. First
of all we divide the dataset in three parts (low, middle and high ability) according to the
average scores of each network and estimate a spacial auto regressive model by maximum
likelihood. In this rst approach no signicant results were found, which suggests that
whether we group classrooms by math grades the peer eect does not have any linear im-
portance in students' scores. Second, we used quantile regressions and the results suggest
any signicant dierences among 10th, 25th, 50th and 75th peer eect quantiles coe-
cients, although all of them are positive and signicant. In the 90th quantile, no signicant
results were found. Once more, the results suggests that the peer eect assumes a linear
behavior and grouping students by academic achievement will not bring benecial results.

    O objetivo desse artigo é identicar os efeitos de agrupar estudantes por desempenho
utilizando a linearidade do efeito dos pares nas redes sociais dos estudantes controlando
pelas suas notas de matemática. Primeiro nós dividimos os dados em três partes (baixo,
médio e auto desempenho) de acordo com a nota média de cada rede e estimamos um mod-
elo de econometria espacial auto regressivo por máxima verossimilhança. Nessa primeira
estratégia não foram encontrados resultados signicantes, isso sugere que independente de
se agrupar as turmas pelas notas de matemática o efeito dos pares não tem nenhuma im-
portância linear sobre as notas dos alunos. Em uma segunda estimação usamos regressões
quantílicas e os resultando não mostram diferenças signicantes entre os quantis 10, 25, 50
e 75 dos coecientes do efeito dos pares, apesar de todos terem valor positivo e signicante.
No quantil 90 nenhum resultado signicante foi encontrado. Mais uma vez, os resultados
sugerem que o efeito dos pares assume um comportamento linear e agrupar alunos por
desempenho acadêmico não trará resultados proveitosos.

1 Introduction
    Studies in the area of economics of education like Langoni (1973), Barros and Rei (1990),
Barros e Mendonça (1997), Hanushek and Wöbmann (2010), reinforce the importance of a good
academic achievement to achieve good results in countries economy. The theoretical growth
literature emphasizes at least three mechanisms through which education may aect economics
growth. First, education can increase the human capital inherent in the labour force, which
increases labour productivity. Second, education can increase the innovative capacity of the
economy, and the new knowledge on new technologies, products and processes promotes growth.
Third, education helps the diusion and transmission of knowledge needed to understand and
process new information and to successfully implement new technologies devised by others,
which again promotes economics growth.

   Langoni (1973), Barros e Rei (1990) and Barros e Mendonça (1997) focus in showing how
higher educational standards can raise personal income and increase the quality of Brazilian
labour. More specically in Barros e Rei (1990) they found that there is a big education in-
equality between Brazilians and there is also a big dierence in wages and this gap could be
reduced in about 50% if the dierential for educational level were ignored. This result suggests
that investing in education could work as a wealth distribution mechanism.

    In the economics of education literature, the concerns are about studying the education
production and how to increase it. Some of the determinants of student achievement like in-
dividual inputs, parental counselling and education can not or is hardly inuenced by public
policies, however the use or allocation of school resources, especially public schools, can. The
peer eect is a usual subject in this area and is concerned in evaluate the eects that peers,
direct or indirect, can have over students scores. The idea is that normally a student is part of
a social network of peers in his classroom and school and the way that those peers interact with
each other (helping and discussing) and with the teacher (asking questions) can bring positive
eects for each student. Following Hanushek (2006) linearity occurs when peer eect is equally
identied through the dierent levels of students but not only on average.

    Another topic that has being study is the eciency of tracking policies in students scores.
Tracking is a form of allocate students based on previous scores, grouping students with high
grades in separated classes from average and lower grades students. These policies can cause a
lot of conicts and pedagogical issues. The central argument in favor of tracking is that more
homogeneous classrooms permit a more specied curriculum and a more appropriate rhythm
in lessons which maximizes the learning. Teachers won't have problems losing attention of
faster learners or complicating the understand of slower learners. However, the arguments
against tracking is that lower classrooms will always be in disadvantage by slower learning
environments and it might create a gap between higher classrooms when technically they were
supposed to nish school at the same level. When peer eects and tracking are considered
the eciency of tracking gets more unclear and that is why it is important to investigate peer
eects linearity. When lower level students are allocated together they tend to interact less
with the teacher and with each other which does not contribute to the peer eect.

    The Educational Economics literature as Hoer (1992), Argys et al (1996), Betts and Schkol-
nik (2000), Zimmer (2003), Hanushek(2006) and Raposo (2015) has explored well the peer ef-
fects and tracking but the linearity still have some space for innovation and proposals in it's
methodology and could bring new results and discussions. Therefore, in this study, the eects
of tracking are being investigated using students peer eects linearity. The link between track-


                                               2
ing and the non-linearity of peer eect comes from the arguments in favor of tracking. These
arguments focus in the relationship between teachers and the classroom, but by the peer eect
literature mentioned before and Educational Economics literature (Hanushek (1979), Rivkin,
Hanushek and Kain (2005), Menezes-Filho (2001) and Soares e Menezes(2010)) student achieve-
ment is explained by a complex set of factors and peers are included as an important inuence
over achievement, so, if peer eect does not persists in a grouped classroom tracking is cutting
of the peer eect from the student achievement.

   The paper is structured along the following lines. The next section look at the importance of
peer eect in Educational Economics. Section 3 introduces the model for the empirical analysis,
as well as the data availability and the units of analysis, while Section 4 present the empirical
results and discussion. The conclusions and some policy implication are included in Section 5.



2 Peer Eect and Tracking
    In the study of networks it is important to refer to Hoer (1992) which compares the overall
results of students in tracked and non-tracked classrooms and also students placed by their
ability in specic high, middle and low classrooms. He also discuss that peer eect conicts
with tracking because if students are being allocated in more homogeneous classrooms the peers
are going to be all from the same level and this could diminish the peer eect. However, is
by evaluating the linearity of peer eect that is possible to show if even in a homogeneous
classroom the eect is signicant or not. Hoer (1992) makes two covariance analysis, one
to compare the average eect between tracked and non-tracked schools. The second analysis
compares one high level student in a tracked school with a high level student in a non-tracked
school and so on. From the rst analysis it nds that the benets from tracking are negligible
and controlling for social background and initial student scores. In the second approach it
nds that students in a high level classrooms have a positive eect of .26 and .18 standard
deviation for seventh and eighth grades respectively. For students in the lower level classrooms
they found a eect of -.36 and -.32 standard deviation for seventh and eighth grades respectively.

    In the identication of social eects the work of Manski (1993) denes the Reection Prob-
lem which means that when a researcher observing the distribution of a population's behaviour
tries to infer if the average behaviour in a group or network inuences the behaviour of the
individuals part of this group. Manski (1993) denes three eects which are part of these social
structures that may cause problems in the identication of peer eects. The three eects are:


  1. Endogenous Eects - wherein the propensity of an individual to behave in some way varies
     with the behaviour of the group;

  2. Exogenous Eects - wherein the propensity of an individual to behave in some way varies
     with the exogenous characteristics of the group, and;

  3. Correlated Eects - wherein individuals in the same group tend to behave similarly be-
     cause they have similar individual characteristics or face similar institutional environ-
     ments.


   This problem is properly solved for the model used here (as mathematically demonstrated
in Bramoullé et al (2009)) because the data utilized allowed to construct one big network by

                                                3
classroom composed by other smaller and heterogeneous networks. This composition of the
networks will be properly explained later on.

    Argys et al (1996) does an interesting analysis of the tracking with high school students
in the USA and nds that removing the tracking would have a positive eect over lower level
students. They estimate each student score if they were not in a tracked classroom and com-
pares with their actual score and found an increase in scores from three up to seven points.
They applied a simple production function of education, however if the students were placed
in ability groups based on motivation and unobserved school quality and if these two variables
were correlated with achievement the results will be biased. To avoid it, they use a multinomial
logit model of track selection to estimate selectivity correction terms. For the model used in
the Methodology and Data section this problem will not exist because there is no tracking or
grouping and the classrooms are composed by age.

    Another article which compares schools with tracking and those without tracking is Betts
and Shkolnik (2000). Similarly to Hoer (1992) they compare ability groups in tracked and
non-tracked schools. In a rst regression using all the controls and a dummy variable for track-
ing they found no eect in grouping students by ability. A second regression, where they use an
interaction term between ability level of classrooms and the tracking dummy, for the three lower
level classrooms they found a negative eect of 4,2 points for schools who track their students.
For the highest level classrooms they found a positive eect of 3,2 for tracked students. This
article also analyses the miss allocation of resources depending on classroom level and found
tendency of allocate less experienced teachers and smaller classrooms for lower level students.

    One of the articles that most inuenced this study is Zimmer (2003), because he uses a very
similar structure to the one used here, also the data and the main question is very similar. In
Zimmer (2003) the peer eect linearity is analysed in schools that apply tracking and those
that do not. In the article he uses a simple ordinary least squares model to estimate the peer
eect and divides the data in four datasets based on the average scores of the class and the
quantiles. The rst 25% allocated as low level, from the 25% to the 75% quantile were classi-
ed as middle level and above the 75% quantile classied as high level classrooms. The fourth
dataset includes all classes. Zimmer (2003) founds that the lower and middle level classrooms
had a negative and signicant coecient of 0.3 and 0.7 standard deviation, respectively. For the
highest quantile no signicant eect was found showing that lower and middle levels students
are worse of when allocated in a tracked classroom and the highest level students do not suer
any eect. One problem in this approach is that peer eect is measured by the average score
of the classroom so the eect of one peer over other is treated as equal. When using the social
network concept the reference group will be heterogeneous and protects your estimation from
Manski's Reection Problem. The model used in the methodology section applies this concept.

    The second article that highly inuenced this estimation and the proposed model is the PhD
thesis of Raposo(2015). The thesis in a highly detailed approach of the peer eect and uses
the same database used here, however, it only estimates the peer eect on average. In Raposo
(2015) it manages to identify the social networks of each student by a relationship matrix which
the lines and columns represents the students and it's respective friends. The construction of
this matrix is possible because of FUNDAJ's (Fundação Joaquim Nabuco) data base which
asks each student to list his ve closest friends in the classroom. The measure of peer eect is
the sum of the scores of each student network and it is found a positive and signicant peer
eect on students scores of 0.014 standard deviation.



                                               4
    In Schneeweis and Winter-Ebmer (2007) they study the peer eect and it's linearity for
Austrian schools assessed by PISA 2000 and 2003. The Austrian school system has an inter-
esting characteristic it has dierent types of schools depending on the goal of the student and
it's parents. Each type of school has dierent curriculum's, allocation of resources and entry
criteria based on previous academic scores. For this scenario they apply a production function
including school xed eects, individual and family characteristics and peers characteristics.
As PISA has no information about peers and classrooms they assume that students from the
same grade and school are peers which is a weakness compared to the database use for this
article. Finally, they estimate the mean eect by an ordinary least squares estimation and
found no signicant eect when including xed eects. The linearity is estimated by quantile
regression and for the reading scores nds that a student with low socio-economic index moving
to a new peer group with a quality of one standard deviation higher increase in achievement by
5.2 points. An student from the 75th percentile would benet 3.3% from the same movement.
For the math scores no increase was found.

    Pinto (2010) utilizing data for Brazilian public schools does a semi parametric approach
to estimate a production function with peer eect. It assumes that student achievement is
function of students quality and peers quality and utilizes the allocation of students in class as
a instrumental vector. It is found evidences that peer eect is positive independently of student
quality and that middle quality students benet more from their peers quality than does lower
quality students.

    A very interesting article is Hanushek (2006) which studies the eects or early tracking
over education inequality and performance for the PISA database. He applies a dierences in
dierences model and nds that early tracking increases inequality in most of the countries
although the evidence on the level of performance is less certain. It is also discussed that the
argument in favor of or against tracking gets more complicated when considering peer eect,
because understand how the peer eect works through achievement becomes a key element in
considering tracking.


3 Methodology and Data
3.1    Empiric Model

    As already mentioned the methodology proposed here is very similar to Zimmer (2003) and
Raposo (2015). The relationship matrix will be used as in Raposo (2015) to map each student
friendship network and calculate the peer eect based on the sum of the friend's scores which
compose each student reference group (network). The network matrix functions in this way:
In a classroom with 20 students the questionnaires are applied for each student and from that
it's taken the information of the individuals linked as part of his 5 closest friends. With this
data the following matrix is constructed:

     This way the G matrix displays that when the student i mention the student j as friend
gi,j = 1 and gi,j = 0 when is not mentioned. By convention, when i=j, gi,j = 0. In the networks
is possible that gi,j = gj,i , meaning that both students mentioned each other as friends creating
an indirect link. It is possible also to nd gi,j 6= gj,i meaning that only one student mentioned
the other creating a direct link.

   Following Zimmer (2003) and Raposo (2015) the model is represented below:

                         yt,h = µyt−1,h + λGyt,h + θ(x) + φη η + φζ ζ + 



                                   And : θ(x) = Xβ 0 + GXγ 0

                                                                                              (1)
    The equation above includes the scores of the rst exam yt,h , the scores of his direct peers
Gyt,h , the student individual characteristics and it's peers X and GX , two measures of xed
eect ζ and η representing the individual and the classroom's unobserved heterogeneities. How-
ever, as mentioned in Raposo (2015), even with the common characteristics of all network, it
is possible to exist unobserved individuals dierences (ζi,k ) that aect the formation of links
(friendships) and the student achievement in fact, so, this kind of approach only stands valid
if the inclusion of ηk also controls for the unobserved individuals characteristics.

    It is important to notice the strength of using the rst exam variable as control. By using
this variable as control it is possible to capture a hole set of inuences that could contaminate
the coecients. The observable and unobservable background of family, school and student
community and also the student unobservable characteristics are controlled by this scores and
it can be considered a student's xed eect as argued by Ding and Lehrer (2007).

    The estimation method used for the proposed model follows Raposo (2015) and Zimmer
(2003) and two estimations are applied. The rst is the quantile regression that analyses the
peer eect by students ability level, so, in this approach, it is being considered the eect that
peers have over a low, middle or high level student. Whereas, as described in Raposo (2015),
this way of estimating the model is biased, because even if the network xed eects and the
individual xed eects can control for any type of unobserved variable, the OLS estimation
of the interested variable λ is biased, since the achievement simultaneously would generate a
spatial dependency with the error term.

   The second estimation uses a spatial auto regressive model estimated by maximum likeli-
hood as proposed by Calvó-Armengol et al. (2009), Lee (2007) and also applied by Raposo

                                                   6
(2015). This model allows to control the spatial dependency in the error term induced by the
simultaneity of the dependent variable y which the quantile regression does not.

    The contribution in relation to Raposo (2015) proposed model and the one applied here is
the division of the data by the average ability level of the networks (represented by the letter
h) which allow to evaluate if the peer eect remains linear for dierent levels of networks. The
division of the database follows Zimmer (2003) proposal to divide the data by the quantiles of
the average scores of the network. In this case until the 25% quantile is classied as low level,
between the 25% and 75% quantiles middle level and above the 75% quantile high level. As
the schools from this dataset do not track their classrooms this article also contributes with
a suggestion of analysing tracking policies even when it is not being applied in classrooms,
dierent from Zimmer (2003), Hoer (1992) and Argys et al (1996) which are able to use a
tracking dummy in their models. This new way of analysing tracking helps to make more
ecient decision when allocating students into classrooms especially for schools considering to
track their students.



3.2    Database

    An very important point of the realization of this research is the access to the database
utilized. The data were provided by the Fundação Joaquim Nabuco (FUNDAJ) collected in
the eld research named Acompanhamento Longitudinal do Desempenho Escolar de Alunos da
Rede Pública de Ensino Fundamental do Recife. The representative sample generated by the
research focus on 6 years old middle school students and assess students skills in math by the
application of two exams placed in the beginning of the year and in the end. Apart of the
exams, there was applied also questionnaires for students, math teacher, school principal and
the responsible for following the student academic life (tutor). The biggest innovation of this
database is the possibility to map the student friendship network and with this information is
possible to create an structure that allows to calculate more precisely the peer eect. Other
informations were collected regarding a series of social characteristics that allows to construct
a vast group of control variables allowing better model's specications.

    The database covers 4.191 students, 3670 parents or tutors, 120 school principals and 131
math teachers from 120 schools spatially distributed trough the eighteen micro regions of the
city of Recife. The data has an average of .45 male students, initial score average of 41.92,
nal score average of 41.15, percentage of self declared white students of .19, average age of
11.19 and .73 of new students to that school. The rest of descriptive and control variables are
displayed in the appendix section.

    These results show that the peer eect remains linear for most of the student ability level.
Until the 75th quantile the eect is signicant which may be a clue that the tracking would
not be ecient for those students because, as mentioned before, in this rst estimation the
composition of the classroom is heterogeneous so the model here looks for a student in a pool
of others dierent levels students. However, for the 90th quantile no signicance were found.
Even tough this estimation is biased, as explained before, the results are consistent comparing
to the literature (Especially the results found in Raposo(2015)) and also consistent with the
results from the maximum likelihood estimation.

  Table 2 bellow display the estimation resulting after controlling of peer eect and using
Maximum Likelihood:

    The coecients displayed above did not show any signicance at any acceptable level. It
is not possible to conrm the behavior of the peer eect by network level (homogeneous class-
room). If the signicance levels were more acceptable and the linearity by network levels were
conrmed the tracking would be a possibility to increase student achievement. On the other
way around if non-linearity were identied the tracking would depend in which level the peer
eect were signicant. Comparing both results, one complements the other because when sepa-
rated by network levels the peer eect was not signicant and quantile regressions are showing
that for this data the peer eect remains linear by student individual level, it might be an
evidence that tracking classrooms may not have a positive eect.

   It is important to confront the discussion of tracking versus peer eects and why these
results are supporting the non-tracking policy. As mentioned through the literature, the peer
eect emerges from the peer to peer learning and from the dierences in this peers levels which
are more likely to have dierent questions and doubts and bring up more diverse discussions.

                                                       8
So a tracked classroom will dicult gains from dierences in peers because it will be com-
posed by students with the same understanding level which are less likely to have dierent
questions and doubts to be discussed in class, it is also less likely to students discuss with each
other and the need of peer to peer helping is lower. So, technically, a tracked classroom works
as if it was composed only by a single student and a teacher completely eliminating peer eects.



5 Conclusion
    The proposal of this article to analyse tracking is properly achieved. Even though the quan-
tile estimations are biased the results found make sense comparing to the Maximum Likelihood
estimation and the literature. The persistence of the linearity of the eect found by Raposo
(2015) indicates that students from dierent levels are aected similarly by it's peers if the stu-
dent is from a certainty ability level in a heterogeneous classroom (the case which the quantiles
are analysed).

    From the results it is possible to say that tracking is not a ecient way to increase student
achievement and this results must be taken into account when discussing classroom composition
and allocation of students policies. Of course there is space for improvement and contribution
in this study area. One of the regards that must be done concerns the small numbers of observa-
tions when the networks are divided in ability levels that might be causing the non-signicance
of the coecients. For further studies would be interesting to examine the same strategy of
dividing the networks but by the quantiles analysed here. Making three new ability levels, the
results of the quantile regressions might indicates that it's possible to nd better results for the
maximum likelihood estimations.
