Abstract

Since the 1970s, the creation of Rural Settlements with state assistance has been one
of several strategies by the Federal Government of Brazil to colonize remote regions
with low population. Even though the area dedicated to these settlements remained
relatively stable for decades, between 2002 and 2014 Rural Settlements in the Amazon
region jumped from 220 thousand square kilometers to 376 thousand square kilometers,
an increase of 71%. This paper shows that most part of this increase was located in remote
areas with low population and in municipalities with high forest coverage. We also use a
xed-eect model to calculate the impact of the Rural Settlements created between 2002
and 2014 on deforestation. We nd that the impact is positive and statistically signicant.
Rural Settlements are responsible for 30% of total deforestation in the Amazon Biome.
We also nd that the eect is heterogeneous, and depends on the type of Rural Settlement,
with Rural Settlements types located in remote areas being responsible for most part of
the impact of Rural Settlements on deforestation.

1. Introduction


    Although in many countries "settlement"is a term used to designate a group of people
who establish themselves in an area to live and produce, Rural Settlement in Brazil
usually means some portion of land occupied by farmers who receive that land as part
of an agrarian reform eort. This land usually comes from a previous owner who had
unproductive land or from some public lands that do not have any private owner. The
rural settlers who benet from the agrarian reform usually also receive state assistance to
help with their production. This assistance is usually in the form of subsidized nancing
or technical assistance from the government.
    Historically, the literature has presented an important link between Amazon Rural
Settlements and deforestation. The creation of Rural Settlements, the literature
argues, could increase deforestation for many reasons. First, settlements could increase
population density in the areas where they are located. Second, environmental law in the
Amazon requires that at least 80% of each rural household's land be preserved with native
vegetation. It is usually more dicult for small-scale farmers to keep this percentage of
their land intact as native forest and still produce for the market. When the tract of land
is larger, it is more likely that farmers can meet this requirement. At the same time,
Rural Settlements and agrarian reform in Brazil are usually seen as one of the ways to
reduce poverty and inequality, which raises the dichotomy of social development versus
environmental conservation (Caviglia-Harris and Harris, 2011; Turner, 2007).
    The aim of this paper is to investigate whether state assisted Rural Settlements
contributed to an increase in deforestation in the Amazon between 2002 and 2014.
Conservation policies targeted large deforestation polygons and, depending on the state,
had an impact on large properties; however, there was also a huge increase of settlement
project areas in the Amazon Biome, which jumped from 220 thousand square kilometres
in 2002 to 376 thousand square kilometres in 2014. These settlements are usually large
tracts of land that have been divided into small plots that are distributed to small-scale
farmers with state assistance. These plots are used for crop production, cattle beef
activities, and milk production.
    We intend to identify how these projects expanded in the Amazon region from 2002
to 2014 and whether they were a barrier to the eectiveness of conservation policies.
Have the new settlements created a force pushing to the deforestation direction, and thus
trending away from conservation? Was this force quantitatively important? This paper
intends to address these questions.
    From the 1960s to the 1980s, small-scale farmers with state assistance deforested
large areas of tropical forest in Southeast Asia and Latin America, including the
Amazon. As globalization and urbanization increased during the 1980s, the agents of
deforestation changed in Brazil and Indonesia. Well-capitalized ranchers, farmers, and
loggers, producing for consumers in distant markets, became more prominent in these
places and this globalization weakened the historically strong relationship between local
population growth and forest cover (Rudel et al., 2009).
    This change was reinforced by Brazilian Federal Government policies. Incentives were
created to develop the enterprise agricultural sector, such as: exemptions of agricultural
income from income taxation; rules of public land allocation based on claims that are
more secure when the land is cleared; a progressive land tax that contains provisions


                                            2
that encourage the conversion of forest to crop land or pasture; a tax credit scheme
aimed toward corporate livestock ranches that subsidizes inecient ranches established
on cleared forest land; and subsidized credit available for SUDAM-approved ranches
(Binswanger, 1991; Fearnside, 2005).
    The result of these changes and policies was that large landholders became responsible
for most of Brazilian Amazon deforestation. Pacheco (2012) shows that, in absolute terms,
areas dominated by large and medium landowners clear a higher amount of Amazon forest
than areas dominated by smallholders. However, smallholders are able to keep a smaller
share of their farm as native forest, since they have less land dedicated to agricultural
production. Godar et al. (2014) show that while areas dominated by large landowners
were responsible for 47% of accumulated deforestation in the Amazon, areas dominated
by smallholders were responsible for only 13.9% of Amazon area deforested.
    Property-level analyses are conned to small geographical areas, but also conrm these
results (Walker et al., 2000; D`Antona et al., 2006; Aldrich et al., 2006; Michalski et al.,
2010; Godar et al., 2012). Using data from four dierent municipalities, Walker et al.
(2000) show that the relative participation of large cattle ranching producers depends
on the type of activity predominant in the municipality. In areas designed for Rural
Settlements, with high in-migration of small-scale producers, the relative participation
of large cattle ranchers on deforestation is smaller; however, in areas designed for large
ranching initiatives originally undertaken by SUDAM, the relative participation of large
cattle ranchers could reach as much as 100%.
    These questions became even more important with the introduction of a new set of
conservation policies that targeted large deforestation polygons. Amazon deforestation
rates escalated in the early 2000s, but after peaking at over 27 thousand square kilometres
in 2004, they decreased sharply to about 5 thousand square kilometres in 2014 (INPE
(2015)). The strengthening of Amazon monitoring and law enforcement eorts starting in
2004 was one of the main drivers of this deforestation slowdown (Assun√ß√£o et al., 2013a,
2015a).
    Central to these eorts was the implementation of the remote sensing-based Real-
Time System for Detection of Deforestation (DETER). Yet, the satellite used in DETER
is only capable of detecting forest clearings where the total contiguous area exceeds 0.25
square kilometres. Because DETER is used to target law enforcement activities in the
Amazon, clearings smaller than this threshold are less likely to be caught by law enforcers.
The recent change in deforestation composition suggests that the dynamics of Amazon
forest clearings may have changed in response to DETER's technical shortcoming.
    With this caveat in the monitoring system, Assun√ß√£o et al. (2015b) show that relative
participation of small-scale farmers on total deforestation increased in Par√°, the state with
higher deforestation rates in the Amazon. Godar et al. (2014) also show that command
and control policies implemented in the 2000s reduce deforestation by 81% in areas
dominated by large landowners and by only 73% in areas dominated by smallholders.
Therefore, the importance of settlements to this change in the small-scale agriculture
deforestation become an important research issue.
    Many Rural Settlements are created after invasions of unproductive land by rural
organizations, such as the Landless Movement (Movimento dos Sem-Terra), which
suggests the impact of the judicial insecurity of property rights. In this case, the increase
of Rural Settlements could aect deforestation through this judicial insecurity (Araujo


                                             3
et al., 2009; de Janvry et al., 2015).
    There is also a literature that links population density and roads to deforestation
(Caviglia-Harris and Harris, 2011; Imbernon, 1997; Pfa et al., 2007; Chomitz and
Thomas, 2003). As many of the settlements projects aect the number of people living
in these places and also the infrastructure needed to transport agricultural production,
the settlements could be causing an increase in deforestation.
    Our work also speaks to the literature on the drivers of deforestation. The impact
of socioeconomic and geographic factors on deforestation has long been documented.
Population, road density, climate, rural credit, and agricultural commodity prices, among
others, have been shown to be important drivers of forest clearing activity (Cropper and
Griths, 1994; Panayotou and Sungsuwan, 1994; Andersen, 1996; Barbier and Burgess,
1996; Chomitz and Gray, 1996; Cropper et al., 1997; Angelsen and Kaimowitz, 1999;
Pfa, 1999; Barbier and Burgess, 2001; Ferraz, 2001; Pfa et al., 2007; Chomitz and
Thomas, 2003; Araujo et al., 2009). More recent works have looked specically at the
2000s Amazon slowdown, aiming at disentangling the leading causes of the decrease in
deforestation (Hargrave and Kis-Katos, 2013; Assun√ß√£o et al., 2013b,a; Assun√ß√£o and
Rocha, 2014; Assun√ß√£o et al., 2015a,b).
    We contribute to this literature by showing the impact of policies that could create
incentives for deforestation, such as the creation of new settlements, and partially oset
the impact of conservation policies. We also investigate the heterogeneous eects of Rural
Settlements on deforestation. First, we separate the impact of Rural Settlements, by type
of settlement. Second, we investigate heterogeneous eects depending on the location of
the settlement.
    We use a georreferenced dataset publicized by the National Institute of Colonization
and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) with the area occupied by Rural Settlements, by
settlement type. We merge this dataset with municipality deforestation data obtained
from processed satellite imagery that was made publicly available by the National
Institute for Space Research (INPE).
    We then use a dierence-in-dierence approach to calculate the impact of the share
of municipality area covered by settlements on deforestation. We control for municipality
and time-xed eects, and other variables which could aect deforestation.
    We show that the share of municipality covered by settlements positively aects
deforestation. Quantitatively, using our preferred specication, Rural Settlements are
responsible for 30% of 2014's total deforestation in the Amazon Biome.
    To try to understand the mechanism of the eect of Rural Settlements on deforestation
we calculate some heterogeneous eects. There are four types of Rural Settlements. The
Colonization Rural Settlements (the old ones, with no variation in our sample period), the
conventional Rural Settlements (the more common, managed by INCRA, a federal agency
that takes care of property rights in Brazil), State and Municipal Rural Settlements,
and Special Rural Settlements, which are the ones with some environmental condition.
(These are designed to serve families who wish to work with more sustainable production
techniques, such as using fewer or no pesticides, or with more sustainable extractive
activities, such as sustainable forestry projects).
    We nd that Special Rural Settlements do have a positive and signicant eect on
deforestation. Yet, the location of these settlements were very concentrated in areas with
very high forest coverage and a low rate of deforestation. The idea is that even with the


                                            4
use of sustainable practices, these settlements cause some deforestation. As these areas
had no deforestation before, we identify some increase in deforestation rates in these
municipalities. Special Settlements are responsible for 15% of 2014's total deforestation
in the Amazon Biome.
    Conventional settlements also have a positive but statistically non-signicant eect on
deforestation. This may be because the increase of this type of settlement between 2002
and 2014 was lower than the increase of special settlements, which implies less statistical
power to measure the eect, as we are controlling for xed eects.
    When running OLS estimates we also nd that conventional settlements and
colonization settlements have higher positive correlation with deforestation. But this
correlation is completely spurious. These settlements were located in places where
deforestation is higher today, but not necessarily, because they were there. When
controlling for xed eect both types of settlements become statistically non-signicant
to explain deforestation.
    Therefore, Rural Settlements are causing part of deforestation in the Amazon, as have
been claimed by literature. Our paper, however, takes a step forward and measures the
eect of Rural Settlements on deforestation controlling for many other eects. While
Alencar et al. (2016) shows that deforestation within Rural Settlements represents 30%
of Amazon deforestation, they were not taking into account that those areas could be
deforested even without any Rural Settlement presence. In other words, they were
not isolating the eect of Rural Settlements. Yet, part of deforestation outside Rural
Settlements could be caused by the settlers.
    Our calculation diers from the Alencar et al. (2016) one in two aspects: rst, we
measure the impact of Rural Settlements on deforestation in the Amazon within or
outside Rural Settlements; second, we also isolate the impact of Rural Settlements on
deforestation from the impact of other factors on deforestation.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed description
of the data used in the paper; Section 3 explains the empirical strategy used to calculate
the impact of priority municipalities on deforestation; Section 4 discusses the results of
the paper; and Section 5 addresses the conclusions and policy implications of our results.

2. Data, Descriptive Statistics, and Stylized Facts


   This section introduces the data used in this paper, presents descriptive statistics,
and discusses stylized facts to characterize aggregate trends for our variables of interest.

2.1. Deforestation
    Data on deforestation is built from satellite-based images that are processed at
the municipality level and publicly released by PRODES/INPE. Because PRODES
data is reported annually, we rst convert our municipality-by-month settlement panel
into a municipality-by-year settlement panel. We dene deforestation as the annual
deforestation increment, that is, the area in square kilometers of forest cleared over the
twelve months leading up to August of a given year.1

1
    More precisely, the annual deforestation increment of year t measures the area in square kilometers
    deforested between the 1st of August of t ‚àí 1 and the 31st of July of t.


                                                    5
    For any given municipality, cloud coverage during the period of remote sensing may
compromise the accuracy of satellite images, requiring images to be produced at a dierent
time. As a result, image records for dierent years may span from less to more than twelve
months. To control for measurement error, variables indicating unobservable areas are
included in all regressions. This data is also publicly available at the municipality-by-year
level from 2002 to 2014 from PRODES/INPE.
    To smooth the cross-sectional variation in deforestation that arises from municipality
size heterogeneity, we use a normalized measure of the annual deforestation increment.
The normalization ensures that our analysis considers relative variations in deforestation
increments within municipalities.         The variable is constructed by dividing the
deforestation increment variable by the size of municipality.

2.2. Rural Settlements and Deforestation
    We use data on settlements compiled by the National Institute of Colonization and
Agrarian Reform (INCRA), with information about the area occupied by the settlements,
by type of settlement. We use this information to calculate the total area of settlement
by municipality and build the panel municipality-year from 2002 to 2014.2 .
    To make fair comparisons we consider only Rural Settlements located in the Amazon
Biome. Brazil has deforestation data also from municipalities outside of the Amazon
Biome but within a geopolitical region called Legal Amazon. However, municipalities
outside the Amazon Biome have very dierent vegetation from municipalities within the
Amazon Biome and deforestation problems are concentrated on the Amazon Biome. As
most part of the new settlements were created within the Amazon Biome, we keep only
municipalities in this region.
    Deforestation rates have declined in the Amazon since 2004 and the area occupied by
Rural Settlements has increased. Figure 1 presents the evolution of both deforestation
and Rural Settlements in the Amazon Biome from 2002 to 2014. Notice that deforestation
was 25 thousand square kilometres in 2002 and decreased to around 5 thousand square
kilometres in 2014. At the same time, the area occupied by Rural Settlements increased
from 220 thousand square kilometres in 2002 to 376 thousand square kilometres in 2014.
Despite the opposite direction of the evolution of these two variables, it is important to
verify whether regions where deforestation declined by less were also regions where Rural
Settlements increased by more. We do that in the regressions, testing what happened
with deforestation rates in municipalities where rural settlements increased more.
    We also present in Figure 2 maps that show the evolution of Rural Settlements over
the forest coverage in the Amazon in 2002 and 2011 by settlement type. We present
in the gure only the types with some variation. The area of Colonization Settlements
become stable, and then, we keep them out of the gure. The green area of the map is
the forest coverage. The visual evidence is very impressive for Special Settlements. It is
possible to notice that the area of these settlement types (in red) increases mainly over
the area covered by native forest (in green) between 2002 and 2011. For conventional
settlements the increase in the area is less visible, and it was more uniformly distributed
among municipalities with low and high forest coverage.

    we have data on settlements from 1970 to 2015, but we use in the main calculations only from 2002 to
    2014, which are the years we also have deforestation data

    In summary, the data presented shows that most of INCRA and states and municipal
Rural Settlements created in the 2000s were placed in areas highly covered by rainforests,
in opposition to INCRA claims. As the usual economic activities of producers in
these settlement projects are agricultural activities (usually planted crops and livestock),
deforesting part of the land is inherent to their activities and, therefore, more than
expected. At the same time, these areas are far from the agricultural expansion frontier,
which could mitigate the impact of the creation of settlements on deforestation.
    In the next sections we present evidence that, in fact, INCRA settlements as a whole
have had impact on deforestation. When we divide the impact by settlements types, the
Special Settlements types have had a positive impact on deforestation, while the impact
of the other types are statistically non-signicant.

2.3. Prices and Other Policies
    Agricultural prices are endogenous to local agricultural production. Thus, to control
for uctuations pressuring deforestation at the municipality level, we must construct
output price series that capture exogenous variations in the demand for agricultural
commodities produced locally. As argued in Assun√ß√£o et al. (2015a), agricultural
commodity prices recorded in the southern Brazilian state of Paran√° are highly correlated
with average local crop prices calculated for the Legal Amazon sample municipalities.
Hence, we use the Paran√° agricultural commodity price series weighted by the relative
importance of each product for each municipality production dataset as exogenous
indicators of local market conditions within our empirical context.
    We also use data with information about other conservation policies put into practice
by the Federal Government in the studied period. First, we use the information
about the Priority Municipalities. In 2008, the Federal Government created a list of
municipalities in priority need of prevention and combat to deforestation, named Priority
Municipalities. Secondly, we use data from IBAMA with information about the number
of areas embargoed by IBAMA in each municipality. We use, then, the total number
of embargoes in each municipality as a measure of the intensity of monitoring and law
enforcement at the municipality level.
    These embargoes are often accompanied by other sanctioning instruments, such as
seizure and destruction of production goods, tools and materials, and nes. Because
panel data for the use of these instruments are not available, we use the number of
embargoes as a proxy for command and control eorts as a whole. Essentially, we are
interested in exploring embargoes as a means of capturing the eect of environmental
police (IBAMA) presence, not of the sanctioning instrument itself on deforestation.
    To maintain consistency across our panel data, we consider the PRODES year 
August 1st , t ‚àí 1 through July 31st , t  as the relevant unit of time in our sample. Thus,
for each municipality, the total number of embargoes in a given year captures all nes
applied in that municipality in the twelve months leading up to August of that year. We
use, then, the lag of the number of embargoes to avoid endogeneity problems. We have
information on the lag of embargoes from 2002 to 2014.

3. Empirical Strategy

   In this section we discuss the empirical strategy used in this paper to identify the
eect of Rural Settlements on deforestation. In the Subsection 3.1 we discuss the main

                                             9
strategy used. In Subsection 3.2 we discuss the econometric problems with our estimation
and possible solutions for them.

3.1. Main Strategy
    The challenge faced in this paper is how to adequately measure the impact of Rural
Settlements on deforestation. We have the percentage of the municipality territory
covered by settlements and the percentage of municipality territory deforested each year,
from 2002 to 2014. We, then, use this information to run a dierence-in-dierence
approach with municipality and year xed-eects to get the impact of settlement on
deforestation.
    The strategy has several drawbacks. First, there are many other variables that could
aect the location of Rural Settlements and deforestation at the same time. For example,
many policies created by the Ministry of Environment were active in the Amazon in the
studied period. These policies could also aect both the location of Rural Settlements
and deforestation at the same time.
    Second, another possible problem may be the relationship between agricultural prices
and Rural Settlements. It is well known that agricultural prices aect deforestation
(Assun√ß√£o et al., 2015a). It is also possible that the way in which prices have aected
local production impacts the choice for Rural Settlements location. For example, farmers
could choose locations that are good for planting products if the price is high at the
moment of settlement establishment.
    Finally, our dependent variable is measured with some error because there are some
years that the satellite cannot see the whole Amazon territory and because there are
some parts of the area covered by clouds.
    Fortunately, we have data information and some strategies that allow us to deal with
some of these challenges. First, we have data about other environmental policies, such
as the priority status of each municipality, the number of embargoes per municipality,
and the share of municipality territory covered by protected areas. Second, we have
information on prices. As explained in Section 2.3 we have information about how
commodity prices aect each municipality. Therefore, we can control for price variation
and get the impact of Rural Settlements on deforestation orthogonal to price variation.
Finally, we also have information on the parts of the Amazon that are not observed by
the satellite. Then, we can control for this to mitigate the measurement error.
    However, even controlling for these variables, we still have some concerns about
the exogeneity of the variable. There are many unobservable or even only partially
observed characteristics of the locations that could aect both the establishment of Rural
Settlements and deforestation at the same time. For example, the extension of paved
roads (Cropper et al., 1997), the intensity of other policies, the quality of the soil for
crop production, and the quality of soil for raising cattle. Also, there are some factors
that aect deforestation in all municipalities at the same way, and we could confound the
eect of these factors with the eect of rural settlements on deforestation. We deal with
these problems in three ways.
    First, we control for municipality and year xed eects. Controlling for year xed
eect, we ensure that we are getting the eect isolated from macroeconomic and social
changes. Controlling for municipality xed eects, we solve the problem of the xed
unobservable variables that are aecting Rural Settlements and deforestation, i.e. we


                                           10
ensure that at least the unobservable variables that are not changing with time are not
also driving our results.
    Therefore, our strategy is based in the following equation:


      Def orestit = Œ±i + œÜt + Œ≤1 Settlementsit + Œ≤2 P ricesit + Œ≤3 Climateit + it      (1)

where Def orestit is the share of municipality territory deforested in municipality i and
year t. Our variable of interest, Settlementsit , is the share of municipality territory i
covered by Rural Settlements in year t.
    The term Œ±i represents municipality xed eects, which absorb initial conditions and
persistent municipality characteristics, such as geography and transport infrastructure.
The term œÜt represents year xed eects to control for common time trends, such as
seasonal uctuations in agricultural activity, macroeconomic conditions, common rural
policies, and the political cycle. The term P ricesit proxies for municipality-specic
demand for credit, as it includes annual cattle and crop price indices (current and lagged)
varying over time at the municipality level. Finally, the term Climateit controls for
climate variables, such as rain and temperature. In all specications, standard errors are
robust to arbitrary forms of heteroscedasticity and are clustered at the municipality level
to allow for correlation at a given time, as well as across time within municipalities.

3.2. Econometric Issues
    In the last subsection we explain how we deal with the unobservable problems related
to omitted variables that are xed in time. In this section we explain how we mitigate
the problems related to omitted variables that vary with time. This problem is more
dicult to address.
    In Section 2.2 we show that the area covered by Rural Settlements has increased
more in areas where the territory is highly covered by native forests. Therefore, there
is an endogeneity source in our estimation. For example, municipalities highly covered
by native forests could have dierent deforestation trends compared with municipalities
with little forest coverage. Then, our Rural Settlement coecient could be biased by
the fact that the areas where Rural Settlements have been placed are also areas in
which deforestation is expected to increase more, even without the Rural Settlements
establishment.
    Also, the impact of Rural Settlements on deforestation may be heterogeneous. It is
possible that Rural Settlements in the agricultural frontier region impact deforestation
dierently from Rural Settlements in the middle of the Amazon, which are far from urban
markets, for example.
    We deal with these issues by completing several robustness exercises and also by
allowing impact heterogeneity. First, we run the same regression as in equation 1, but
now we control for an interaction between the share of municipality covered by rainforest
in 2002 and a time trend. This means that we are controlling for a time trend which
depends on the initial levels of native forests in municipalities in our sample. Second we
do the same exercise controlling for a time trend that depends on the initial levels of the
municipality annual deforestation in 2002. The rst measure is a stock measure: it is
possible that the deforestation trend in municipalities with highest percentage of territory


                                            11
already deforested is dierent from the trend in municipalities that was not deforested
too much. The second measure is a ow measure: deforestation trends in municipalities
where economic activities have been intense with high deforestation rates in 2002 could
be dierent from deforestation trends in municipalities where deforestation rates were
low in 2002. Controlling for these interactions of deforestation measures with time trends
ensures that our results have not been driven by these dierent trends.
    Also, to ensure that we are not getting the eect of any other omitted variable we run
placebo tests including leads and lags of the share of municipality covered by settlements.
The leads and lags have dierent interpretation. If the lags of this share is statistically
signicant, this means that the impact of an increase in the settlements area in some
municipality is lasting more than one year, i.e. the increase in settlements area aects
deforestation in the year of the increase, and also in the following years. In the case of
the leads, the exercise works as a placebo test. The leads of the share of municipality
covered by settlements should not impact deforestation. Unless the case in which farmers
are clearing the area before invade the land, increasing they chance to get the land title
according to Brazilian rules. However, preliminary analysis in descriptive statistics shows
that settlements have been created in areas with a lot of forest and few deforestation, not
the opposite. In any case, if the leads are statistically signicant, this means that either
we have an endogeneity problem in our estimation or farmers have deforested the area
before settlements creation.
    To calculate the heterogeneity of the impact, we also run the main regression
considering alternative samples. First we keep only municipalities within a distance of
200, 300, and 400 kilometres from the Amazon Biome border, which is the area known
as deforestation arc, or the agricultural expansion frontier. That means, we keep only
municipalities near to agricultural expansion frontier. Second, we also do the opposite,
and keep only municipalities far from the agricultural expansion frontier. In this case,
we keep only municipalities with a minimum distance of 200 kilometres from the Biome
border.
    These tests with alternative samples serve also as robustness checks. Our results may
have been driven by the fact that Rural Settlements increased more in municipalities
where deforestation was always very small in our sample. When comparing this
municipalities with other municipalities where deforestation was always very high we
could be comparing apples with oranges. Then, restrict our samples could help us to
compare similar municipalities, some of them with high increase of Rural Settlements
coverage and some of them with low increase in Rural Settlements coverage.
    Finally, the impact is also probably dierent depending on the type of Rural
Settlements.     "Conventional Rural Settlements"are dierent from "Special Rural
Settlements,"which are also dierent from "State and Municipal Rural Settlements."We
present estimation separating the eect of each type of Rural Settlement on deforestation.

4.1. The Impact of Rural Settlements on Deforestation
    Rural Settlements are expected to have a positive relationship with deforestation. In
Section 2 we show that Rural Settlements were created in municipalities with a higher
share of territory covered by native forests. Then, when the settlement is created, we
suppose farmers deforesting part of their land for agricultural production (crop plantation,
cattle activities, or both) and forestry activities.
    We start our analysis by presenting the numbers of the evolution of Rural Settlements
by type and by repeating the numbers of settlements and deforestation in Table 1. It is
possible to see that the area of special settlements increased more relative to the other
settlement types. We also use these numbers to interpret quantitatively the coecient of
our regressions in the following tables.
    Table 2 presents the results of the estimation of Equation 1. Column 1 shows the
results of the regression of deforestation on Rural Settlements by OLS, controlling only
for time xed eect. In Column 2, we control for municipality xed eects. In Column 3,
we also control for prices and policies. In Column 4, we add an interaction of time trends
with initial forest coverage and with initial annual deforestation. In Column 5, we test
the eects of the lead and the lag of Rural Settlement variable
    Initial analysis of Columns 1, 2, and 3 point to a positive relationship between
Rural Settlements and deforestation. In Column 1 we run an OLS regression. The
positive coecient means that municipalities where the presence of Rural Settlements
is higher are also municipalities with higher deforestation rates. However, when we
control for municipality xed eects, the coecient is even higher. This means that
municipalities where the area of Rural Settlements increased more were also the areas
where deforestation increased more during our sample period. In Column 3 we control
for prices and policies and the coecient decreases but remains positive and statistically
signicant.
    However, we did not account for the possible endogeneity problem yet. Could

deforestation in these municipalities be higher even if Rural Settlements were not there?
We attempt to answer this question by analyzing columns 4 and 5. We showed in
Section 2 data that most of the new Rural Settlements created between 2002 and 2011
were located in municipalities where forest coverage was very high and deforestation
was very low in 2002. Therefore, these municipalities could have trends very dierent
from municipalities with low forest coverage and high deforestation rates. For example,
conservation policies against deforestation targeted places with high deforestation rates.
Therefore, municipalities with lower deforestation rates in 2002 could being reducing less
deforestation because they were not targeted by policy as much as municipalities with
higher deforestation rates that year.
    To deal with these problems we run the same regressions, but now we control for
two kind of trends. First, we include a time trend interacted with the initial level of
forest coverage. The idea here is that municipalities with higher initial levels of forest
coverage would reduce deforestation by less than municipalities with lower levels of forest
coverage. Second, we control for a time trend interacted with initial levels of annual
deforestation. The idea here is that municipalities with high deforestation rates may
reduce more deforestation than municipalities with low deforestation rates, especially in
a period where policies become tougher and commodity prices become less attractive.
Because the increase in Rural Settlements was concentrated in these areas (with high
initial forest coverage and high initial annual deforestation), we may be confounding the
eect of these trends with the eect of Rural Settlements.
    Our preferred specication then is, in Column 4, where we control for municipality
xed eects, for prices, policies, and the trends. The coecient remains positive and
statistically signicant. Quantitatively, an increase of 1 p.p. in the municipality territory
covered by Rural Settlements increases 0.004 p.p. in the share of municipality territory

                                                        14
annual deforested. In other words, considering that Rural Settlements occupied 8.32% of
Amazon Biome in 2014, our results mean that Rural Settlements are responsible for 30%
of deforestation in the Amazon Biome in 2014.
    We interpret these results as a sign that Rural Settlements are causing deforestation.
In the next section we separate the eect of each kind of Rural Settlement on deforestation
and shed light on what is happening in previous table.

4.2. Dierent Rural Settlement Types
    In this section we measure the eect of each kind of Rural Settlement on deforestation.
In the last section we showed that Rural Settlements have a positive eect on
deforestation. In this subsection we investigate which type of Rural Settlement is causing
more deforestation. It is possible that some types of Rural Settlements have an eect on
deforestation and other types do not. In this section we investigate this possibility.
    Table 3 presents regressions analyzing this question. In Column 1 we run deforestation
on types of Rural Settlements by OLS, controlling for time xed eect as in previous
table, but not controlling for municipality xed eect. The results are as expected. The
"old"Rural Settlements, that means, the types of Rural Settlements more frequently in
the past (Colonization and Conventional Rural Settlements), have positive correlation
with deforestation. Municipalities in the frontier of agricultural expansion with high
deforestation rates are the municipalities where these two types of Rural Settlements
occupy a higher area. The "new"Rural Settlements, which means the Rural Settlements
that become more frequently established more recently, such as special settlements, have
a negative correlation with deforestation. This means they were created in municipalities
with lower deforestation rates, although the coecient is not signicant.
    In Column 2, we control for municipality xed eect. The results change completely.
In this case, we cannot have the coecient of Colonization Settlements because there
was no variation of this type of settlement during our sample period. The coecient
of Conventional Rural Settlements is not signicant anymore. We interpret this result
in the following way. Usually, the literature has pointed to a correlation between Rural
Settlements and deforestation; our results show that, considering the old types of Rural
Settlements (Colonization and Conventional), this relationship is really only a correlation.
There is more deforestation in areas where these Rural Settlements are placed only
because they were placed in areas that today are on the agricultural expansion frontier.
When controlling for xed eects, we show that the increase in conventional Rural
Settlements has no signicant eect on deforestation.
    However, the coecients on special Rural Settlements are positive and signicant.
That means municipalities where the area covered by these Rural Settlements increased
were also the municipalities where deforestation increased more (or decreased less). To
ensure that we are not attributing the eect of other factors to settlements, we again
control for prices and policies (column 3), and for trends depending on initial forest
coverage and on initial annual deforestation (Column 4). The results in Column 4 are
similar to the results in Column 2.
    Quantitatively interpreting this coecient, we can say that only the Special
Settlements are responsible for 15% of deforestation in the Amazon Biome in 2014.
    As a robustness check, we also test if our result is coming from some Special
Settlements deforestation pre-trend. It is possible that deforestation was already

increasing (or decreasing less) in municipalities where special settlements have been
created. Then, we run the same regression as in Column 4, adding a lead and a lag
of the share of municipality territory covered by special settlements. The results are
presented in Column 5. It's possible to see that the variable representing the lead of
special settlements coverage is not signicant to explain deforestation. That means,
there is no pre-trends explaining the coecient of special settlements. At the same time,
when including a lead and a lag of Special Settlements, is possible to see that they only
have some eect on deforestation one year after their creation.
    Summarizing, the only type of Rural Settlements in which the eect on deforestation
survives the robustness checks is the Special Settlements, which are settlements with a
focus on some environmental condition. The result is a puzzle. What is the mechanism
behind these results? How could Rural Settlements with environmental conditions be the
only type to have an eect on deforestation?
    Table 4 helps to shed light on this question. To test the heterogeneity of the eect
we restrict our sample in four ways to try to understand what is really happening with
deforestation rates in places where Rural Settlements have increased. In Columns 1 and
2 we restrict our sample to the region closest to the Amazon Biome border. This region
is the one known as the deforestation arc, the agricultural expansion frontier. In Column
1 we keep only municipalities within 200 kilometres of distance to the Biome border and
in Column 2 we keep municipalities within 300 kilometres of distance to the Amazon
Biome border. In Columns 3 and 4 we do the opposite. In Column 3 we keep only
municipalities with a distance higher than 200 kilometres to the Biome Border, and in

Column 4 we keep only municipalities with more than 300 kilometres of distance from
the Biome border. These municipalities are the ones located more in the interior of the
Amazon, far from the main marketplaces for agricultural products.
    All the results show a positive and signicant eect of Special Rural Settlements
on deforestation. Quantitatively, the results could be interpreted in the following way:
while one more square kilometre of a Special Rural Settlement in municipalities near to
the Amazon Biome border causes more deforestation than one more square kilometre
in municipalities far from the border, very few Special Settlements were created in this
region. Then, Special Rural Settlements are responsible for only 4% of deforestation in
the region known as the deforestation arc, the region closer to the Biome border (result
from Column 1).
    In the other hand, in regions far from the Amazon Biome Border one more square
kilometres of Special Settlements have a smaller impact on deforestation. However, the
area occupied by Special Rural Settlements in this region is very large. Therefore, Special
Rural Settlements are responsible for around 20% of the deforestation in this region
(results from Columns 2, 3 and 4).
    The interpretation of this results is that INCRA has created settlements in regions
far from the deforestation arc, regions with very few deforestation and with a lot of
forest coverage. Then, even the impact of each square kilometre of these settlements
on deforestation in this regions being small, the increase in the Rural Settlement area
was so large that the impact represents an important fraction of deforestation in the
region. To establish agricultural activities in this region, even with sustainable practices,
farmers need a tract of cleared land to produce, unless they are engaged only in extractive
activities.
    Summarizing this nding, the only type of Rural Settlement with signicant eect
on deforestation is the Special Settlement. The eect is present mainly in municipalities

far from the marketplaces and the agricultural expansion frontier. Traditional Rural
Settlements (Conventional Settlements and state and municipal Rural Settlements) seem
to have no eect on deforestation. The correlation that the literature has identied
between conventional settlements and deforestation seems to be related to omitted
variables that aect deforestation and also the creation of these Rural Settlements.
However, we nd an important eect of Special Rural settlements on deforestation.
Quantitatively, we nd that the whole set of Rural Settlements are responsible for 30%
of deforestation on the Amazon Biome, a number very closed to the number found by
the literature.

5. Conclusion


    The new composition of deforestation in the Amazon, with a higher relative
participation of small-scale deforested polygons, has concerned environmental specialists
and policy makers. Policies that aect these small-scale farmers and related institutions
have, therefore, been an important issue under consideration by policy makers and
researchers.
    Since the 1970s, Rural Settlements with state assistance have been one of the several
strategies of the Federal Government in Brazil to colonize remote regions with low
population. However, it was between 2002 and 2014 that the greatest increase in
Rural Settlements area occurs in the Amazon region, jumping from 220 thousand square
kilometres in 2002 to 376 thousand square kilometres in 2014, an increase of 70
    This paper shows that most part of this increase in Rural Settlements area in the
Amazon Region was located in remote areas with low population, such as the state of
Amazonas, and in municipalities with high forest coverage. Yet, usually, the settlements
were created in municipalities where conservation eorts have not arrived, possibly
because they are municipalities with few deforestation activities.
    The paper also shows that the newly created Rural Settlements had a positive and
statistically signicant eect on deforestation. Quantitatively, we present evidence that
Rural Settlements are responsible for 30% of current deforestation in the Amazon Biome.
However, separating the eect by settlement type, the Special Settlement, which is a type
of settlement with some environmental condition was the only type with a positive and
signicant eect on deforestation.
    In light of this, our analysis has important implications for the design of public policy
in Brazil. It has shown that the new set of Rural Settlements created between 2002 and
2014 has an important impact on deforestation, and our analysis isolated this impact
from other variables to show that the Special Settlements possibly aect deforestation
the most.
