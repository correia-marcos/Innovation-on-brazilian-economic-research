    This paper is a …rst step to understanding the relationship between credit market imperfections
and inequality of opportunity in skill formation.The main goal is to identify the e¤ects of the credit
constraint on the optimal decision to human capital, in terms of degree of instruction, taking into
account the household preferences for education. Our starting point is the theoretical model of
Lochner & Monge-Naranjo (2011). Following their model, we propose a reduced form approach
that estimates the relation between education decision and initial wealth in Brazil. This empirical
analysis is conducted using data from a Brazilian Household Budget Survey (POF), for years 2002-
2003 and 2008-2009. Our results point out that education decision is in fact credit constrained.
The empirical estimates show a strong and highly signi…cant e¤ect of wealth on educational level of
children, teenagers and adults, even controlling by education expenditures. On average, the initial
wealth was responsible for an increase of more than 5 years of schooling. But we …nd no evidence of
credit constraint on high level education decision, like undergraduate and graduate levels.
                                                   Resumo
    Este artigo é um primeiro passo para entender a relação entre imperfeições do mercado de crédito
e desigualdade de oportunidades na formação de habilidades.O objetivo principal é identi…car os
efeitos da restrição de crédito sobre a decisão ótima de investimento em capital humano, em termos
de grau de instrução, controlando pelas preferências pela educação do domicílio. O ponto de partida
é o modelo teórico de Lochner & Monge-Naranjo (2011). Seguindo seu modelo, propõe-se uma
abordagem na forma reduzida para estimar a relação entre a decisão de educação e riqueza inicial
no Brasil. Esta análise empírica é realizada utilizando dados das Pesquisas de Orçamento Familiar
do Brasil (POF), para os anos 2002-2003 e 2008-2009. Os resultados encontrados indicam que a
decisão sobre investimento em educação enfrenta, de fato, restrições de crédito. As estimativas
empíricas mostram um efeito forte e altamente signi…cativo da riqueza sobre o nível educacional
de crianças, adolescentes e adultos, mesmo controlando por gastos com educação. Em média, a
riqueza inicial é responsável por um aumento de mais de 5 anos de escolaridade. Entretanto, não
há nenhuma evidência de restrição de crédito sobre a decisão de investimento em ensino superior ou
pós-graduação.

1     Introduction
Historically, poverty has been a persistent phenomenon, a process whose change is very slow. The
characteristics of poverty often generate determinants based on "sticky" variables or indicators that
is resistant to change, such as resource allocation and geographic factors (location, climate, soil
quality). However, the fact that there have been signi…cant shifts in the levels of poverty in some
countries or regions, makes explanations necessary for such changes (Lipton & Ravaillion, 1995;
Besley & Burgess, 1998).
    In this sense, poverty can be seen, for example, as a result of the market failures (Banerjee &
Newman , 1993), as arising from the institutions, the way societies are organized (Acemoglu et al.,
2002), or merely as a result of the initial allocations of natural resources, climate, soil characteristics,
and other geographical determinants (Gallup et al.,1999).
    From the point of view of individual behavior and family decisions, the economic literature has
stressed that the credit market imperfections is one of the necessary ingredients to the occurrence of
the poverty trap - the fact that families are poor for being poor in prior periods or having originated
from other poor families. The lack of resources needed to …nance the investment limits the ability of
families to escape from poverty (Galor & Zeira , 1993; Banerjee & Newman, 1993; Ghatak & Jiang,
2002). On an aggregate perspective, the disability creates an ine¢ ciency, since the poor can not
get out of their condition of poverty not because they are less productive or lacking the necessary
quali…cations, but simply because market imperfections restrains the full realization of their potential
(Deininger, 1999).
    Family decisions concerning education, health and fertility are intrinsically related. Poor families
typically have many children and invest little in education and health of children. These characteris-
tics of poor families reduce the likelihood that they come out of poverty when they reach adulthood.
This perverse interaction results in the reproduction of poverty and inequality across generations.
One of its fundamental cause is the inability of poor families to ensure a minimally satisfactory level
of consumption and, at the same time, su¢ cient income to keep children in school and to invest
adequately in family health. This problem is particularly intensi…ed by the lack of access to credit
by poor households. Without access to credit, investments in health and education of children are
not happening even when, from a purely …nancial perspective, they would be pro…table (or better,
the impact of investments in health and education on the future income of the child would be more
than su¢ cient to pay the investments). In this context, if the family had access to credit, she may
decide to have fewer children and invest more in education and health of each child, which would
open the possibility that the next generation escape poverty.
    Based on this context, the present work focuses on identifying the e¤ects of the credit constraint
on the optimal decision to human capital, in terms of degree of instruction, taking into account the
household preferences for education. Its is just a …rst step in order to understanding the relationship
between imperfections in credit market and inequality of opportunity in skill formation.
    Our results point out that education decision is in fact credit constrained. The empirical estimates
show a strong and highly signi…cant e¤ect of wealth on educational level of children, teenagers and
adults, even controlling by education expenditures. The remainder of the paper is organized as follow.
Section 2 presents a brief review of imperfections in the credit market and their e¤ect on individual
decisions, specially those related to education. Section 3 brings the theoretical model. Section 4 is
concerned about data base and empirical strategy. Section 5 discusses the results and, …nally, section
6 reports the main conclusions and make the …nal comments.

2    Literature Review
The imperfections in the credit market are usual associated with asymmetric information. Ja¤e &
Russel (1976) explain the constraints in the credit market using the basic ideas of moral hazard
and adverse selection. They build a model in which there are two types of borrowers, honest and
dishonest. Honest borrowers accept only loan contracts and they can pay; and dishonest borrowers
default if the cost of default is low. The lenders know that there are two types of borrowers in the
market, but they do not have any prior information about the type of a borrower. If they lend a
great amount of money or increase the interest rate, they can attract only the dishonest borrowers.
With the purpose of avoiding adverse selection, they decrease the interest rate and limited the
amount of credit in the market. Stiglitz & Weiss (1981) use the same principles to explain credit
constraints. These authors show how the incentives in the market can a¤ect not only the type of
potential borrowers (adverse selection), but also the behavior of the borrowers in the market (moral
hazard). One of the drawbacks of these studies is that they explain adverse selection and moral
hazard problems in the credit market using only changes in the interest rate. This approach is too
simple since the credit markets are regulated by speci…c institutions and other mechanisms used in
this market, like collateral, can be related to adverse selection and moral hazard.
    Stiglitz & Weiss (1981) and Bell (1988) study how the collateral is related to the design of the
contracts in the credit market. If borrowers can o¤er a collateral that exceeds the principal, there
is full guarantee and no credit constraints. However, if the lenders request high value collateral, the
contract may attract only the borrowers that are willing to invest in high risk project with a higher
return. Even in the presence of the collateral, credit constraints can exist.
    In this research, we relate credit constraint with the risk of a contract default. The household
with low wealth that do not have the initial capital to start a new project need to borrow money in
the credit market. Given the asymmetric information in the credit market, the lenders will requires
some loan guarantees, like a collateral. The low wealth individuals could not provide these guarantees
and have access to a limited amount of credit, as a consequence they cannot invest in projects that
have higher returns.
    Another side of literature assume that there are credit constraints and study the impact of
these constraints on investment, and how these constraints can explain the income inequality and
poverty in some countries. Banerjee & Newman (1991) and Banerjee & Newman (1993) relate credit
constraints with income inequality. In the …rst paper, the authors understand credit constraints as
a consequence of …nancial contract incentives. The insurance of a high risk contract with higher
return is not possible because of "moral hazard", and the low-income households have limited access
to credit, and cannot invest in human capital or projects with higher return. This limited access to
credit is related with the persistence of income inequality. In the other paper, Banerjee & Newman
relate credit constraints with occupational choice and income inequality. Aghion & Bolton (1997)
study credit constraints in a moral hazard framework like in Banerjee & Newman (1991). In their
model, the level of e¤ort of an individual in a project is a decreasing function of the size of the loan.
The agents are risk neutral, and they face a limited amount of credit in the market. These four studies
understand the imperfections in the credit market as an asymmetric information problem. These
imperfections can be of two types: limited credit for certain individuals or a higher risk premium
applied to the amount borrowed. In this market, the low income individuals could not provide the
guarantees requested to obtain the initial capital to start a high return project, and consequently,
they invest in projects with low return. Limited access to credit is one of the mechanism that can
be used to explain the persistence of income inequality.
    Other papers investigate how credit constraints are related to the productivity of certain groups
using household surveys or data about small businesses. Rosenweig & Wolpin (1993) analyze how
the small land owners in India are a¤ected by credit constraints. They develop a dynamic model
in which the investment decisions are related to main characteristics of the small rural owners in

India: small income and limited credit. The results of this model indicate low productivity and low
pro…t are consequences of risk averse individual with low wealth and limited credit, and that credit
constraints also increase the income volatility of these individuals.
    Using a di¤erent approach, Kochar (1995) also investigates credit constraints in the rural market
in India. The author investigates if the rural households in India face constraints that are related
to the formal rules that regulates the access to formal credit. He considers that there are two credit
markets in India: a formal one and an informal market. The demand for formal credit can be low
not only because of the rules that limited the participation of the rural population in this market,
but also because the informal credit is a good substitute for the formal credit, and in the informal
market the cost of transactions are lower than in the formal one. Another study about the credit
market in rural India is Jacoby & Skou…as (1997). This study focuses on the relationship between
the credit constraints and the accumulation of human capital. They investigate if credit constraints
are related to child labor in India. If low income households have limited access to the formal and
informal credit market, when the household income is very low, children in the rural households in
India have to work to help at home. The consequences of child labor in India is low educational level,
less accumulation of human capital and low productivity in the region. Towsend (2002) analyzes the
credit market in Thailand. Using a household survey, the author provides evidence that there are
credit constraints, and relates these constraints with income inequality and poverty. Ardagna &
Lusardi (2008) use micro data that has information of individuals in di¤erent countries to estimate
the determinants of entrepreneurship. They …nd that one of the main determinants are regulation,
measure by the barriers and costs entrepreneurs face to open a new business, the e¢ ciency of the
justice system in resolving commercial disputes, and others.
    There are still few studies that examine the direct relationship between asymmetric in credit and
investment in human capital market. Carneiro & Heckman (2002) identify the short-term e¤ects
and long-term e¤ects of credit constraints on the probability of entering university. The long term
e¤ects are related to the fact that low income families can not invest in their children’s education
from early childhood education, leading to a non-development of non-cognitive abilities of the same.
This lack of noncognitive skills as well as the lack of resources for university entrance decrease the
likelihood of students in these poor families to get an undergraduate degree. The authors show
evidence that the e¤ects of long-term credit constraints are stronger than the short-term e¤ects.
Mimoun (2008) estimates the e¤ect of credit constraints in enrollment in higher education, using a
database that contains information on various countries. He presents evidence that credit market
restrictions negatively a¤ect investment in human capital. Cameron & Tabel (2004) show evidence
that the restrictions in the credit market do not generate large ine¢ ciencies in the educational market
and partnerships to improve access to the credit market in the United States public policy would not
have had a signi…cant e¤ect on the education acquired by the Americans.
    In Brazil, the number of papers on the credit market and its relation to individual decisions is still
quite restricted. Based on the Brazilian Household National Survey (PNAD) for the years 1981 to
2001, Assunção & Alves (2007) present empirical evidence that the restrictions in the credit market
has impact on intra-household decisions, like investment in education and child labor. Assunção &
Chein (2007) analyze the credit conditions of families living in rural areas in Brazil. The authors
suggest strong evidence of credit rationing in these areas. In the same line, Madeira et al. (2010)
analyze the e¤ects of recent changes in the Brazilian legal system that worked to minimize credit
enforcement’s reliance on sluggish courts and the assorted risks and costs associated with litigations.
Their results suggest robust e¤ects of the new credit instrument in two kind of decisions: i) on the
probability of engagement on entrepreneurial activities both by pensioners and their family members,
and; ii) ownership of durable consumption goods.
    Given the importance of credit market and human capital on development, in this article we
investigate if credit constraint has an e¤ect on optimal decision to education investment.

3     Theoretical Model
In this section, we present a very simple model that motivates our empirical strategy. Based on
Lochner & Monge-Naranjo (2011), we propose a simple model in which individuals live only two
periods. In the …rst period, they invest in schooling; and in the second period, they work. Their
preferences depend on consumption in both periods and is represented by

                                             U = u (c0 ) + u (c1 )
where ct is consumption on period t, and > 0. The function u (:) is strictly concave and increasing.
    In period 1, each individual can choose three schooling levels: elementary school, high school or
college. In our model, the school level is represented by h, h 2 f0; 1; 2g. Individual starts life with
an initial wealth W     0 and certain level of ability a 0. In our model, initial wealth represents
family transfers and ability captures childhood investments. We follow Lochner and Monge-Naranjo
(2011) and take (W; a) as given.
    The income level of each individual in period 1 (y) depends on the level of school that he/she
chooses in period 0 (h) ;

                                              y = wh a f (h)
where f (:) is positive, strictly increasing and concave, wh is the price of human capital. We assume
that the price of education is increasing in its level.
    In addition, each unit of human capital has a …nancial cost denoted by . The marginal and
total return of investment in human capital increases with ability. Individual can borrow d at a gross
interest rate R > 0. There is a cap in the amount of debt that the individual can accumulate, d d,
where 0 d 1.
    In period 0, individual’s consumption will depend on initial wealth, the cost of the human capital
and the amount borrowed,
                                             c0 = W     h+d
    In period 1, individual’s consumption is given by,

                                             c1 = wh af (h)            Rd

    Individuals choose h, d to maximize his utility subject to the three constraints,

                                             max u (c0 ) + u (c1 )
                                             (h;d)


subject to
                                                         d       d
                                              c0 = W                 h+d
                                             c1 = wh af (h)            Rd
    The …rst order conditions of this problem are:
                         0                                   0                        0
                    h : u (W      h + d) (      ) + u (wh af (h)             Rd) wh af (h) = 0
                             0                       0
                      d : u (W      h + d) + u (wh af (h)                  Rd) ( R)       1   =0
    If the credit constraint is binding,
                                                 d (W; a) = d




                                                             4
    and the optimal level of human capital is given by
                                    0
                               wh af (h )                       1
                                            =R+
                                                      u0 (wh af (h )   Rd )

  In this case, there is a level of wealth that determines who is constrained, Wmin (a). If W <
Wmin (a), the individual is constrained. The optimal level of schooling is implicit determined by:
                     0                                0                         0
                    u (W      h + d) ($ + ) = u (wh af (h )            Rd) wh af (h )
    When the constraint is binding, the optimal amount of human capital investment is strictly
increasing on initial wealth and borrowing limit d. Constrained individuals underinvest in human
capital.
    If the credit constraint is not binding, the optimal level of human capital is given by
                                                  0
                                            wh af (h )
                                                          =R

    In this case, the schooling level does not depend on the initial wealth.


4     Database and Empirical Strategy
According to the IBGE (2006), Household Budget Surveys ("Pesquisa de Orçamentos Familiares
- POF") are intended to measure, based on representative samples of the target population, the
structure of consumption, spending and household income. Thus, it is possible, from the POF, assess
living conditions based on budgets. In addition to information regarding the budget framework, a
diversity of the household and families characteristics are investigated, expanding the potential use of
the research results. It is therefore possible to study the composition of household spending by classes
of income and regional disparities, urban areas among themselves and between urban and rural areas,
the role and extent of household debt, the spread and volume of transfers between di¤erent classes
of income and the size of the consumer market for product groups and services.
    The POF provides information broken down into four separate questionnaires: the household,
collectively spending, personal spending and income. In the questionnaires of households, data on
the characteristics of households and their residents are presented. Among this information, there
are the living conditions and personal characteristics such as age and education level. In income
and expenditures questionnaires there are detailed information about the main occupations and
incomes of individuals, as well as data referring to di¤erent types of expenditures made by households,
for example, expenditures on food, entertainment, transport, culture and education. The units of
analysis of POF are individuals and consumption units.
    The choice of POF as our data source relies on the fact that it is a database still not explored
to evaluate issues related to credit rationing and investment in human capital. Most of the national
literature investigates the issue using information collected by the Census and the National Household
Survey (PNAD). Thus, the use of POF becomes important as it adds new evidence to credit constraint
in Brazil. In this paper we use data from the two most recent surveys, that is, the POF from years
2002-2003 and from 2008-2009.
    The …rst step of our empirical strategy is the de…nition of the wealth variable that we are going
to use here. Our wealth variable is a index composed of 21 variables concerning living conditions and
access to durable goods. This index is constructed using principal component analysis as reported
in Table 1 and was normalized to vary between 0 and 1. All variables referring to durable goods is
measured as the total number of each kind of good, considering the inventory and purchases.

   The distribution of wealth index for years 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 are depicted, respectively, on
Graph 1 and Graph 2. We observe a concentration of individuals on the lower tail of the distribution,
which level of wealth is below 0.5. We observe the same pattern in 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 surveys.

          Graph 4: Distribution of Average Household Expenditures per Wealth - 2008-2009

    While Graph 3 and Graph 4 bring us information about spendings on education, revealing that
preference for education seems to increase with wealth, Graph 5 and Graph 6 show a clearly increase
in average human capital stock as we move from the lowest decile of wealth to highest one. It is

    For preschool we considered children aged 4-7 years old; for elementary level we taking into account only students
aged 14-18, in the case of high school, we include studentes aged 17 to 25. For undergraduate we considered studantes
aged 21 or more. Finally, in graduation all students aged 23 or more was included.

    Just to complement the analysis above, Graphs 7 and 8 depict the smoothed relation between
years of schooling and the wealth index. We can clearly observe an increase in schooling along the
distribution of wealth index.

    To sum up, the descriptive analysis of data points to a positive relation between human capital
investment and wealth. Additional graphs of smoothed educational level attainment are presented
in the appendix.
    Based on the theoretical model presented in section 3, we propose an empirical strategy that
relates the level of schooling of each individual with his/her initial wealth. If we …nd that initial
wealth has a signi…cant relationship with school levels, we have evidence that individuals face credit
constraint. Our estimates reported on Table 3 and Table 4 refers to the following equation:

where e is the optimal education decision (educational level attainment per speci…c ages or years of
schooling), W is our measure of initial wealth, Wi Dy is a interaction between a dummy variable

emphasizing that there is an decrease on credit constraint in the case of preschool, high school level
and of education attainment of individuals aged 25 years or more. On the other hand, we also …nd
evidence of an increase of credit constraint between 2002-2003 to 2008-2009 on education decision,

   In other to better understand the results and evaluate the existence of credit constraint, table
4 shows the average marginal e¤ects of wealth and their signi…cance. All estimates are made at
the mean value of wealth. The analysis of data reported on Table 4 points to a strong credit
constraint before undergraduate level. For example, an increase of one unit of wealth will increase
the probability of a child to have preschool on 0.544. Moreover, the e¤ect of credit constraint of
education attainment of individuals aged 25 or more corresponds to 5.8 years of schooling.

            Table 4: Average Marginal E¤ects of Wealth on Human Capital Investment
    It is worth mentioning that the absence of credit constraint on high level education decisions can
be related to the high quality of several public universities in Brazil as well as to the recent education
policies focused on the access of needy students to public and private undergraduate schools or
graduate courses.


6     Conclusion
In this paper we explore the e¤ect of wealth index on education level attainment and years of schooling
in order to investigate if individuals in Brazil face credit constraint on education decision. Following
the theoretical model of Lochner & Monge-Naranjo (2011), we propose an empirical strategy based
on a reduced form estimate of the relation between wealth index and optimal education decisions.
    Our results point that human capital investment decision is in fact constrained by the wealth.
On average, the wealth was responsible for an increase of more that 5 years of schooling. It is also
important to note that we did not …nd evidence of credit constraint concerning the undergradute
and graduate levels.
    Further steps of this study includes the development of an structural empirical model, that
will help us to better identify a causal relationship between wealth and human capital investment
decisions.
    The …ndings of this study are very important to shed some light on the e¢ ciency and scope
of recent Brazilian policies that focus on educational …nancial aid, like FIES (Student Financing
Fund -"Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil") PROUNI (University for All Program "Programa
Universidade para Todos"), and on the increase in the number of students in the Federal Universities.
