RESUMO: São Paulo é a maior cidade do Hemisfério Sul, com aproximadamente 12 milhões de habitantes
que realizam por volta de 25 milhões de deslocamentos por dia. Seu sistema de transporte público (ônibus
e metrô) agrega 25% delas, sendo notavelmente importante, especialmente para seus usuários frequentes –
pessoas pobres cuja mobilidade pode depender dele. A Prefeitura de São Paulo gasta quase 7% de seu
orçamento em subsídios aos ônibus, um número que cresceu 61% nos últimos quatro anos, uma vez que os
custos são crescentes e a tarifa permanece estagnada em termos reais desde 2005. O presente trabalho visa
calcular a elasticidade preço da demanda por ônibus em São Paulo, uma informação importante para
responder se o preço da tarifa é eficiente em manter o ônibus acessível monetariamente e, eventualmente,
em fazer com que usuários troquem o carro próprio pelo transporte público – isso é: permitir a mobilidade
das pessoas e melhorar a sustentabilidade da cidade. Para tal, dois Modelos de Escolha Discreta são
estimados para os anos de 1997 e 2007, usando a pesquisa de Origem e Destino do Metrô; eles fornecem a
elasticidade de curto prazo dos modais. A implantação do Bilhete Único (2004), então, é considerada um
choque exógeno no preço dos deslocamentos que utilizam mais de um ônibus e utilizada como oportunidade
de estimação da elasticidade de longo prazo. Os resultados sugerem que a demanda por ônibus é preço-
inelástica tanto no curto, quanto no longo prazo, o que corrobora a literatura prévia existente.


ABSTRACT: São Paulo is the biggest city in South Hemisphere, with almost 12 million inhabitants that
make around 25 million trips per day. Its transit system (bus and subway) accounts for 25% of those trips
and is remarkably important, especially for its heavy users - poor people whose mobility might depend on
it. The local government spends almost 7% of its budget in bus’ subsidies, a figure that grew by 61% in the
last four years, since costs are increasing and fare remains stagnated in real terms since 2005. The present
work aims to calculate the price elasticity of bus demand in São Paulo, an important information to answer
whether the fare is efficient in maintaining bus affordability and eventually shifting car commuters to transit
- that is, keeping people’s mobility and enhancing city’s sustainability. In order to do so, two Discrete
Choice Models are estimated for the years of 1997 and 2007, using a household survey on commuting we
estimate short-term elasticity. Then, Bilhete Único implementation (2004) is considered an exogenous
shock on trips’ cost for those using two buses or more on their commuting and used as an opportunity for
estimating long-term elasticity. The results suggest that bus demand is inelastic with respect to price both
in the short and the long term, which corroborates previous literature.

INTRODUCTION
In 1872, São Paulo was 318 years old and its population was 31,385. The village, composed by “poorly
hedged hovels, unpaved streets, puddles, few people on the street, animals sleeping by the corners” (Toledo,
2015, p. 16) began to be crossed by trams – actually, donkey-drawn vehicles, whose replacement by electric
trams started in 1899. 82 years later, in 1954, São Paulo’s 2.9 million inhabitants eclipsed Rio de Janeiro’s
and it became Brazil’s largest city – and still it is.
        Nowadays, São Paulo (SP) is a global city, a financial centre that accounts for 12% of Brazil’s GDP.
It is home to 12 million people and the heart of a 20.7 million people conurbation of 39 municipalities - the
Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP). As in many other metropolises around the world - especially
when fast growth caused urban sprawl -, mobility is an issue and not rarely the traffic is the subject of
conversations in elevators (usually following comments about the weather). And moving around São
Paulo’s streets might be challenging and stressful, once traffic jams are frequent and chaotic. A radio station
dedicated to informing drivers about traffic status, 24h per day, was launched in 2007 and local news daily
talk about the jams. Traffic also causes economy inefficiency and many negative externalities on public
health, environment, traffic flow, etc.
        The decennial Origin-Destination Survey of 2007 – a 30 thousand families’ household survey on
commuting realized by the São Paulo Metropolitan Company (Metro), the state-owned company that runs
city’s subway system -, shows that MRSP resident’s daily number of trips is around 38 million (METRO,
2008). The figure is 21% higher than 1997 (METRO, 1999), while the population grew by 16% during
those years. This increase did not necessarily impose pressure over traffic volume and it is probably a gain
for people’s mobility: they are moving around town more frequently. Traffic chaos might be best explained
if one notice that 42% of these trips are made by people on cars. In 2015, MRSP’s vehicles fleet was around
12 million - SP accounts for 7.5 million of them, of which 70% are cars. If all of them go out on the street
- SP has 17,000 kilometres of paved streets - at the same time, it would very likely cause an instant gridlock.
        Abstractions aside, São Paulo accounts for approximately 25 million, or 65%, of MRSP daily trips.
Of these, 31.6% are made using individual modes and 31.3% use some kind of active mobility. The other
37.1% rely on public collective modes, as Figure 1 shows. The total number of trips in São Paulo grew by
18.9% during the 1997-2007 period. Figure 2, that contains information on the principal mode taken, also
shows that the main modes - walking, driving and riding bus - grew up in absolute terms. However, only
the latter grew up as a proportion of all trips, from 24.05% to 24.22%.

        Both commuting pattern and mode share are also markedly different when considering commuters’
income level. Figure 3 follows the same logic as Figure 1, but commuters are divided in deciles of familiar
income. Two aspects are instantly noticed when looking at this graph: first, the number of daily trips grows
up as income increases. The 20% richer commute two times more than the 20% poorer. Second, the mode
share is entirely different between income levels. While the poorest commuters rely on walking and transit,
more than half of the richest’s trips are made by car. This simple analysis denotes the importance of transit
not only for transportation system itself, but also because sometimes it is the only way poor people can
move around town. That is to say: transit is remarkably important for São Paulo’s mobility, and even more
important for poor people’s mobility.

       São Paulo’s transportation system as a whole raises issues that reach many areas of concern. At the
individual level, one person who commutes face many important decisions that can cost her time - Which
                                                     3
mode is faster? What time to leave? Which route to take? - and money: the average familiar income share
that goes toward paying urban public transportation in Brazil is around 15% (Carvalho & Pereira, 2012).
Mobility is also a government’s concern, and keeping transit fare affordable - perhaps by subsidizing it -
means guaranteeing people’s mobility. On the other hand, governments obviously face budget constraints.
Between 2013 and 2017, São Paulo’s budget in real terms remained stagnated, while bus subsidies grew by
61%, reaching approximately 0.818 billion USD. This grant covers only 32% of bus system’s cost and
represents almost 7% of city’s budget. This allocation problem reached the public debate during the past
years.
       Thus, one substantial problem in the intersection of transport economics and public policy is how
to provide or regulate transit having in mind that “urban transport can contribute to poverty reduction
both indirectly through its impact on the city economy and hence on economic growth, and directly
through its impact on the daily needs of poor people” (Gwilliam, 2002, p. xii). This is a new paradigm
in urban transport strategy that essentially comprise keeping fare affordable and the system itself efficient.
The future work approaches an important information on the topic, regarding this paradigm: price-elasticity
of demand.
        Understanding the effects of price change over ridership is important for both practice and theory
in many aspects. For instance, planning transit supply, approaching its financial aspects, considering whose
familiar budget will be affected or who will face mobility deprivations in an eventual fare rise, providing
clues on whether subsidies are cost-efficient, among other. Furthermore, it might also help to strengthen
public transit as a whole, which is a crucial factor in cities sustainability.
        Thus, the present work aims to close this gap and contribute to the debate by calculating São Paulo’s
price elasticity of bus demand, for both short (each cross section, 1997 and 2007) and long (ten years period)
term. In order to do so, the work relies on estimating two Discrete Choice Models, as proposed by Daniel
McFadden (1973, 1974), using OD Surveys’ data of 1997 and 2007 and some simulation. Discrete Choice
Models consider that each individual can decide on his or her commuting mode in a choice set - where price
and duration associated with each mode is known by him or her - and does so in a semi-rational way; thus,
one part of her utility function is considered random. The model is estimated with a multinomial logit
regression - the coefficients are changes on probabilities of one choosing each mode, if some independent
variable changes and everything else remain constant - from which aggregate probabilities of each mode
being chosen can be derivate, as well marginal effects of independent variables on these probabilities. The
latter provide short term elasticities. The first is the aggregate demand (Hensher & Bullock, 1979) that, if
estimated for 1997 and 2007, can be compared in order to calculate long term elasticity; however, an
exogenous price shock is required for that. Hence, the innovation proposed in this paper is to use Bilhete
Único (BU) as source of an exogenous price shock.
        Bilhete Único, implemented in 2004 by São Paulo’s city government, is a transit ticketing smart
card. The fare pattern allows users to pay for the first ride and make up to three bus transfers within three
hours not paying for any transfer. Commuters can also use it to pay 23% less (in comparison to paying for
both modes) when taking the metro or train before or after taking up to three buses. OD Surveys make clear
that users have changed their behaviour: in 2007, around 24% of bus users made one or more transfers,
against 15% in 1997. BU is also a public policy that notably makes transit fares cheaper for people who
spend more time (and distance) commuting, once users pay progressively less for its use and those happen
to be the poorest in the city.
       One limitation of the proposed approach is that the long-term elasticity can only be calculated for
the commuting form that uses more than one bus. Nonetheless, it is useful in the terms said above -
especially once one considers that the affected users are workers who live on São Paulo’s outskirts and
commute for two or more hours to São Paulo’s downtown every day.
       This work is organized in five sections including this introduction. In the following section we
position the paper in the literature, which will go over transport economics, to qualify the hypothesis and

research questions. After that, the methodological section presents the econometric strategy to answer the
questions of interest discussed above. The results are presented in the homonym section and discussed
thereafter considering the consequences for public policy. The conclusion is the last section and sums up
the paper.
TRANSPORT ECONOMICS AND THE RELEVANCE OF PRICE ELASTICIY IN
TRANSPORT PLANNING
Although transport economists usually focus on price and demand, there are many other important factors
affected by transport related issues - and influencing them. Brueckner (2011), for example, converge upon
transport many aspects of urban economics’ analysis, as firm location and spatial concentration of jobs.
The latter is explained by two major forces: scale economies and agglomeration economies. The first
regards the fact that specialization leads to more productivity and economic gains. The second is about the
gains that happen when firms locate one next to another, due to easiness on hiring workers, competition
and/or cooperation between firms, knowledge spillovers, among others.
         Transportation costs savings are one type of agglomeration economy in that final product shipping
cost is (very likely) reduced when a firm locates in a city - closer to its final market, workers and, perhaps,
to its inputs supplier. Those forces not only explain cities formation, but they also explain why many cities
are monocentric (a town in which employment is concentrated close to the city centre) because firms tend
to concentrate where others are already located (Brueckner, 2011; Quinet & Vickerman, 2004). Brueckner
(2011) argues that transport plays a central role in cities formation itself, what is empirically discussed by
Glaeser (2011) emphatically. Urban transportation is then key for people’s location on cities and, in a big
town, one is very likely to spend a big amount of time commuting, every day. Transportation costs are one
of the most important forces on cities dynamics: it influences firm location, cities formation and subsequent
size, residents location and land and dwellings prices (Brueckner, 2011; Quinet & Vickerman, 2004).
        Those factors make transport as a natural subfield of economics, as mentioned by McFadden (2011)
in the foreword of A Handbook of Transport Economics, edited by De Palma, Lindsey, Quinet and
Vickerman (2011). His opinion is that there is a specific subfield of “economics of transport” in the sense
that the problems addressed by it - namely: supply, demand and regulation (Quinet & Vickerman, 2004) -
are fundamentally of economics. But why should it be so special? Could not it just be a subfield of
microeconomics? The authors agree that transportation is a very specific sector which “deserves its only
economics subfield” because it has some very specific characteristics that make necessary adjustments on
models. The most remarkable specific features are the role of space, time and the multiplicity of agents’
decisions (McFadden, 2011).
        Regarding space, he shares what was said about urban factors before in this work. Activities are
located in space and the gaps between them affect costs and, therefore, influence land cost and generates
spatial inequalities. Time is seen as an attribute of all consumption, but is even more important for transport,
once it is required for mobility itself. The role of transport in individual’s decision process unfold in two
parts: choices regarding mobility consumption itself and those that are part of a much wider set of decisions,
once transportation is necessary for (or consequence of) other activities. That is, one has to choose where
she is going to live, for instance. Her home location is, therefore, influenced by commuting costs to her
workplace. This long-run decision unfolds itself in many short-run, daily choices: to use car or transit, what
time to leave, whether to park on the street or to pay for a spot in a private parking lot, etc.
       Lately, great attention has been given to urban transport, particularly public collective transport,
once developing country cities’ sustainability depends on less congestion - mainly caused by cars - and
more efficient and intensive uses of the existent infrastructure (Brinco, 2006). Thus, this is a relevant
subfield in many disciplines, and the exhaustiveness of research is accompanied by methodological
sophistication that have led to very robust results and theoretical progress.
        Regarding pricing form, Bird (2001) defends user charges - a direct price for a service or good which
is paid by the identified user of it - whenever possible, because they should maximize efficiency and welfare
                                                       5
of a scarce resource. The author says that “the main economic rationale of user charges is thus not to
produce revenue, but to promote economic efficiency” (p. 172), in that people will over consume a scarce
resource - what is a problem because of the very simple reason that resources are scarce, particularly in
developing countries - if it is funded by general taxes. Over-consumption would happen because consumers
choose to consume a good until its marginal cost equals marginal benefits of consumption. If citizens are
not directly charged when pursuing a good or service (i.e. they do not perceive the cost they pay for a good
once it is financed by general taxes), the cost of consuming an additional unit is virtually zero. Over-
consumption is then tightly associated with under (or subsidized by non users) pricing.
        User charges appears to be literature’s preferred form of urban services financing. Bahl and Linn
dedicate a chapter of their seminal book Urban Public Finance in Developing Countries (1992) to discuss
issues that exist on public services pricing. They highlight four main concerns associated with that:
efficiency, fiscal constraints, equity and growth and political and administrative feasibility. All of them
must be considered together and their principles can be applied to any kind of public service.
         Efficiency on pricing urban public services is fundamentally maximizing welfare and, as mentioned
before, this is achieved when the price is set equal to the marginal cost of its production. Bird (2001) points
that efficient public services or goods user charges (prices) should be exactly its marginal economic cost.
This would also enable the achievement of a socially desirable level of prices. “The justification of this rule
is that welfare is maximized when the benefit of an additional unit of the service to the consumer - which
is reflected by his willingness to pay the price - is equal to the cost of producing this additional unit.” (Bahl
& Linn, 1992, p. 241).
        Marginal cost pricing rule allocates resources efficiently because it achieves the output level that
produces the highest net utility for the Economy (Bahl & Linn, 1992; Bird, 2001). Although it is clearly the
scheme of taxation recommended by literature, it requires a few assumptions which are hard to find in
practice: perfect information, absence of externalities, distortions in the economy, transactions costs and
zero economic surplus. Besides these, there is another assumption that the present work might help to relax
(or not) in practice: demand cannot be perfectly price-inelastic: it should respond to price changes. Even
though those aspects impose several limits to the rule’s application, Bahl and Linn argue that it still provide
relevant implications, such as drawing government attention to economic costs (and not to sunken or
“historical” costs) and to the necessity of price readjustment during inflationary periods.
       There is no evidence on how bus fare is priced in São Paulo, but the financial deficit generated by
the system is heavily subsidized by general taxes. General fund financing might be acceptable if the
following conditions are met: a deficit still exists after marginal cost pricing, general funds can be collected
with no distortion to resource allocation and if the financial deficit does not affect investment and
management decisions. There is also an equity concern: is it fair and/or social desirable to fund someone’s
consumption in a crucial service?
        Nevertheless, distortion-free levies are virtually non-existent and thus the question becomes whether
general fund financing - that is, subsidies - causes a smaller distortion than users charges higher than the
marginal (or full) cost of service provision. The latter might be advantageous to bear governments in mind
of a service affordability when they are designing it - that is, governments should never design services
which the population cannot afford. Developing, resources constrained, governments always face a trade-
off between service quality and coverage. These arguments add to Bird (2001) opinion that positive
externalities caused by the provision of a service can justify government subsidies.
        Congestion causes many externalities - air pollution, noise, accidents, urban barriers, landscape
effects, energetic inefficiency (Friedrich & Quinet, 2011) and even plunges on workers productivity
(Haddad & Vieira, 2015). If there is good evidence that public transit mitigates those negative externalities,
it might make sense to subsidize this service. However, in 2016, São Paulo’s government spent around
BRL 2.7 billion (approximately USD 0.818 billion) in subsidizing the bus system, which costs around BRL
8.2 billion (or USD 2.485 billion). Spent estimate for 2017 is around BRL 3.4 billion. Subsidies have been

                                                       6
growing through the years while city’s budget is stagnated in real terms. Those figures are even more
impressive once reappraising that most cities in Brazil do not even subsidize transit and brings up again the
question on whether transit should or not be subsidized.
        Pricing the fare adequately means not only to promote efficiency, but also to keep transit affordable
- what is of extreme importance. Carruthers, Dick and Saurkar (2005) refers to affordability of public transit
as whether “the financial cost of journeys put an individual or household in the position of having to make
sacrifices to travel or the extent to which they can afford to travel when they want to” (Carruthers et al.,
2005, p. 1). Affordability might be seen as a degree of transit accessibility and is important in developing
countries as Brazil, where poor’s mobility depend on it (Carruthers et al., 2005; Carvalho & Pereira, 2011;
Gwilliam, 2002).
        Carvalho and Pereira (2011) also point out that bus system’s costs and fare prices have increased all
over Brazil during the last decades, while ridership has decreased during the 1990’s. This dynamic makes
transit more and more expensive because there are less people paying for the system as a whole (since
service level takes time to adjust to ridership demand). Another problem pointed by Brinco (2006) is that
Brazilian transportation policy is highly car-oriented: there is a development paradigm centred on cars,
which has deleterious effects over public collective transportation.
        Hence, the picture that literature makes of public transportation system in Brazil is that of
municipalities and concessionaires providing a poor service while central government agenda does not
accommodate policies that could favour it. Transit cost is high and has soared lately, imposing pressure
over people’s (and a few municipalities’) budget, specially over those who are poor, live on the outskirts
of metropolitan areas and whose mobility depends on public transit. Looking closer to public policies’ state
of practice, they struggle to follow academic recommendations. Public policies of transport find themselves
in the middle of complicated theoretical models and a “world which does not comply with its requirements
for optimality” (Quinet & Vickerman, 2004, p. 341). Public collective transportation is a subfield affected
by the same, but even more critical, adversity. This is notably true in developing countries where - although
academics’ recommendations are less developed - state’s built capacities are even worse (Bräutigam, 2008;
Fjeldstad & Moore, 2007; Keen, 2012). Thus, a huge imbalance between the state of the art and practice
exists.
        Besides cities sustainability - and especially if we shift our analysis to Brazil - another feature of
public urban transportation worth attention: transit is how poor people’s mobility might be guaranteed
(Gomide, 2003, Carvalho & Pereira (2011)). Public transit then becomes even more important if one
considers its capacity of poverty alleviation and social development (Gomide, 2003). But this might only
happen if it is priced properly (Estupiñán, Gómez Lobo, Muñoz Raskin, & Serebrisky, 2007). To price fare
adequately also means to strengthen transport system itself (Carvalho & Pereira, 2011) because of
efficiency reasons.
        If one considers that investment on public transit has positive externalities through congestion
mitigation (McFadden, 2011; Quinet & Vickerman, 2004) it can also have positive impact over economy
and productivity (Gwilliam, 2002, Haddad & Vieira (2015)) and poverty-reduction (Gwilliam, 2002). In
brief, valuing public transit is valuing urban development and sustainability. It is then possible that transit
generates enough positive externalities for society in that subsidies might be justifiable.
        On the other hand, there is a debate in the literature about how efficient are subsidies in urban
transportation on getting the poorest better. Estupiñán et al. (2007) suggest that supply-side subsidies are
neutral or regressive, while demand-size subsidies might be more efficient.
        The two major recommendations made by literature thus are to keep transit affordable and make it
as efficient as possible - possibly through proper user charges and pricing. Thus, keeping transit fare
affordable means guaranteeing people’s mobility and boosting development. On the other hand,
governments obviously face budget constraints and subsidize one policy that can be priced on marginal
cost does not bring maximum efficiency. Thus, once transit strengthen might consolidate urban
                                                      7
development and sustainability and mitigate congestion externalities, a key factor to be known in any
transit system is price elasticity of demand, because (a) it helps on pricing the fare on the demand
level that causes the greatest welfare and (b) it helps to mitigate effects on demand shifts caused by
fare variation that can jeopardize people’s mobility.
        For all passenger transport (not only just public collective), price elasticity is usually small or
inelastic in the short-term and larger in the long-term (Quinet & Vickerman, 2004). Quinet and Vickerman
(2004) review a series of studies and present that urban public transport’s elasticities are, at average, -0.3,
varying from -0.1 to -0.6, in the sort-term. In the long-term, they are usually about double these values.
        Wang and Skinner (1984) calculate this values for seven American cities and achieved values
ranging from -0.042 to -0.62. They use a time-series model, considering monthly ridership as the demand
and controlling for many variables, real price being one of them. The literature reviewed by them find
values from -0.04 to -0.87 through various methods. Hensher and Bullock (1979) calculate price elasticity
of Sidney’s, Australia, rail services. The value found was -0.57. In Brazilian literature, only a few studies
that seek those numbers are found. Carvalho and Pereira (2011) get price elasticities for 10 cities together.
At average, the number they get is around -0.6.
        Thus, work’s research question is “what are long and short-term price elasticities of bus demand
in São Paulo?”, given city’s and system’s importance. This is useful to enrich academical debate - and
might also provide transit planners and technicians good information to act - on bus subsidies and fare
pricing.
       Research question also entail another two questions brought by the literature review:
           1. Since one of subsidies’ justification is transit positive externalities, larger subsidy for bus
              system would make commuters shift from car to bus, mitigating congestion and improving
              city’s mobility? and
           2. How does it differ between poor and rich people and what does it means for user charges?
       The hypothesis raised during the literature review are the following:
           1. Price elasticity of bus trips demand in São Paulo is negative and smaller than one, that is,
              inelastic, in the short-term.
           2. Price elasticity of bus trips (with one or more transfers) demand in São Paulo is negative and
              greater than the short-term one, that is - less inelastic - in the long-term.
        It is worth mention that the approach for verifying the second hypothesis is, somehow, innovative,
once it identifies Bilhete Único implementation as an exogenous price shock in trips that use more than one
bus - that is why long-term elasticity is only calculated for this kind of trip. In 2004, São Paulo’s city
government changed the system of payment for buses and implemented a public policy called Bilhete Único
(BU), a smart card that allows users to pay for the first ride and make up to three bus transfers - that is,
taking up to four buses - within three hours. Imagine an individual that takes two buses to work. In 2004,
this individual happened to spend half of she used to spend on transit - literally - overnight.


       EMPIRICAL METHODS
To answer the question and verify the hypothesis, we propose to make use of Daniel McFadden’s Discrete
Choice Model (1973, 1974), an approach which is traditionally used in transport economics field - and in
others, also. McFadden’s work is considered to has “fundamentally changed the way empirical economists
study individual behavior” (Manski, 2001, p. 224). His 1973 article’s “most striking characteristic (…) is
its smooth progression from a conceptual contribution of great generality to a practical contribution of
immediate usefulness” (Manski, 2001, p. 224), what also make the model interesting here.


                                                      8
        The model is as follows: consider that an individual 𝑖 chooses her commuting mode, called here 𝑚
(which belongs to her choice set2, 𝑀). Consider also that she does so maximizing her utility 𝑈 (the well-
being achieved when consuming the good (Nicholson & Snyder, 2005; Quinet & Vickerman, 2004)), which
is subject to budget constraints:
                                                     𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑈𝑖𝑚 , 𝑝𝑚 𝑥𝑚 ≤ 𝑅,                                               (1)
where 𝑝𝑚 and 𝑥𝑚 are the price and quantity consumed of mode 𝑚 and 𝑅 is the budget to be spent on
commuting.
        On the semi-rational model proposed by McFadden (1973), the utility function is not fully
observable or quantifiable by the researcher; nevertheless, it can be modelled in the following way: first,
divide 𝑈 in two terms - one that is observed and one that is not. The first, 𝑉𝑖𝑚 , is usually called
representative utility or systematic component (Train, 2009). The latter, 𝜀𝑖𝑚 , is the unobserved part and it
is considered random or stochastic. According to McFadden (1973, p. 108), the first term “reflects the
‘representative’ tastes of the population” and the second, “the idiosyncrasies of this individual in tastes for
the alternative”. Then, 𝑈 is defined as:
                                                   𝑈𝑖𝑚 = 𝑉𝑖𝑚 + 𝜀𝑖𝑚 ,                                                   (2)
where 𝑉𝑖𝑚 is the indirect utility, that incorporate budgetary constraints and price. Given the choice set 𝑀,
the decision maker will choose the mode 𝑚 that maximizes her utility. Let’s say that 𝑏 and 𝑐 are possible
choices and 𝑃𝑏 = 𝑃𝑐, one might choose the latter when 𝑈𝑏 > 𝑈𝑐.
         As the researcher do not observe 𝜀𝑖𝑚 , “choices can only be modelled in terms of probabilities”
(Croissant, 2012, p. 11). Then, considering 𝜀𝑖𝑚 stochastic, the joint density of vector 𝜀𝑖 = ⟨𝜀𝑖1 , . . . , 𝜀𝑖𝑚 ⟩ is
𝑓(𝜀𝑖 ), that allows for making probabilistic statements about an individual’s choice (Train, 2009). In other
words, from decision maker’s point of view, the choice is purely deterministic; however, from the
researcher’s point of view, there is an unobserved part that composes utility and, then, it can only be
formulated in probabilistic terms (Croissant, 2012). In a similar way as proposed by McFadden (1973),
probability 𝑃𝑖𝑏 that 𝑖 chooses 𝑏 over other modes 𝑚 in the choice set 𝑀 is then:
                                      𝑃𝑖𝑏    ≡ 𝑃(𝑏|𝑖, 𝑀)
                                             = 𝑃(𝑈𝑏 > 𝑈𝑚 ), ∀𝑚 ≠ 𝑏
                                             = 𝑃(𝑉𝑖𝑏 + 𝜀𝑖𝑏 > 𝑉𝑖𝑚 + 𝜀𝑖𝑚 ), ∀ 𝑚 ≠ 𝑏                                      (3)
                                             = 𝑃(𝜀𝑖𝑚 − 𝜀𝑖𝑏 > 𝑉𝑖𝑏 − 𝑉𝑖𝑚 ), ∀ 𝑚 ≠ 𝑏
                                             = ∫𝜀𝐼 (𝜀𝑖𝑚 − 𝜀𝑖𝑏 > 𝑉𝑖𝑏 − 𝑉𝑖𝑚 )𝑓(𝜀𝑖 )𝑑𝜀𝑖 , ∀ 𝑚 ≠ 𝑏,

where 𝐼(⋅) is an indicator function which is equal to 1 if the expression is true and 0 if is not (Train, 2009).
Considering all 𝑚 modes available at the choice set, the probability of 𝑏 is chosen (i.e., a general form that
relates all the choice set of equation (3)) is, therefore:
        𝑃𝑖𝑏    = 𝑃𝑟(𝑈𝑏 > 𝑈1 , . . . , 𝑈𝑏 > 𝑈𝑐 , . . . , 𝑈𝑏 > 𝑈𝑚 ), ∀ 𝑚 ≠ 𝑐)
                                                                                                                      (4)
               = 𝑃𝑟(𝜀𝑖1 − 𝜀𝑖𝑏 > 𝑉𝑖𝑏 − 𝑉𝑖1 , . . . , 𝜀𝑖𝑐 − 𝜀𝑖𝑏 > 𝑉𝑖𝑏 − 𝑉𝑖𝑐 , . . . , 𝜀𝑖𝑚 − 𝜀𝑖𝑏 > 𝑉𝑖𝑏 − 𝑉𝑖𝑚 ), ∀ 𝑚 ≠ 𝑐)
        Being 𝐹−𝑏 the multivariate distribution of all but 𝑏’s error terms, the unconditional probability can
also be written in the following terms:

                                      𝑃𝑏 = ∫ 𝐹−𝑏 [(𝑉𝑏 − 𝑉1 ) + 𝜀𝑏 , . . . , (𝑉𝑏 − 𝑉𝑚 ) + 𝜀𝑏 ]𝑓(𝜀𝑏 )𝑑𝜀𝑏                 (5)
       McFadden (1974) then shows that, if 3 assumptions holds, probabilities’ closed forms can be
estimated through a multinomial logit. They are organized by Croissant (2012) in a simpler way, that are
shown on the Appendix. It is demonstrable, then, that a logistic transformation of the deterministic utility,

       The unconditional probability of 𝑏 being chosen is, hence:

       and can be estimated by maximum likelihood with a multinomial logit regression.
       Once the model is estimated, the marginal effects with respect to individual-specific variables is:

                                      𝜕𝑧𝑖

       and the marginal effects with respect to mode-specific variables is:
                                         𝜕𝑃𝑖𝑚
                                                 = 𝛾𝑃𝑖𝑚 (1 − 𝑃𝑖𝑏 ),                                     (10)

        Applying (10) with respect to price, in this context where there is one model for each OD Survey
year, gives exactly the short-term price elasticity of demand.
      We can also justify that a weighted sum of each individual’s 𝑃𝑖𝑚 equals the demand 𝑄𝑖𝑚 of trips by
the modal 𝑚 (in terms of all trips), as made by Hensher and Bullock (1979), Train (2009):

                                            𝑄ˆ𝑚 = ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑚 ,                                           (11)
Which supply the demand on the equation below, which provides the long-term price elasticity of
demand:
                                                     𝛥𝑄

       However, in practical situations, it is not possible, for example, to know if an eventual variation of
𝑄 was really due to 𝛥𝑃 or caused by any other factor (Wang & Skinner, 1984). Then, we propose applying
1997’s model’s coefficients over 2007’s model’s data, which works as a prediction of 2007’s demand if the
environmental characteristics of 1997’s would not have changed.

RESULTS
     𝑉𝑖𝑚 can be described in terms of:
         •   Individual specific variables 𝑧𝑖 with an alternative specific coefficient 𝛾𝑚 ,
         •   Alternative specific variables 𝑡𝑖𝑚 with an alternative specific coefficient, 𝛿𝑚 and
         •   Alternative specific variables 𝑥𝑖𝑚 with a generic coefficient 𝛽,
       The second and third set of variables differ on whether their coefficients are different for each mode.
This allows for valuating one attribute differently for different modes. The representative utility is
generically specified as:
                                    𝑉𝑖𝑚 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑥𝑖𝑚 + 𝛾𝑚 𝑧𝑖 + 𝛿𝑚 𝑡𝑖𝑚 , ∀𝑚                                (13)
       Thus, the present work estimates models using OD data with the following specifications: first, one
with cost and time associated with generic coefficients (one minute spent on whatever mode causes the
same disutility for the individual):
                                    𝑉𝑖𝑚 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽1 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 + 𝛽2 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑚 + 𝛄𝐦 𝐙𝐢 , ∀𝑚                        (14)
and then, treating time’s coefficient as mode specific (allowing time spent on one mode to causes different
disutility than time spent on other modes):
                                    𝑉𝑖𝑚 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽1 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 + 𝛄𝐦 𝐙𝐢 + 𝛿𝑚 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑚 , ∀𝑚                        (15)
       𝐙𝐢 is a set of demographic variables concerning individuals, and 𝛄𝐦 stands for the coefficients
associated with each variable, for each mode.
        The variables are found on (or are possible to simulate based on) the Metro’s OD surveys. The
surveys also inform which mode was used on the trip. As mentioned before, Metro’s OD surveys ask each
resident of a sample of households about their trips on the previous day of the interview. Therefore, it
collects information about the respondent (as age, gender, income, educational level, occupation, etc.) and
                                                      11
the trip (duration, starting and ending point, motivation, hours, etc.). This means that the ODs do not present
all the mode options (and option’s features, as price and time it would take) that are available to this person
before she makes her decision about the mode to be used on a trip. For example, if someone has made a
trip using a bicycle, we know how long did this trip take, but we do not know how long it would take if this
individual has chosen to go by bus. Thereby, a few assumptions and simulations are required. First, we
assume that all modes are available to be chosen by every individual for every trip reported on the OD
survey. Second - once the model also requires information on price and time of all mode options available
for the trip - we simulate trip’s price and time in non-taken modes. We also have to simulate trip’s price if
it was made by a mode which has not a fixed price (namely, car; bus fare, for example, is fixed, thus we
know exactly how much did a trip by bus cost). Simulation’s description can be find in the Appendix.
        Thus, these steps provide a sample of trips in São Paulo collected by the ODs surveys. For each trip,
we have individual’s demographic characteristics (observed), a set of alternatives modes and its respective
price and time (either observed or simulated), and the mode chosen by the individual (observed). This last
feature classifies the approach here proposed as a revealed preferences model. It works as if one person -
the decision maker whose age, income, gender, etc. are observed - has the option to choose between a set
of modes to make a trip. This person also knows how long a trip would take and how much it would cost
in every mode, and chooses one of them - revealed through the survey.
       It is worth also describing some other features of data. Walking is only considered as one mode if
the person walked to work or school (any level) or, for other trip purposes, if distance was greater than
500m. Also, the ODs surveys register up to four modes taken in a (multimodal) trip. For example, if one
took the subway and one bus, both modes will be registered3. This entails another problem: which mode to
consider on multimodal trips? We chose not to use the “main mode” hierarchy defined by the Metro
Company4. Instead, we’ve tested many grouping combinations. Once almost all combinations suited well
the model, we opt for the one which makes further analysis easier to interpret. Modes are reported on Table
1, below, whose average cost, cost per kilometre, distance and speed, for each mode observed in OD
Surveys data – which do not consider the simulations - are shown in Table 2.




3
  Walking, however, does not figure as one mode on multimodal trips. It is also, an only, a unique mode taken. For example, if
one walked from home to the bus stop, took a bust, an then walked again from the bus stop to work. It is registered on the data
that this person walked for 𝑥 minutes on the origin and 𝑦 minutes on the destination, but on the (up to four) modes fields, only
bus is registered.

  Described on the Introduction section. This hierarchy makes sense for transport planning and does not fit future work’s
methodology and objectives.
                                                              12
        Regressions results of Models denoted on equations (14) and (15), for 1997 and 2007, are
presented on Tables (5) and (6), on the Appendix. Their coefficients are not interpretable straightforward.
Intercepts are omitted. Before any odds-ratio transformation, some interpretation might be useful: for cost
and (generic) duration, coefficients’ signs are negative for every model, for both years. The meaning of
such signs is that the probability of choosing any mode decreases if price or duration increases as expected.
As car is the base mode, when duration have mode-specific coefficients, they are interpreted in relation to
car. The pattern is the same for both years: if duration of all modes but walking increases, holding
everything else constant, the probability that the respective mode is chosen to the detriment of car increases.
Following the same logic, if familiar income and age increases, there is less chance to each of the listed
modes being chosen in comparison to car. The same is observed for being male or student. Again, in
comparison to car, to have a job increases the probability of one to choose rapid transit and its combination
with bus, but decreases the probability of choosing bus only or walking - this might be due to low
accessibility of rapid transit in São Paulo. The work with those logit coefficients that is worth doing here is
getting their marginal effects, in order to answer to research’s questions.
     The sixth models presented in each table for both years, presented the best fit, then, will be the only
one used in the next subsections. Test statistics as Hausman-McFadden (Independence of Irrelevant
Alternatives), likelihood-ratio test shows that the model is robust.
    Applying Equation 10 to every mode - using the average value of each modes price - provides Tables
5 and 6. Their interpretation is: “how much does the probability of one individual, picked at random,
choosing the column mode changes given a 1% change at line mode price’s average”.
The figures of interest are on the diagonals. It is possible to notice that price elasticity of one bus demand
in São Paulo is -0.012 for 1997 and -0.05 for 2007. For two (or more, up to four) bus, it is -0.075 for
1997 and -0.089 for 2007. Another useful information is given by the cross price elasticities of demand.
They tell us that if bus fare decreases, there will not be so much people shifting from other modes to bus.




       Applying Equation 11 to one model provides one mode’s aggregate probability of choice, for one
year. Results are reported in Tables 7 and 8 for 1997 and 2007.

       To control for spurious effects on demand caused by other variables, before inserting these values
on Equation 12, we propose to apply Model’s (6), 1997, coefficients on the 2007 dataset, and, then,
calculating the aggregate probabilities of each mode again. This is equivalent to predict the demand for
2007, using individual’s comportment of 1997. These results are reported in Table 9.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
       The present work briefly discussed transport economics and public finance theory and previous
works about fare pricing, including one important aspect of analysis: price elasticity of transit demand.
       Using a discrete choice econometric framework and data from the OD Surveys of 1997 and
2007, it has estimated short term price elasticity of bus demand in the city of São Paulo at -0.012 for
1997 and-0.05 for 2007. For two (or more, up to four) buses, the figures are -0.075 for 1997 and -0.089
for 2007, and -0.073 in the ten-year period, that is, the long-term.
         First, it is worth to comment that figures follow what have been found in literature. The pattern for
São Paulo is the same of developed cities and other major Brazilian metropolitan regions: demand for bus
is price inelastic. That is, demand is not very much responsive to price fluctuation. According to the value
achieved, in the long term, if fare for two or more buses increases by 1%, demand is expected to decrease
by 0.073%. It is plausible to extend these results to bus demand as well, given the short-term elasticities
results.
        Real fare prices remained stagnated around BRL 3.80, in real terms, since 2005. However, as the
literature points out, costs are rising. Thus, São Paulo’s subsidies for bus have increased by 61% during the
last four years - after violent demonstrations in 2013 and an election pledge in 2016. This might be good
by one side: state is maintaining fare price at the same level, what might bring easiness on familiar budget
planning. However, at what cost? Is this policy imposing pressure over city’s budget? Is the fare really
affordable and progressive? Does it put system operation at risk? Service levels and quality have also been
maintained? In the 21st Century, with a whole new amount of technology at people’s hands, does this huge
market intervention make sense? Those questions might be answered for the final work.

 Price value for 2007 is one fare price, BRL 2.30, because any commuter taking two or more bus in 2007 payed for just one.
For 1997, it is the average cost of those trips, BRL 3.50 , in 2007’s real terms.

       The shallowest meaning of the elasticities calculated is that the government can increase fare, and
people would still use transit. From governments perspective - if one considers that governments have the
incentive to maximize revenue -, to do so is tempting, but might not be adequate: as we have argued, the
most needed people’s mobility rely on public transit. There is also the other side of the coin: reducing fare
price will not make much commuters shifting from private transport to transit. Hence, this seems not to be
an adequate policy for taking cars off the street, or encouraging people to use transit - a must for more
sustainable cities.
        The picture for São Paulo seems to be the following: state is maintaining fare price at a high cost,
but this is not necessarily making city’s mobility better. Many people are still using car and another huge
amount rely on a system that might collapse due to increasing costs, once subsidies are finite; the other
option would be to rise the fare, what would put people’s mobility at risk. The cross elasticities estimated
also suggest that reducing bus prices will not make commuters leaving their car at home. Another kind of
policy - as taxes that make drivers internalize the externalities generated by their cars, or nudge instruments
- might be more effective.
        The models were estimated with no division on data. That is, behavior was implicitly assumed to
be homogeneous for all trip purposes, familiar income, age, etc. One possible interesting further analysis is
to estimate models for each of those groups, what would overcome heterogeneity between groups. For
policy, this might be interesting because we would know how each group reacts when fare price varies.
Poor people’s ridership plunge because they can not afford it anymore? Or their behavior is more inelastic
once they might have no other option? There are many future advances that can be made.

1. MODEL’S ASSUMPTIONS
H1: Independence of errors, that states an univariate distribution of the errors terms. They allow the
calculation of only a one-dimensional integral to compute probabilities, later.

                                     (𝑃𝑏 |𝜀𝑏 ) = ∏ 𝐹𝑚 (𝑉𝑏 − 𝑉𝑚 + 𝜀𝑏 )

                                           𝑚≠𝑏

H2: Gumbel distribution, which says that all 𝜀 follow a standard Gumbel distribution, where 𝐹 is the
cumulative and 𝑓 is the density functions:
                                                               −𝑥

                                              𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑒 −(𝑥+𝑒
H3: Homoscedasticity, which says that errors are identically distributed.
The three put together, the conditional and unconditional probabilities shown in equations become the ones
below, where 𝐹 is the cumulative and 𝑓 is the density functions of the standard Gumbel Distribution.
