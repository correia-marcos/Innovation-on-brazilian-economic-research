Resumo: A produção agrícola no Brasil aumentou nas últimas décadas. Apesar desse aumento, a
população rural continua a enfrentar desigualdade de renda. O acesso ao mercado, visando a
comercialização da produção, pode minimizar esta desigualdade. Neste artigo, estimou-se a influência
do cooperativismo, como instrumento de acesso ao mercado, na geração e distribuição de renda nas
áreas rurais do Brasil. Para determinar a influência do cooperativismo na renda familiar, utilizou-se
uma técnica de decomposição de renda e dados da Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios -
PNAD. Os resultados indicam que, mais do que elevar a renda, o cooperativismo possui potencial para
minimizar a desigualdade de sua distribuição. Também se verificou que maiores níveis de educação,
crédito e acesso à extensão rural potencializaram o efeito de comercializar com cooperativas sobre a
renda. Sugere-se que políticas públicas integrando cooperativismo, crédito rural, extensão rural e
promoção do capital humano seriam mais efetivas, devido à sinergia desses elementos.

Abstract: Agricultural production in Brazil has increased in recent decades. Despite this increase, the
rural population continues to face income inequality. Market access aimed at the commercialization
of production can minimize this issue, thereby improving income. In this article, we estimate the
influence of cooperativism—as a method of market access—in income generation and distribution in
rural areas of Brazil. To determine the influence of cooperativism on household income, we use an
income decomposition and the household survey “National Household Sample Survey – PNAD”. The
results indicate that, rather than raising income, cooperativism has the potential to minimize the
inequality of income distribution. It was also determined that higher levels of education, credit and
access to rural extension increased the effect of marketing with cooperatives on income. The findings
of the present study suggest that public policies integrating cooperativism, rural credit, rural
extension, and human capital promotion would be more effective due to the synergy of these elements.

1 Introduction

         In recent decades, Brazil has increased agricultural production and has experienced stronger
participation in the global food market. Despite increased production, rural populations continue to
cope with high income inequality. Commercial agricultural production remains concentrated in large
farms, with approximately 85% of gross farm income being generated by 11.4% of Brazilian farms
(Alves et al., 2013). Barros et al. (2006) and Helfand et al. (2009) found evidence of high income
inequality in rural areas of Brazil. Although income inequality has declined over time, much remains
to be addressed to achieve the desired scenario of no income inequality in rural Brazil.
         Several factors can contribute to more equitable income distribution in rural areas, including
access to markets, rural extension, and financial services. According to data from the Brazilian Institute
of Geography and Statistics - IBGE (2019), approximately 75% of farmers marketed their products in
Brazil in 2014. These products were primarily sold to final customers (35.7%), intermediaries (31.5%),
companies (22.8%), and cooperatives (7.6%). The marketing of agricultural products can increase
income and contribute significantly to improving food security, poverty reduction, and agricultural
development (Fafchamps, 2003; Carletto et al., 2017).
         However, small producers face challenges in choosing the best destination for production due
to market failures that may lead them to not being able to access the best marketing channels and
contractual arrangements, resulting in a failure to increase their earnings (Jayne et al., 2006). However,
cooperatives1 in rural areas have appeared as an alternative. These are mainly made up of associated
rural producers seeking to meet the needs related to their activities. These organizations serve as a
means of coordinating actors in the primary sector of the economy as well as an important method of
facilitating to the market and related services. In Brazil, these organizations account for approximately
40% of the gross value of agricultural production (GVP) in agriculture and livestock (IBGE, 2019).
         In this article, we estimated the effect of marketing through cooperatives in household income,
as well as in their distribution in rural areas of Brazil. To determine the influence of selling to
cooperatives on family income, the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) of 2014 was used,
which has a supplement with relevant information regarding the rural environment and the method of
income decomposition proposed by Firpo et al. (2007). This approach consists of two steps: i) income
regressions are estimated for different non-conditional quantile of income distribution; ii) the income
differential is decomposed to identify the main factors (e.g., farmers' schooling and access to rural
extension) that explain income differences between those who are cooperated and those who are not
cooperated for each quantile analyzed.
         In addition to this introduction, the present article contains a section presenting a brief
description of cooperatives and their relation to the market. Next, the data and methods used to obtain
the results are presented, which are discussed in the following section, which is then followed by the
final considerations.

2 The Role of Cooperatives in Marketing

        Farm product commercialization is associated with high farm income. Marketing farm products
can increase income and contribute significantly to improving food security, poverty reduction, and
agricultural development. These points were verified by Fafchamps (2003) in his work on sub-Saharan
Africa and by Carletto et al. (2017), who analyzed these issues in Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda.
Continuing within the African context, Jayne et al. (2006) demonstrated that greater coordination and
transparency among actors are required to achieve reasonable levels of food price, which would
culminate in raising income in rural areas. Notably, in developing countries, where trade is often

  Although the word “cooperative” can be applied to different types of collectively developed activities, we use the term
to describe a democratically controlled and managed business model. In many countries, including Brazil, cooperatives are
legally defined as a specific type of corporation and are subject to specific federal legislation (Zeuli and Radel, 2005).


                                                                                                                        2
characterized by market failures and monopolistic structures, cooperatives can represent an attractive
option for commercialization (Bernard and Spielman, 2009). These ventures favor vertical integration
by improving the linkage of its members to the market.
        Therefore, Sexton and Iskow (1988) argue that vertical integration makes sense when
transactions are more efficient occurring internally (i.e., via a company) than through the market alone.
However, under certain circumstances, the market will always be the most efficient way to conduct
transactions. This occurs when certain key conditions characterizing the so-called "competitive
markets" are met: i) they have a large number of buyers and sellers; ii) they allow the free entry and
exit of companies; iii) there is no differentiation between the transacted products and; iv) there is
symmetry of information between agents.
        In markets with these characteristics, farmers would receive the highest possible price for their
products and pay the lowest possible price for inputs. Therefore, there would be no incentives for the
existence of cooperatives. However, most of today's markets do not meet all of these characteristics,
thus making it advantageous for rural producers to override market agents and conduct their
transactions through a cooperative.
        According to Sexton and Iskow (1988), agricultural cooperatives and the determination of
agricultural prices can be analyzed through the concept of margins. For a given agricultural product,
we can denote the industry margin as M and the retail price of the final product as !" . Given # and !" ,
the maximum value, !$∗ , for the agricultural price, !$ , is:
                                        !$∗ = (!" − #)/+                                             (1)
where K is a commodity conversion factor in the final product (for example, twenty liters of milk are
required to produce one kilo of butter). As the industries that receive, process, distribute and sell the
perfectly competitive agricultural products, as described above, they would perform their functions
more efficiently, at the lowest possible cost, making margin M as small as possible. This same pressure
for efficiency would move !$ to the maximum possible value in equation (1). Any attempt by the
industry to pay rural producers less than this price would be frustrated since simple competition
between companies would induce the commodity price to its real level.
        However, when one of the conditions that characterize a perfect market is not observed,
equation (1) makes it possible to demonstrate how a cooperative can help raise the prices paid to
cooperated farmers. Next, two possible paths are exposed: a reduction in the margin of the companies
and the dilution of market forces.

       2.1 Reduction of the marketing margin

        If a cooperative can market an agricultural product at a lower cost than that of the existing
capital companies, margin M in equation (1) may be reduced.
        Williamson (1986) advocates that the internalization of transactions may play a prominent role
in reducing costs since it creates common incentives among participants. In the market, the seller
normally seeks the highest possible price, while the buyer usually seeks the lowest price. Thus, so-
called opportunistic behavior on the part of trading partners can arise, such as when perishable goods
sellers must ultimately accept lower prices given the reduced opportunities for stocking and reselling
their products. Similarly, farmers demanding inputs for immediate delivery are potentially vulnerable
to higher prices being charged by suppliers.
        According to Sexton and Iskow (1988), a cooperative and its members usually have common
goals, with farmers seeking better prices and the cooperative seeking to pay their members as much as
possible after covering their running costs. In the same way, cooperatives seek inputs at the lowest
prices, while the cooperative seeks to sell them as cheaply as possible and preferably in a planned
manner, according to technical guidance often provided by the cooperative itself.
        Thus, a reduction in the marketing margin obtained through cooperatives compared to that of
capital companies occurs due to the more harmonious exchange relations between these organizations


                                                                                                       3
and their members.

         2.2 Market power dilution

        In addition, if capital firms have market power over rural producers, they may also act
opportunistically, forcing them to accept a lower price than !$∗ , a situation that could be mitigated by
the creation of a cooperative.
        According to Zhang et al. (2007), farmers often organize themselves in cooperatives to sell
their products at prices higher than those obtained from capital companies. Thus, cooperative members
would optimize their total revenues, partly due to the sale of the products to the cooperative and partly
due to the purchase of inputs at better prices.
        However, the effects of these organizations on the local economy can be broader, since it is
understood that a cooperative will pay farmers more favorable prices by providing its members with
services at prices that only cover their costs without the need to obtain profit. As a consequence,
established capital companies would try to match the price level paid to the producers by the
cooperative so as not to lose them. Thus, the market would move closer to the competitive equilibrium
situation. Therefore, the beneficiaries of the cooperative would include: the cooperative members,
who, as previously mentioned, see their revenues increased; farmers that remain tied to capital
companies, but who now receive a better price; consumers who would have a greater choice of
products at a lower price (Christy, 1987; Sexton, 1986; Cotterill, 1997; Royer, 2014).
        These theoretical points may be manifesting for the Brazilian context, as seen in Figure 1,
which presents the positive effect of cooperativism on the income of members. Notably, those farmers
who transacted their products with the cooperatives obtained a higher income with more individuals
concentrated around the average (median) of the distribution of monthly income. This fact is indicated
by the existence of more producers in the region of higher income since this income is superior to the
other verified cases (in farm consumption, selling to companies, and selling to other marketing
channels).

3 Empirical strategy

         To estimate how marketing production affects (not causally) household income, data were used
from the National Sample Survey of Households (PNAD) 2014, provided by IBGE (2019). For 2014,
there was a special questionnaire that included questions related to access to credit and technical
assistance (extension) in rural areas. In PNAD, marketing of agricultural production2 is categorized
into: i) Company; ii) Cooperative; iii) Government; iv) Owner of the land; v) Intermediate; iv) Direct
consumer and; vii) Another buyer. In this work, a dummy variable with a value of 1 was constructed
when the option "Cooperative" was chosen. This was the proxy used to define whether farmer
marketed with cooperatives.
         The database used in this work is a sub-sample of the PNAD and follows the objective of
evaluating the effect of marketing with cooperatives before marketing alternatives. Thus, it includes
only rural households that have commercialized their production. Similar to Ely et al. (2017), the sub-
sample considers rural producers as being: 1) economically active; 2) employers or self-employed
workers (these being the individuals interviewed in the questionnaire); 3) individuals with agricultural
activity as their primary occupation. The sample also covers rural producers living in urban areas.
After the exclusion of missing values and possible outliers, the sample was 15,402 individuals. Then,
considering the domicile focus of this study (i.e., those who marketed), the final sample was 11,419
individuals (see Table 1).
         The dependent variable was the monthly household income in R$, which served as a proxy for
rural property income. In order to control other factors besides marketing through cooperatives, which
may influence the level of household income, the model also includes other variables:
    a) Rural credit – dummy that assumes a value of 1 if the individual has obtained rural credit
         (includes the Family Agriculture Strengthening Program - PRONAF and credit from other
         sources);
    b) Rural extension – a dummy variable equals 1 if the individual has received technical assistance
         and rural extension from a private or governmental source;
    c) Gender – a dummy variable equals 1 if the individual is male;
    d) Race – a dummy variable equals 1 if the individual is black;
    e) Schooling – several dummy variables split into the categories “does not read and write” (base),
         “incomplete elementary school”, “complete elementary school”, “incomplete high school”,
         “complete high school”, “incomplete higher education”, and “complete higher education”;
    f) Age – Several dummies, distributed in "up to 25 years" (base), "age 26 to 35 years", "age 36 to
         45 years", "age 46 to 55 years", "age 56 to 65 years", and "age 65 years or higher";
    g) Rural – a dummy variable equals 1 if the individual resides in a rural area;
    h) Land ownership – several dummy variables seek to identify the condition of the producer in
         relation to the land, such as whether the producer is a partner, tenant, occupant, owner (base),
         or another condition;
    i) Farm size – four dummy variables represent farm size, which is divided into very small (up to
         10 hectares (ha)) (base), small (10 to 100 ha), medium (100 to 1000 ha), and large (> 1000 ha);
    j) Regions – five dummy variables represent Brazilian macro-regions – North, Northeast (base),
         Southeast, South, and Midwest.

  The PNAD question for which the variable of interest of this research is based on is the following: "Buyer who acquired
all or most of the main production of the farm that was sold in the 365-day reference period".

        The descriptive statistics presented in Table 1 consider the different categories of
commercialization. Based on the sample used in the present study, approximately 70% of rural
households held the marketing of their agricultural production. Of these, nearly 8% sold to cooperatives
in 2014.
        The average income of those who traded in production was R$ 2,609.00, which was higher than
the average of the rural producers (R$ 2,505.00), yet significantly lower than those who dealt with
cooperatives (R$ 4,670.00). In addition, it is possible to verify a high level of heterogeneity in
household income, as demonstrated by the large standard deviation for this variable.
        Other notable trends include the higher overall levels of education among those who traded
with cooperatives. These individuals also had more access to rural credit and rural extension services.
        The majority of those who traded with cooperatives in 2014 were in the South region of Brazil
(50.7%), followed by those living in the Southeast (23.4%). In contrast, only ~5% of those who
marketed their products in the Northeast did so through cooperatives.
        Based on this data, we sought to determine the effects (not causality) of marketing with
cooperatives on family income. First, we used the non-conditional quantile regression method to
identify the effect of marketing via cooperatives on producers in different income levels in the Brazilian
rural area according to the methods of Firpo et al. (2007, 2009). Then, we identified family
characteristics that can generate income disparities given the marketing of rural production to
cooperatives.

        3.1 The unconditional quantile regression approach

        To identify the effects (not causality) of marketing products with cooperatives on rural income
and income inequality, we used the unconditional quantile regression approach proposed by Firpo et
al. (2009) and the concept of recentered influence function (RIF). The influence function3 facilitates
the identification of the relative effect (influence) of an individual observation on a statistic of interest
(Silva and França, 2017). That is, for a distribution statistic !(#$ ), the influence of each observation
on !(#$ ) is given by the influence function &#('; !, #$ ). The incorporation of the statistic !(#$ ) in the
influence function results in the so-called RIF, *&#('; !) = !(') + &#('; !). This allows an analysis
of the effects of individual covariates on the statistical distribution of interest. While we are interested
in the distribution of the quantiles, it can also be applied to different statistical distributions such as the
Gini coefficient, variance, or others that represent income inequality4.
        We define the t-th quantile (-. ) of the income distribution Y as-. = !. (#$ ) = /012 3-: #$ (-) ≥
67, and its influence function &#('; -. , #$ ) as:
                                                6 − 13' ≤ -. (#$ )7
                             &#('; -. , #$ ) =                                                             (2)
                                                    1$ (-. (#$ ))
where 13' ≤ -. (#$ )7 is an indicator function that shows whether the variable Y (monthly household
income) is less than or equal to the quantile qt , and 1$ (-. (#$ )) represents the marginal density function
of the distribution of Y evaluated in -. .
        The RIF, which will replace the dependent variable Y in the unconditional quantile analysis, is
defined by the sum of the distribution statistics and their respective influence function, *&#('; !, #$ ) =


3
  The influence function method provides a linear approximation for a nonlinear function of a statistical distribution of
interest, such as quantiles, variance or others, thus allowing an estimate of the effect of one or more covariates on the
distribution of the statistics of interest (Chi and Li, 2008).
4
  For an average, e.g., ;(#$ ), the influence function - IF, would be given by &#('; ;(#$ )) = ' − ;(#$ ), with the RIF
specified as: *&#('; ;) = &#('; ;) + ;. Firpo et al. (2007) present the RIF regressions for the case of the variance and
Gini coefficient.


                                                                                                                       7
!(#$ ) + &#('; !, #$ ). Thus, adapting the expression to the t - th quantile (-. ), the RIF for each income
quantile is given by:
                                  6 − 13' ≤ -. (#$ )7
          *&#('; -. , #$ ) = -. +                     = <=. . 13' ≤ -. (#$ )7 + <?.                     (3)

                     =
where <=. = @                and <?. = -. − <=. . (1 − 6) and the conditional expectation is !(#$ ) (Firpo et al.,
                   A (2B )
2009; Silva and França, 2017). This implies that:
                               CD*&#('; !, #$ )E = !(#$ )                                                                       (4)
                                                               ∧
           We first obtain the sample quantile                 -.   (Firpo et al., 2009; Koenker and Basset, 1978) and then
                                              ∧   ∧

                                        through kernel functions5. After obtaining these estimates, they
are incorporated in equation (3).
        We assume a covariate vector X and the conditional expectation of the RIF as a function of X;
i.e. CD*&#('; !, #$ )|K = LE. Then, it can be represented as a linear regression in the function
X,*&#('; !, #$ ) = KM + N. Assuming C [N|K] = 0 and applying the Law of Iterated Expectations, we
have the unconditional quantile regression:
                         !(#$ ) = CR SCD*&#('; !, #$ )ET = C [K]. M                                  (5)
where y represents the monthly rural household income; *&#('; !, #$ ) is the RIF, which replaces the
observed y in each observation; X is the vector of explanatory variables described in the previous
section; and M are the coefficients of interest, which capture the effect of changing the distribution of
a variable on the unconditional quantile of y or the unconditional quantile partial effect (Firpo et al.,
2009). These coefficients can be estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) or another linear estimator6.
        The conditional quantile regression approach proposed by Koenker and Basset (1978) differs
from the unconditional quantile regression proposed by Firpo et al. (2007, 2009) that is used in the
present study. The former approach only allows the estimation of "within-group"7 effect (Firpo et al.,
2009), while the unconditional quantile regression allows the estimation of both "within-group" effect
and "between-group" effect. The latter effect represents the influence of a given variable throughout
the entire distribution.

           3.2 Decomposition of income differentials

        We use an income decomposition procedure proposed by Firpo et al. (2007)8 to estimate the
income differentials between groups (i.e., farmers that have marketed with cooperatives and farmers
that did not). This involves estimating the RIF regression along with a reweighting scheme proposed
by DiNardo et al. (1996). It is an adaptation of the Oaxaca-Blinder9 decomposition approach, which
allows us to expand the decomposition to other statistics of interest such as quantiles, variance, and
Gini coefficient.

                                                                                                                   ∧
5
 According to Koenker and Basset (1978), the t - th quantile estimator of the marginal distribution of Y (-. ) can be defined
    ∧
as: -. = UVW X/0 ∑]
                  ^_=(6 − 1{[/ − - ≤ 0}). ([/ − -). The density function of Y is obtained by estimating the kernel
                   2
           ∧                                  ∧
               ∧       =              cd e2B
density:   1$ G-. H = ].` . ∑]
                             ^_= a$   b   `
                                                  f, where a$ (g) is a kernel function and b is a positive scalar bandwidth. For more
details, see Firpo et al. (2009).
6
  Firpo et al. (2009) present three possibilities of estimators: OLS, logistic estimator, and a non-parametric estimator—all
with very similar results.
7
  The result for each quantile depends on the X characteristics of the individuals in that group and cannot be extrapolated
to the other quantiles. It does not allow the analysis of the effect of a given variable on the entire Y distribution.
8
  This method has been used in other studies, such as Machado and Mata (2005).

                                                                                                                                   8
         We assume two groups of households: A (farmers that have accessed rural credit) and B (farmers
that have not accessed rural credit); a result variable Y (logarithm of household incomes); and a group
of covariates that represent individuals’ characteristics. The decomposition seeks to identify the
difference in the income distribution of the two groups based on some statistics of these distributions,
as opposed to only analyzing the mean. This is represented as:
                                     hi = !(#$j ) − !(#$k )                                              (6)
where !(#$l ) represents a statistic of the income distribution (income quantiles, in this paper) for two
groups t = A, B.
         The term hi is then divided into two components: the difference in the observable individual
characteristics (composition effect) and the difference in coefficients between the two groups (return
effect). To implement this decomposition, a counterfactual distribution (#$m ) must first be obtained in
addition to its statistics of interest !(#$m ) such as in equation (5). This allows us to simulate an income
distribution with the characteristics of group A and the returns (coefficients) to the characteristics of
group B. We can insert #$m in equation (6) to obtain:
                         hi = D!(#$k ) − !(#$m )E + D!(#$n ) − !(#$j )E
                                                                                                         (7)
                                          hi = hio + hpi
where the total income differential is decomposed into two terms: hio , which represents the portion of
the differential resulting from the differences in the returns (coefficients) of the characteristics (return
effect); and hpi , which represents the portion of the differential associated with the differences in the
distributions of the characteristics (composition effect).
         To obtain equation (7) we re-estimate the RIF regressions for each of the groups and obtain the
conditional expectation of the recentered functions of influence. This allows us to obtain the expected
value of the RIF for the observed distributions !(#$l ) and the counterfactual distribution!(#$n ) in a
linear specification:
                           !(#$l ) = C [*&#('l ; !l )|K, q = r ] = Kl Ml                                 (8)
                                       [                        ]
                          !(#$n ) = C *&#('j ; !n )|K, q = s = Kn Mn                                     (9)
for t = A, B. To obtain the parameters of interest M, Firpo et al. (2007) used a reweighting technique
based on DiNardo et al. (1996). The reweighting factors for each group are:

4 Results and Discussion

        In this section, we first present the results of the non-conditional quantile regression. Next, we
present the results of the income decomposition, including a brief regional analysis of the income
differential decomposition.

       4.1 The influence of marketing via cooperatives on income

         In this section, we present the results of the RIF regressions for the quantiles of the logarithm
for the monthly household income of those who market their products through cooperatives, as well
as the estimation by OLS. The coefficients we estimated exhibited some variation along the income
quantiles in relation to the estimated coefficients obtained for the mean. This result reinforces the need
to use the non-conditional quantile regression approach. In Table 2, we present the results of the RIF
regressions. The results suggest a positive effect if farmers commercialize with cooperatives, with the
exception of those producers in income quantile q75, for whom the effect was not significant. This
effect on income becomes greater in the highest income quantiles. For example, in the two lower
quantiles (q10 and q25), the household income of those who trade with cooperatives is linked to
incomes of 5.9% (or R$ 29.92 on average) and 11.1% (or R$ 97.90 on average) higher than those who
do not market via cooperatives. The effect on the median (q50) is 17.9% higher (R$ 303.94 on average)
and is higher in q90 (R$ 988.93). These results demonstrate that commercialization through
cooperatives can be related to positive effects on household income throughout all quantiles
considered. Positive effects of better coordination with the productive chains via corporate bodies
could exist, as recommended by Sexton and Iskow (1988) and Zhang et al. (2007), as well as by Jayne
et al. (2006) and Bernard and Spielman (2009) for African cases.
         Also, within the scope of Table 2, we can verify how other variables considered in this study
affect the quantiles of the logarithm for monthly household income in the rural environment among
those who market their products. Rural credit had a positive and increasing effect in relation to income
quantiles—except for q90, where it was not significant. That is, despite raising income in rural areas,
access to rural credit increases its uneven distribution. This was also the finding of Neves et al. (2018b)
as well as Vega (1987), Bacha, Danelon and Belson (2005), and Araújo (2011), who found evidence
of large farmers gaining more access to credit than small farmers.

        Rural extension is another public policy associated with agricultural production that seeks to
generate improvements in agricultural production and income. This policy helps farmers access new
technologies and knowledge and is traditionally associated with cooperativism in Brazil (Cechin,
2014). The results suggest that access to rural extension also generates higher income in all quantiles
of the distribution. Throughout the larger quantiles of income distribution (q75 and q90) farmers who
had access to rural extension obtained 37% and 49% higher income, respectively, than those that did
not have access to the service.
        Variables such as gender and race, when significant, did not exhibit large variation among
income quantiles. However, men in Q90 had higher incomes than women. The farmers’ experience—
represented by the age classes—had a great effect on the oldest class (age 65 or higher) and was
concentrated in the median of income distribution (q50).
        Schooling, regardless of its class, always has a positive effect throughout the quantiles when
compared to those who cannot read or write. Oliveira and Silveira Neto (2015), Costa et al. (2016),
and Reis et al. (2017) also identified the positive effects of human capital investments on income. We
noticed a greater effect of other classes of schooling in the initial quantiles, which demonstrates its
potential to reduce income inequality from investment in human capital in the countryside.
        Owning land and living in urban areas leads to a higher household income. We believe that
farm owners have a greater incentive to invest in long-term innovations and technologies that
contribute to increasing rural incomes. Already living in urban areas can lead to greater access to
information about market entry, banking institutions, and other services.
        The results suggest that the larger the property, the higher the income, and that the families in
the South, Midwest and Southeast are more financially secure compared to families in the North and
mainly Northeast (base category). These differences were also identified in the literature (Assunção
and Chein, 2007; Souza, Ney and Ponciano, 2013; Oliveira and Neto, 2015; Costa et al., 2016).

       4.2 Decomposition of income differentials

        Data analysis indicated differences in the characteristics of rural properties with and without
marketing with cooperatives. The results presented in the previous subsection also indicated
differences in the return of the commercialization with cooperatives on household income in the
different quantiles. In this section, we identify the magnitude of the income differential and the factors
that explain this difference. The income decomposition method is used in conjunction with RIF
regressions to evaluate how much of the income differences observed between the groups of
households is attributed to the composition effect and the return effect. The first effect represents
differences in the distribution of the characteristics of the individuals, while the second represents
differences in the returns of these characteristics. This allows us to identify the contribution of each
covariate in each of the estimated effects. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 3, as well
as in Figure 2-6.
        Rural households that opted for marketing through cooperatives obtained income gains in all
estimations made (one for each quantile) compared to those who did not sell to cooperatives (see Figure
2). We also noticed that the effect of cooperativism is greater among the smaller quantiles (q10 and
q20). This result is important since it indicates a potential effect of reducing inequality of income in
rural areas. The higher the income quantiles, the lower the effect of cooperativism on the income
differential between those who are cooperated and those who do not sell to cooperatives. In other
words, a good contribution is made to small and poor farmers. There is a more intense reduction of the
income differential between cooperatives and non-cooperatives for the lowest quantiles.
        As verified by Neves et al. (2018b) for rural credit, and by Freitas et al. (2018) for rural
extension, minimizing income inequality in rural areas remains a significant challenge to be overcome
by Brazilian public policies for the primary sector of the economy. Cooperativism is also fostered by

some public policies, such as RECOOP10, the PRODECOOP11, and the PROCAP-AGRO12. This has
the potential to raise the income of those who trade with them, as advocated by Zhang et al. (2007).
Moreover, in addition to this benefit to the cooperative producers, we can affirm that by working to
minimize market failures they are also managing to reduce income inequality in the Brazilian
countryside.

        In general, we highlight that the composition effect (total explained) accounts for most of the
total income difference, especially when considering quantiles above q25. This implies that differences
in personal characteristics, such as schooling, access to credit, and rural extension explain—in most
quantiles—much of the total income gap in these quantiles. Below q25, the income difference is
explained equally by both composition effect and return effect (total unexplained).

        In both Table 3 and Figure 3, we detail the composition effect in its various components. Above
q25, access to rural extension is the factor that best explains the higher level of income of households
that market with cooperatives in comparison with those that do not. Cechin (2014) states that Brazilian
cooperatives are an important source of technical assistance for the production of their cooperative. In
addition, it is worth noting that rural extension provides both knowledge of production techniques and
managerial skills, which is important in guiding farmers in the process of marketing their products
(Christoplos, 2010).
        From q50, we highlight the relevance of schooling in explaining part of the difference between
cooperative and non-cooperative. Freitas (2017) considers that higher levels of education enable rural
producers to better assimilate information, make better crop choices, and implement technical
recommendations more accurately. Greater access to information reduces information asymmetry and
has the potential to make the marketing process fairer to farmers.
        We point out that rural credit (including the Family Agriculture Strengthening Program -
PRONAF) appears as a relevant factor in explaining the income gap between cooperative and non-
cooperative farmers. Access to rural credit allows farmers to invest in new technologies, increase
production, and better market their products (Luan and Bauer, 2016). Rural credit has a lower effect
on q10, but gains importance mainly between q25 and q75, with less relevance in Q90. Moreover,
there is an effect on the increase in inequality between the lowest income quantile (q10) and the others,
with a reduction in the effect on the inequality between those households with co-workers who obtain
credit in quantiles from q25 to q75 compared to those in q90.

        The effect of property size is U-shaped, indicating that additional farm area has the greatest
effect on q10 and q90 in explaining the higher income of the cooperative over the non-cooperative
groups. Therefore, this a characteristic that interacted with the commercialization with cooperatives,
reducing income inequality up to the median, and raising it from the median onward.
        Regional disparities continue to be relevant in Brazilian rural areas, as suggested by Azzoni
(2001), Alves (2013) and Costa et al. (2016). The effect of living in the South region explains the
higher level of income of households marketing with cooperatives in comparison with those that do
not (Northeast – base category) (see Figure 4). On a smaller scale, living in the Southeast represents a
gain for the cooperative group compared to those living in the Northeast. These results are unsurprising
given the relevance of the cooperative movement in the South and Southeast regions. Work performed
by Neves, Castro and Freitas (2018) demonstrates the relevance of cooperativism in the gross value of
agricultural production (GVP) of the Brazilian regions, highlighting positive effects in the South,
Southeast and—to a lesser extent—the Central-West. The North and Northeast Regions are negatively
influenced by the cooperative activity in their GVPs.
        It is important to note that if the cooperatives in the Northeast had the same attributes as those
living in the South and Southeast at their disposal, they would have greater gains in income compared
to those non-members.

       We also performed a decomposition of the return effect, as seen in Table 3 and Figure 5. This
was performed to better understand how the return to household characteristics affects income.
Although an erratic effect of schooling on rural income can be observed, this variable contributes
considerably to income in the median (q50) and q75. The opposite is true for the lowest quantiles (q10
and q25). In general, most variables had a similar and negative influence on income differentials.

       In addition, the lower proportion of farms under good conditions in these regions also
contributes to the increase of the marginal effect of the attributes analyzed in the research. SESCOOP-
PE (2007), in a specific analysis of the Northeastern state of Pernambuco, found low schooling even
among those producers who run cooperatives. This reflects the Northeastern regional reality, which is
also among the findings of Silva et al. (2003). There are other possible explanations: poor infrastructure
and the distance of the consumer market in the North and Northeast can make it unfeasible for farmers
to exercise their full potential.

5 Concluding remarks

         In the present article, we estimated the influence of cooperativism in the generation and
distribution of income since income inequality persists in rural areas of Brazil. The results indicated
that, rather than increasing income, Brazilian cooperativism has the potential to minimize the disparity
in its distribution.
         There was a greater effect for the larger income quantiles, as demonstrated by non-conditional
quantile regression. However, the difference in income between those who trade with cooperatives and
those who trade through other channels decreases with increasing income quantiles, as perceived by
the decomposition of the income differential. Thus, the results suggest that cooperativism emerges as
a relevant marketing channel to raise the income of small farmers.
         Furthermore, important regional disparities have been verified. It is possible that in the
Northeast and North regions, cooperativism is not the organizational form most appropriate to the
context of the development of collective movements. In these places, informal groups, associations,
rural unions, and other types of associative enterprises can be the most indicated, generating positive
results by the congregation of rural producers. The results also highlight that characteristics such as



                                                                                                       17
higher schooling and access to extension are potentialized when the producer resides in the South and
Southeast of the country. Notably, poor infrastructure and distance from the consumer market in the
North and Northeast may be related to this finding.
        Finally, we consider that the estimates presented in this paper are useful for public
policymakers since they measure the performance of cooperatives as a means of growth and economic
development in rural communities. Although we consider public policies when we verify that higher
levels of education, credit, and access to rural extension have increased the effect of marketing with
cooperatives on income, we suggest that policies integrating cooperativism, rural credit, rural
extension, and the promotion of human capital would be more effective due to the synergy of these
components.
        Also, the representative bodies of the cooperative sector can use the results of studies of this
nature to demonstrate the importance of the participation of cooperatives in the economy.
Consequently, this representative bodies can justify the demand for investments directed to the
propagation of cooperative education aimed at the development of these organizations.
