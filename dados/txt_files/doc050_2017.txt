      This paper applies a multivariate Kalman Filter to estimate the Neutral Real Inter-
      est Rate (NRIR) in Brazil, from 2002Q1 to 2016Q4. Our state space representation
      combines macroeconomic models with the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter approach. This
      framework differs from previous literature in two aspects: (1) departing from a produc-
      tion function with two factors (capital and labor), we introduce more structure in the
      potential output state equation; (2) this procedure results in a state space representa-
      tion that allow us to make a join estimation of four latent variables: NRIR, potential
      output, NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) and NAICU (non-
      accelerating inflation rate of capacity utilization).

1     Introduction
             The neutral real interest rate (NRIR)1 was first introduced by Wicksell (1936),
whose work basically defines this variable as the one associated with long run equilibrium
in the economy. The concern about NRIR in monetary policy grows after Taylor (1993)
implicitly showed that there is an interest rate associated with steady state in terms of
inflation and income. In turn, Woodford (2003) enhanced the role of the NRIR in a New
Keynesian environment as the real interest rate that would prevail in the absence of price
and wage rigidity in short to medium term.
             However, as Blinder (1999) emphasized, once this variable is hard to measure
and its estimates are usually accompanied by a great deal of uncertainty, the NRIR should
be thought more as a way of thinking monetary policy than as the basis for a mechanical
rule. Orphanides and Williams (2002) makes us aware of this by showing that the adoption
of policy rules optimized under the false presumption that the uncertainties regarding the
NRIR are small proves particularly costly in terms of stabilizing inflation and unemployment.
             Anyway, this controversy over the NRIR is not apparently enough to diminish its
role as a guidance for central bankers. The variable is often identified in public communica-
tions of monetary authorities around the world, both in developed and emerging economies.
As an example for the former, Yellen (2017) underline the importance of the NRIR for assess-
ing the monetary policy stance in US economy. As an example for the latter, Central Banks
in India ( Reserve Bank of India (2017) ) and Brazil ( Central Bank of Brazil (2017) ) have
mentioned the NRIR dynamics in the minutes of their monetary policy committee meetings
as a reference for its decisions. In this sense, this variable still occupies an outstanding
position in monetary policy, which justifies the efforts in measuring its level.
             Usually, the literature sheds light on how the deviations of the short term interest
rate from its estimated long-run value is related to inflation and business cycle variables.
Woodford (2003) enhanced this framework, where the NRIR arises from as interest rule
and varies continuously in response to real economy shocks. In this sense, if the short
term interest rate is set under (above) its neutral value, we would expect to observe prices
rising (declining) and key economic activity variables skipping from its steady-state values:
the output should be above (under) the potential output, the unemployment rate should
be under (above) the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) and the
installed capacity utilization should be above (under) the NAICU (non-accelerating inflation
rate of capacity utilization). These relationships highlight an important issue: any deviation
of the mentioned observed variables from its long run values could be seen as a clue that the
real interest rate (RIR) is not at its neutral level.
             However, once the long run variables cannot be directly observed, how to measure
its values is a challenge for economists. Regarding the NRIR, Giammarioli and Valla (2004)
present an overview about the methods usually applied to estimate its level. Among these
methods, we focus on the one that applies Kalman filter in order to obtain a proxy for the
latent variable using information provided by activity and prices dynamics.
             Laubach and Williams (2003) is one of the key studies in this group. Originally
   1
     As enhanced by Bernhardsen and Gerdrup (2007), the concepts “neutral real interest rate”, “natural
real interest rate” and “normal real interest rate” are used interchangeably in the literature. We use the
expression Neutral Real Interest Rate (NRIR) in this article.

developed for the U.S. economy, in their framework the NRIR is related with the growth rate
of output trend and an unobserved variable introduced in order to measure effects linked
to other of its components (as the intertemporal consumer’s preference). This arrangement
arises from traditional economic relationships often observed in mainstream macroeconomic
theory: an IS curve (Aggregate Demand), a Phillips curve (Aggregate Supply) and an interest
rate rule.
             Following Laubach and Williams (2003), other studies presented similar strategies
to estimate the natural interest rate in other developed economies. For the Euro Area,
Mésonnier and Renne (2004) introduced a new equation for the NRIR, comprised by a
constant parameter and a total productivity factor component. Bernhardsen and Gerdrup
(2007) estimate the NRIR in Norway by means of the Kalman filter, using a model that
comprises four equations: the first split the RIR in the NRIR and a ciclycal i.i.d component;
the second decomposes the NRIR in a constant that is set as the productivity growth and a
disturbance that explains the deviations of the neutral from the long-term real interest rate
(LRIR); the third defines the last disturbance as an AR(1) process; the fourth is an IS curve.
In this simpler framework, there is a distinction between the NRIR and the LRIR. While
the latter is determined by factors like potential output and long-term savings, the former
is additionally influenced by various disturbances linked to the supply and demand side of
the economy in medium term.2 3 Holston et al. (2016) estimates a version of the Laubach
and Williams (2003) model using data from the United States and three other advanced
economies (Canada, the Euro Area, and the United Kingdom). They highlight four key
results: (i) all four economies presented evidence of time-variation in the NRIR; (ii) all four
economies registered large declines in trend GDP growth and natural rates of interest over
the past 25 years; (iii) although estimation is done on a economy-by-economy basis, there
is substantial comovement in the estimates of the natural rates of interest and trend GDP
growth across economies; and (iv) the estimates of the NRIR are highly imprecise, reinforcing
a key finding of the original Laubach and Williams (2003) paper.
             In similar approaches, but applied for Brazilian economy, Barcellos Neto and
Portugal (2009), Magud and Tsounta (2012), Araújo and Silva (2014), Gottlieb (2013) and
Machado and Portugal (2014) present versions of the Laubach and Williams (2003) model
to estimate the NRIR. In turn, Ribeiro and Teles (2013) applies both Laubach and Williams
(2003) and Mésonnier and Renne (2004) to estimate the NRIR in Brazil.
             A common point in these state space models is that all of them make a join
estimation of the NRIR and the potential output, imposing for the latter a structure that
depends on unobservable components that follows a random walk or have an autoregressive
pattern.
   2
     As Bernhardsen and Gerdrup (2007) enhances, in the neoclassical theory, the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans
model express that the real interest rate in the long term is related to economic fundamentals, been directly
proportional to potential output (given by the sum of productivity and population growth) and household
rate of time preference (concept associate with the long-term savings rate). A more detailed discussion about
this model can be found in Romer (2001).
   3
     Another important remark from Bernhardsen and Gerdrup (2007) is that in small open economies, due
to free movements of capital hypothesis, the NRIR is dependent on global interest rate and the exchange
rate. This last issue can be related with Galı́ and Monacelli (2005) finding that both the natural levels of
output and interest rates in the small open economy are generally a function of both domestic and foreign
disturbances.


                                                     3
             Other part of the literature, although uses alternative methods to the ones men-
tioned before, highlights issues that are relevant for the determination of the NRIR in Brazil.
Bacha et al. (2009), Bacha (2010) and Goldfajn and Bicalho (2011) present evidences that
some structural factors as the dollarization, the country risk rating and the public debt are
relevant to explain the RIR level in Brazil. More recently, Barbosa et al. (2016) claims that
some studies that uses the Taylor Rule as a reference to obtain the NRIR in Brazil do not
consider the reaction function properties’ in a small open economy, where variables linked to
overseas can affect the domestic fundamentals, which leads to a specification error. In this
sense, making reference to the Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIRP), the authors calculate
a measure of the NRIR applying a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) Filter over a sum of variables
related to the international real rate of interest, the premium due to country risk and the
premium due to the exchange rate risk.
             Considering these aspects, the aim of this study is to present an expanded version
of the Mésonnier and Renne (2004) model, built over Brazilian data. Our model differs
from the mentioned literature in two aspects. First, using as reference Areosa (2008), we
introduce more structure in the potential output state equation. Areosa (2008) proposes
a methodology that combines the production function approach and the HP filtering in
a multivariate Kalman Filter, which simultaneously produces estimates for the potential
output and its unobservable components. Second, this procedure results in a state space
representation that allow us to make a join estimation of four latent economic variables:
NRIR, potential output, NAIRU and NAICU.
             Applying our model to evaluate the monetary policy stance in our sample period,
we observed that in the first half of our data, tighter monetary policy prevailed. The last
period of policy easing began in the aftermath of 2008 financial crisis and sustained till the
first half of 2014. Since then, Brazil Central Bank has been adopting a tighter monetary
stance. Also, we highlight increasing idle productive capacity linked to both capital and
labor factors.
             The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the theoretical
background, presenting the models proposed by Laubach and Williams (2003), Mésonnier
and Renne (2004) and Areosa (2008). In section 3, we introduce our state space model.
Section 4 focuses on data description. Section 5 depicts the results (i) comparing the latent
variables estimates from our model with an original HP filter framework and (ii) using our
state space model to evaluate the monetary policy stance in Brazil during our sample period
(2002Q1-2016Q4). Section 6 concludes.


2     Theoretical Background

2.1    The Laubach and Williams (2003) model
           The basic specification for the NRIR in Laubach and Williams (2003) is inspired
on the neoclassical growth model. The Euler Equation that results from the household
intertemporal CRRA (Constant Relative Risk Aversion) utility maximization yields a re-
lationship that shows this latent variable being explained by shifts in preferences and the


                                              4
growth rate of output. Based on this theoretical link, the following state-equation gives the
law of motion for the NRIR (rt∗ ) :

                                               rt∗ = φgt + zt ,                                          (2.1)
where gt denotes the trend growth rate of the potential output, φ is interpreted as the
constant relative risk aversion 4 and zt is a control for other determinants of the NRIR. This
last component follows a random walk, which originates another state equation:

                                              zt = zt−1 + z,t .                                         (2.2)
            As the remaining state equations, the log potential output is specified as a random
walk with a stochastic drift given by the trend growth rate of the potential output, that itself
follows a random walk:

                                                ∗
                                         yt∗ = yt−1 + gt−1 + y∗ ,t .                                    (2.3)
                                              gt = gt−1 + g,t .                                         (2.4)
           The next step is to define functions for demand and supply side of the economy.
Following Holston et al. (2016), we will present the reduced-form equations of, respectively,
an IS (equation 2.5) and a Phillips curve (equation 2.6) that arise from the open economy
version of the New Keynesian model ( Galı́ (2008) ). These specifications follow closely
the small semi-structural model presented by BCB (2015) and comprise the measurement
equations:
                                                         2
                                                      α3 X           ∗
                         ht = α1 ht−1 + α2 ht−2 +           (rt−j − rt−j ) + h,t ,                      (2.5)
                                                      2 j=1

                             πt = β1 πt−1 + (1 − β1 )πt−2,4 + β3 ht−1 + π,t                             (2.6)
            In this setting, ht is the output gap, given by the output deviation from its
potential. rt and rt∗ are the RIR and NRIR, respectively. πt is the consumer price inflation.
πt−2,4 is the average consumer price inflation of its second to fourth lags. h,t and π,t are
error terms (i.i.d. ∼ N(0,σi2 ), for i=h,π). The long-run verticality of the Phillips curve is
imposed in equation 2.6. Besides, these two equations are consistent with the hypothesis
that price stability is reached when the RIR and the output are equal to their respective
long term equilibrium (NRIR and potential output).

2.2     The Mésonnier and Renne (2004) model
          Mésonnier and Renne (2004) follow a simpler structure than Laubach and Williams
(2003). The main difference are the state equations, that hold the following specifications:

                                               rt∗ = µr + φgt                                            (2.7)
   4
    This parameter corresponds to the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, that arises from
the Ramsey model applying a standard CRRA utility function for the representative household


                                                      5
                                                    ∗
                                        yt∗ = µy + yt−1 + gt + y,t .                                     (2.8)
                                              gt = ρgt−1 + g,t .                                         (2.9)
                                                yt = yt∗ + ht .                                         (2.10)
             The variables have the same interpretation of the ones in last section, with few
adaptations. Once more, the errors terms are i.i.d. and normally distributed. In this
setting, the NRIR and the potential output dynamics have a common component linked to
trend growth rate (subject to low frequency fluctuations), which follows an AR(1) process
(equation 2.9). For instance, φ is interpreted as the constant relative risk aversion 5 . The
parameters µr e µy stand for the rate of time preference of consumers 6 and the average
potential output growth rate, respectively. The measurement equation remains similar to
the ones presented in last section.
             In this structure, unlike Laubach and Williams (2003), there is no need to extract
two non-observable variables (gt and zt ) from another variable that is also non-observable
(rt∗ ). Accordingly to the authors, this strategy makes the estimation easier and more reliable.

2.3     The Areosa (2008) model
           Areosa (2008) uses Brazilian data to apply a methodology that combines the
production function approach and the HP filtering in a multivariate Kalman Filter, which
simultaneously produces estimates for the potential output, the NAIRU and the NAICU. In
order to assess these non-observable variables, this framework departs from a Cobb-Douglas
production function with constant returns to scale and defines the following equation:

                                yt = yt∗ + γ(et − e∗t ) + (1 − γ)(ct − c∗t )                            (2.11)
              Following the same terminology from previous sections, yt and yt∗ are the log
output and its potential. As we introduce for the first time, ct is the log capacity utilization,
c∗t is the log NAICU, et is the log employment rate and e∗t is the log NAIRE (non-accelerating
inflation rate of employment). The NAIRU is obtained as 1-Et∗ , with the upper-case variable
denoting the exponential of the corresponding lower-case variable. In this approach, the
equation 2.11 is explored as one of the measurement equations. The output elasticities of
labor and capital are represented by γ and (1-γ), respectively.
              The remaining state space model follow closely Boone (2000). Departing from
a HP filter structure for the state equations based on Harvey (1985), a multivariate filter
similar to Laxton and Tetlow (1992) is implemented, adding a Phillips Curve in the set of
measurement equations. Considering the most complete specification presented by Areosa
(2008), the resulting system is given by three transition equations and four measurement
equations, as follows:

                                            e∗t = e∗t (−1) + e∗,t                                      (2.12)
   5
     This parameter corresponds to the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, that arises from
the Ramsey model applying a standard CRRA utility function for the representative household
   6
     Also, as arises from the Ramsey model applying a standard CRRA utility function for the representative
household

                                      yt∗ = 2yt∗ (−1) + yt∗ (−2) + y∗ ,t                                (2.14)

            The state equations above comprise the lowest order r -filter (r =1) to NAIRE
(2.12) and NAICU (2.13). In turn, an HP filter structure is set for potential output (2.14).7
Considering the measurement equations, the specification above introduces additional signals
through the employment rate (3.9) and capacity utilization (2.16) dynamics. The long-run
verticality is imposed in the Phillips curve (2.18), that includes the output gap (yt − yt∗ )
as another control. Finally, the measurement equation given by equation 2.11 is included
(2.17), where the parameter γ is set to 0.6.

(2004) model, built over Brazilian data. Using as reference Areosa (2008), we introduce
more structure in the potential output state equation. This procedure results in a state
space representation that allow us to make a join estimation of four latent economic variables:
NRIR, potential output, NAIRU and NAICU. First, we depart from the same state equations

                                             e∗t = e∗t (−1) + e∗,t                                        (3.1)
                                             c∗t = c∗t (−1) + c∗,t                                        (3.2)
                                      yt∗ = 2yt∗ (−1) + yt∗ (−2) + y∗ ,t                                  (3.3)
           Considering the measurement equations, we modify the Phillips curve specifica-
tion. Our dependent variable is the freely-set consumer inflation. Also, in the set of controls,
we add a variable related to external prices.8 Then, we have the following set of equations:

                                                et = e∗t + e,t                                            (3.4)
                                                ct = c∗t + c,t                                            (3.5)

      As Areosa (2008) mentions, the r -filters is a two-parameters family of filters in which the HP filter is
considered as the second order member (r =2). The r =1 filter converges to a constant, been more indicated
for stationary variables. As the order increases, the r -filter converges to higher order polynomial time trends.

      This Phillips curve specification follows closely BCB (2015).

             In this setting, ht is the output gap, given by the output deviation from its
potential. πtF is the freely-set consumer inflation. πt∗ is the imported goods inflation. Et (πt+1 )
is the inflation expectation. πt is the head consumer inflation. rt is the RIR. π,t is an error
term (i.i.d. ∼ N(0,σi2 ), for i=π. The long-run verticality of the Phillips curve is imposed
in equation 3.7. Besides, these two equations are consistent with the hypothesis that price
stability is reached when the RIR and the output are equal to their respective long term
equilibrium (NRIR and potential output).
             As we can observe in equation 3.7, these changes demand an adjustment in the
restriction that stem from the long term verticality. The next step is to make the link between
the NRIR and the potential output. Using as reference Mésonnier and Renne (2004), this
relationship is denoted by the following state equation:

                                          rt∗ = µr + φ(yt∗ − yt−4
                                                              ∗

          Equation 3.8 is a modified version of equation 2.7 in Mésonnier and Renne (2004),
where we replace the trend growth rate (gt ) by the potential output growth (year over year).
The remaining equations are signals from an r-filter for the RIR and an IS curve:

                                                rt = rt∗ + r,t                                           (3.9)

            h∗t is the world output gap. govt is the growth rate of the government expenditure
in real terms. rt is the RIR. h,t is an error term (i.i.d. ∼ N(0,σi2 ), for i=h. The remaining
variables were defined before.
            Also, similar to Areosa (2008), we introduce linear restrictions in the errors stan-
dard deviation of some transition √ and measurement √  equations (σ  ) that shares the same state
component, as follows: (1) σet = λe σe∗t ; (2) σct = λc σc∗t ; and (3) λc = λr = 40.9


4       Data description
            Our data was collected for Brazilian economy from the first quarter of 2002 to
fourth quarter of 2016, totalling 60 observations. On one hand, this sample interval ex-
cludes structural breaks as happened with the implementation of the real plan in 1994 and
the change of the exchange rate regime in 1999. One another hand, the period comprises
structural changes undergone by the economy after the Real plan and the last decade com-
modities’ boom. As Ubiergo (2012) highlights, the adoption of an inflation-targeting regime
and better economic fundamentals has helped Brazil sustain significantly lower real inter-
est rates than in the past. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, prices pressures
that stemmed from overstimulus policies triggered an monetary tightening cycle that lasted
almost four years (2013Q1-2016Q3). More recently, the combination of a severe recession

and inflation deceleration opened room for Central Bank to begin an interest rate reduction
cycle. All these events characterized the general economic background behind the policy
rate fluctuations over the last years in Brazil, that can be observed in Figure 1.

           We use as nominal interest rate the quarterly average of Selic rate in annual
terms. We also introduce the 12 months ahead inflation expectation from Focus, both
to calculate our RIR and to add as a control in the Phillips Curve. The other domestic
price measures applied in our framework was the head and the freely-set quarterly inflation
(Broad National Consumer Price Index -IPCA). The CRB commodity price index growth
in domestic currency is applied as the measure for external price inflation. The output
measure is the Brazilian GDP, obtained in National Accounts. The unemployment rate was
constructed exploring data from PNAD (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicı́lios) and
PME (Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego). Capacity utilization is provided by FGV (Fundação
Getulio Vargas). The external output was calculated through the aggregation of the GDPs
from Brazil’s thirteen largest export destinations. The nominal exchange rate is quarterly
average of the PTAX reference rate. The fiscal instance is captured by the recurring general
government outlays in real terms, calculated as Oreng (2012). When necessary, the variables
were seasonally adjusted using the X12 process.

5.1    Result and evaluation of the State-Space Macroeconomic Model
           Applying the state space model described in section three on our data, we ob-

tained paths for NRIR, potential output, NAIRU and NAICU in Brazil. Table 1 stands the
estimated parameters out. Using as reference national accounts data from Brazil, the output
elasticity of labor (γ) was set at 0.6.10 Also, we assumed a logarithmic utility function for
the representative household, setting the constant relative risk aversion (φ) equal to 1.11
             The latent variables dynamics is presented in Figure 2. For comparison, we also
produce the latent variables estimated by the HP filter. Table 2 and 3 shows the descriptive
statistics for each long-term variable.

     Analogously to one of the methods proposed by Gollin (2002), we calculated γ as the average for the
period 2010-2014 of the following ratio: (employee compensation+operating surplus of private unincorpo-
rated enterprises)/(employee compensation+operating surplus of private unincorporated enterprises+gross
operating surplus). The data is provided by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE (2016)).
Considering Brazilian data, a similar approach was adopted by Bastos (2012).
  11
     Arguing that φ is not well identified in the data, Holston et al. (2016) chose to impose this coefficient
equal to unity. The assumption behind this strategy is that we have a logarithmic utility function for the
representative household. See Hamilton et al. (2016) and Laubach and Williams (2016) for further details.

            We can observe that for all variables, the State Space Model has standard devi-
ation smaller than the original HP filter. Another point to emphasize is that the former is
more robust to the trend estimates bias usually presented by the latter method at the end
and beginning of samples.
            Evaluating the NRIR dynamics, as we can observe in the Figure 2, the minimum
NRIR value on the sample (1.3%) was registered in 2016Q1, reflecting the impact of the
potential GDP contraction in that moment. Considering this variable and period, we also
emphasize the difference between the NRIR estimated by the models (530 basis points),
a result that exemplifies the sizeable error that we can incur in the measurement of this
variable in periods marked by greater potential GDP variations. Analysing the remaining
non observable variables, we highlight the growing idle productive capacity stemming from
the recent recession, associated to both capital and labor factors.

            Assessing the remaining latent variables, the output gap measured by the State
Space Model is smother than the one obtained with the HP filter. This effect is specially
evident in the 2008 financial crisis. Considering the NAIRU and the NAICU, we highlight
the differences in these variables levels estimated by both models between 2008 and 2013.
This period coincides with a RIR holding sistematically under the NRIR in the state space
model, resulting in a NAIRU over and NAICU under the respective HP filter measures.

5.2    Evaluating the Monetary Policy Stance in Brazil through the
       lens of a State-Space Macroeconomic Model
           In this section we evaluate the stance of monetary policy in Brazil in our sample
period. First, we compare the RIR gap (the difference between the RIR and the NRIR) with
some price and activity variables explored in our Kalman Filter. Second, we identify the

                                            12
monetary policy easing and tightening cycles using the latent variables dynamics. Figure 3
allows a comparison of the RIR gap with: inflation, output gap, unemployment rate gap and
capacity utilization gap.




 Figure 3: Evaluating the stance of monetary policy: RIR gap vs business cycle variables

           As we can observe, the comovement among the variables occurs as expected.
When the RIR is set under (above) the NRIR, we usually identify inflation above (under)
the central target, the output above (under) its potential, the unemployment rate under
(above) the NAIRU and the installed capacity utilization above (under) the NAICU.
           In order to assess the monetary policy stance, we verify the RIR gap dynamics
during our sample period. Periods of negative (positive) RIR gap are identified by the
shaded (white) areas in the graphs, being equivalent to monetary easing (tightening) cycles.
A more restrictive monetary policy prevails in the first half of our sample. The last (and
longest) period of policy easing was 2009Q3-2014Q2. Since then, Brazil Central Bank has
been adopting a tighter monetary stance.

6      Final Remarks
            In this study, we employ a multivariate Kalman Filter to measure the Neutral
Real Interest Rate (NRIR) in Brazil, from 2002Q1 to 2016Q4. Basically, we depart from
Mésonnier and Renne (2004) and Areosa (2008) state space models in order to build a
representation that allow us to make a join estimation of four latent economic variables:
NRIR, potential output, NAIRU and NAICU. This method differs from previous literature
in two ways. First, former studies usually make a joint estimation of two latent variables:
NRIR and potential output. Second, instead of imposing for potential output structures
that follow random walks or have autoregressive patterns, our state space model relies on
the production function approach.
            Comparing the latent variables estimated by our state space macroeconomic
model with the ones that results from a HP filter, the former is more robust to the trend
estimates bias usually presented by the latter method at the end and beginning of samples.
Also, the difference between the NRIR estimated by the models at some moments exemplifies
the sizeable error that we can incur in the measurement of this variable in periods marked
by greater potential GDP variations. Analysing the remaining non observable variables, we
highlight the growing idle productive capacity linked to both capital and labor factors.
            Evaluating the monetary policy stance in our sample period with the state space
macroeconomic model, we observed that in the first half of our data, tighter monetary
policy prevailed. The last (and longest) period of policy easing began in the aftermath of
2008 financial crisis and sustained till the first half of 2014. Since then, Brazil Central Bank
has been adopting a tighter monetary stance.
