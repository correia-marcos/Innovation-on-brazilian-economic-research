ABSTRACT
There are a number of different types of social tensions that can generate social unrest. Starting
from standard inequality and poverty concerns to the ones related to temporal fluctuations in living
standards including both systemic and idiosyncratic sources of risk. These social tensions may also
include social groups immobility, polarization and middle class related considerations. This paper
provides a common methodology to model different sources of social tensions and applies it to the
recent Brazilian experience.
In all cases, we start from explicit normative values to each particular social tension, paying special
attention to specifying their respective social welfare functions as in Atkinson (1970). This approach
allows rigorous treatment to the consequences of normative values initially assumed in different
dimensions. For example, we demonstrate for an entire class of social tensions associated with
poverty that they will always decrease when there is a positive inequality neutral growth rate. Thus
inequality neutral growth reduces poverty tensions but by definition has no impact on inequality
tension.
While a social welfare function based approach is well established in the inequality and to a less
extend in the poverty literatures, other elements are not equally developed. In particular, a social
welfare function based approach has not been attempted to polarization and associated middle
class issues. This is a particular innovation proposed in this paper. We also address social tensions
related to macroeconomic volatility and relative social immobility.
The overall contribution of the paper is to model and measure, side by side, different sources of
social tension and to discuss their interrelations found in practice. We calculate various social
tensions levels and trends in Brazil from 1992 to 2012 using microdata from national household
surveys. The recent Brazilian experience turns out to be an interesting case of study because it
combines improvements in stability, equity and growth of household incomes whose influences on
society climate should be sorted out. First across the last two decades there was increasing stability
for individual and aggregate income fluctuations. On top of that, there was in the last decade the
resumption of growth, especially in household incomes with increasing income equality both
between individuals and socio-economic groups. As a result the relationship between these
primitive causes behind social welfare improvement and other by products such as poverty
emancipation and the rise of an emerging middle class can be better understood.

    1. Introduction
This paper has two objectives. First it provides a common methodology to measure different social
tensions that can exist in a society due to many reasons. Secondly it analyzes sources of social tension and
their trends in Brazil from 1992-2012. Various dimensions of social tensions have been considered in our
theoretical and empirical analysis, namely: 1. High inequality; 2.Existence of poverty; 3. Diminishing
middle class and increased polarization; 4. Growth volatility; 5. Social immobility
The measurement of each social concern requires specific normative judgments, which are made explicit
in a social welfare function. Although the paper provides a general framework of social welfare function,
since the main objective of this paper is to measure social tensions in Brazil, the social welfare functions
considered are those which can be estimated from Brazilian household surveys.
Many social welfare functions have been proposed in the literature. The main purpose of social welfare
functions is to evaluate economic allocations to know what policies are working and what are not
working. The different policies affect individuals differently; from any public policy perspective some
individuals will lose and others will gain. So in any evaluation, the normative judgment cannot be
avoided. The social welfare functions explicitly specify the normative judgment about the weights given
to different individuals.
The main object of this paper is to apply social welfare functions to measure different social tensions
which can arise due to many reasons. These tensions are social concerns, which can become a source of
social upheaval. This paper attempts to embody these various social concerns in a social welfare function
framework.
The paper is organized as following. Section 2 provides a general description of the social welfare
function approach that will be applied to each dimension addressed here. From section 3 to section 7 we
study each source of social tension one at the time: inequality, poverty, polarization, aggregate growth
volatility and social mobility. Section 8 gauges each of these social tensions for Brazil covering the period
from 1992 to 2012 using the nationwide survey called in short PNAD1. Per capita real household income
is used as individuals’ welfare measure. The last section provides the main conclusions of the paper.


    2. A general description of social welfare function
Social welfare depends on both mean income and its distribution. The mean income is generated in the
society through the output that is produced in the economy. This output is generally measured by gross
domestic product. It is the mal-distribution of income that provides the measures of social tension. There
may be trade-off between mean income and social tension, which in economic literature is described as an
equity/efficiency trade-off.
Social tension in any dimension is measured by the proportional loss of social welfare caused due to the
existence of social tension. The level of social welfare can be evaluated by   = (1 − ) (1)

where is the mean income of the society and T is a measure of social tension. A growth process may be
described as inclusive if the percentage increase in mean income exceeds the percentage fall in (1-T) or in
other words if net social welfare increases. Inclusive growth is viewed as a multidimensional concept
because it takes into account different dimensions of social tension.

 PNAD stands for Pesquisa Nacional por Amostras de Domicílios which is an annual household survey and has
been conducted by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística - IBGE. During the 20 year period covered
here PNAD questionnaire did not change.
                                                         2
No attempt has been made in the paper to combine different dimensions of social tension into an overall
measure of social tension. Since different dimensions are based on different normative judgments it
makes little sense to combine them into a single index. Each dimension is analyzed individually in order
to identify which source of social tension has an increasing or decreasing trend over time. An increasing
social tension can become a source of much social unrest so it is imperative to measure trends in
individual social tensions.
The trends in social tension can be analyzed by the following decomposition derived from (1):
∆ ( ) = ∆ ( ) + ∆ (1 − )                                                 (2)
which shows that growth rate of social welfare is sum of the growth rates of mean income and (1-T). The
growth rate of (1-T) denoted by = ∆ (1 − ) informs whether social tension is increasing or
decreasing overt time. The negative value of implies increasing social tension while the positive value
implies decreasing social tension. Or in other words the gain in growth rate of social welfare signifies
decreasing social tension and loss in growth rate signifies increasing social tension. If, hypothetically
social tension T were to decrease from 60 percent to 50 percent, a gain in growth rate of 22.3 percent will
be realized.
A social welfare function is like a rule that provides a way to aggregate different utilities enjoyed by
individuals in the society. Suppose there are n individuals in the society who have income distribution
denoted by ≈ [ , , − − − − − − ]

then one can construct utility functions, ( ) that summarizes the individuals’ value judgments: A
person i prefers to if and only if ( ) > ( ). The social welfare function is then defined as a
function of individual utilities: ( ) = [ ( ), ( ), − − − − −−, ( )]
One of the reasonable restriction on this general social welfare function is that it is an increasing function
in each individuals’ utility, that way it is ensured that if everyone prefers to , society will also prefer
to .
One of the most used approach of aggregating the individual utilities is the utilitarian approach, which
defines social welfare as the sum of individual utilities: ( ) = ∑        ( )
This is referred to as Benthamite welfare function. A slight generalization of this function is the weighted
utility function: ( ) = ∑          ( )

where the weights attached to the individual utility adds to 1, i.e. ∑      = 1. These weights inform how
much importance is attached to different individuals’ utility in the social welfare function.
 In the social welfare function defined above, the individual preferences are defined over the entire
distribution rather than over each individual’s bundle of consumption or income. One possible
judgment is that individuals care only about their own consumption and are not concerned about what
others are consuming. In this case utility of individual i is denoted by ( ), then the social welfare will
have the form:     = [ ( ), ( ), − − − − − − −, ( )]
This social welfare function is a function of the individuals’ utility and is called individualistic social
welfare function. The function is popularly known as Bergson-Samuelson’s welfare function.
This section has discussed general forms of social welfare functions. The next section discusses a specific
relationship between income inequality measured by the Gini index and social welfare function. Per
capita real income is defined as per capita nominal income adjusted for prices.

    3. Gini social welfare function
The Gini social welfare function proposed by Sen (1974) can be derived using the idea that individuals
suffer loss of welfare when they find that their income is lower than others. An individual with income x
compares his income with all other individuals in the society. He selects other individuals one by one and
makes all possible comparisons. Suppose he selects an individual with income y and feels deprived upon
discovering his income x is lower than income y and therefore suffers loss of welfare. He suffers no loss
of welfare if higher the compared income. His welfare is then given by Kakwani (1986): ( , ) =
   ! ≥ ;               = −( − ) ! <

Suppose the income x of an individual is a continuous random variable with mean and probability
density function f(x), then in all pair wise comparisons his expected welfare is obtained denoted by u(x)
  ( ) = − [1 − $ ( )] + [1 − $( )]                   (3) where F(x) is the distribution function which is
interpreted as the proportion of population with income less than x and F1(x) defined as $ ( ) =
   ∞
  & '!(')(' is the proportion of income enjoyed by individuals with income less than or equal to x.
% )

Differentiating (3) twice gives: ′ ( ) = 2 − $( ); ′′ ( ) = −!( ) which implies that the individual
(expected) welfare is an increasing function of income and is concave. This is the basic requirement of
any utility function.
                                                                         ∞
The average welfare of the society is then obtained from (3) as + = &) ( )!( )( =
   ∞
2 &) [1 − $( )]!( )( = (1 − ,) (4) where G is the Gini index and (1 − ,) is the Gini social
welfare function proposed by Sen in 1974.
 It is noted from (4) that the Gini social welfare function is the weighted average of incomes of all
individuals with weight v(x) given by -( ) = 2[1 − $( )] where the total weight adds to 1. It should be
understood that the weight v(x) has been defined as a function of the whole distribution and not of xi
alone, which implies a more general social welfare function than the one that is additive separable. An
additive social welfare function is obtained by adding up the individual welfare components which are
independent of welfare (income) of others. This social welfare function captures the relative deprivation
by making the weights v(x) depend on the ranking of all individuals. The lower a person is in rank, the
greater the sense of deprivation with respect to others in the society. The deprivation suffered by an
individual with income x is proportional to the number of persons who are richer than her.
The average deprivation suffered by the society is the Gini index which is the proportional loss of social
welfare. Thus the Gini index is a measure of social tension caused due to the existence of inequality in the
society. Atkinson’s (1970) class of inequalities can also provide alternative measures of tensions due to
inequality in the society. But in the analysis of social tension in Brazil, only the Gini social welfare
function has been utilized.


    4. Social tension due to existence of poverty
Poverty is viewed as income (or consumption) deprivation. A poverty situation emerges when some
sections of a society have so little that they cannot meet their minimum basic needs as defined by the
poverty line. The phenomenon of poverty has become a major source of social tension. Some economists
have even suggested that poverty can trigger social unrest and ultimately the kind of sustained violence
that reduces growth (Lustig, Arias and Rigolini, 2002).
As discussed in the previous section, inequality creates social tension which can be measured by the loss
of social welfare. The relationship between inequality and social welfare has been widely discussed in the
literature. Every inequality measure has an implicit social welfare function. But no such relationship has
                                                     4
been established between various poverty measures and social welfare functions. This section derives
social welfare functions corresponding to the class of Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (1984) measures
which will be referred to as FGT measures.
It is assumed that the poor individuals suffer deprivation when they find that their income is less than the
poverty line. The poverty line specifies the society’s minimum standard of living. An individual suffers
deprivation which results in loss of welfare when his income is less than the poverty line. The welfare of
an individual with income x is given by .( ) = − /(0, ) ! < 0 (5); =                            ! ≥0
where z is the poverty line and /(0, ) > 0 ! < 0; = 0 ! ≥ 0 is the deprivation function
suffered by the poor. The non-poor do not suffer any deprivation. Given (5), the average welfare of the
                                2
society is given by     = − &) /(0, )!( )( (6) where is the mean income of the society. The
second term in the right hand side (6) is the social deprivation due to the existence of poverty. The social
deprivation needs to be measured in money metric so that the society knows how much average income is
lost due to the existence of poverty or in other words social deprivation should be invariant to a positive
transformation of the deprivation function. Clark, Hemming and Ulph (1981) introduced the idea of
“equally distributed equivalent poverty gap” which denoting by /̅ is specified as /̅ 4 =
    2

  &) (0 − )4 !( )( (7) where H is the headcount measure of poverty.
                                                       2
The social deprivation from (7) is then given &) /(0, )!( )( = 6/̅                         (8)
                                                                                       9
                                                                                   7
Substituting (7) and (8) into (6) gives the social welfare as        4   =   − 60( 58 )8 (9) where :4 is the FGT
                                                    2 2;<
class of poverty measures defined as :4 =          &) ( 2 )4 !(   )(       where :4 = H, the headcount ratio
when = = 0; = the poverty gap ratio when = = 1;                 = the severity of poverty ratio when = = 2
The headcount ratio as Sen (1976) calls it is a crude measure of poverty because it is completely
insensitive to depth and severity of poverty. The poverty gap ratio on the other hand takes into account
the depth of poverty which is measured by the average income gap of the poor from the poverty line and
the severity of poverty in addition takes account of inequality of income among the poor. Note that 4 is
not defined for the headcount ratio when = = 0.

 4 in (9) shows that like any inequality measure there is an implicit social welfare function for each
member of the FGT class of poverty measures (except for the headcount ratio). The proportional loss of
                                                                                       (8?9)       9
                                                                                    25 8 (78 )8
social welfare due to the existence of poverty is obtained from (8) as >4 =                 %
                                                                                                         (10) which is the
proposed measure of social tension caused due to the existence of poverty. The measure of social tension
                                                                       27
for poverty gap ratio is obtained by substituting = = 1 in (10) as > = %9 (11) where : is the
poverty gap ratio. Differentiating (11) with respect to while keeping inequality (measured by the Lorenz
                       @A
curve) constant gives @%9 = −60 < 0 which demonstrates that social tension implied by poverty gap
ratio always decreases when there is inequality neutral economic growth. Similarly social tension
                                                                                                 2B57C
measure for severity of poverty is obtained by substituting = = 2 in (10) as > =                          (12) where :
                                                                                                   %
is the severity of poverty ratio. Differentiating (12) with respect to        while keeping inequality constant
gives:
@AC        2[2D(2)7C E 5(79 E7C )]
      =−                             < 0 which demonstrates that social tension implied by severity of poverty
@%                 % C B57C
ratio also decreases when there is inequality neutral economic growth. Similarly it can be demonstrated
that the entire class of social tension measures will always decreases when there is inequality neutral
growth rate. Note that inequality neutral growth does not change the relative social tension measures

caused due to inequality in the society such as the Gini index. Thus inequality neutral growth reduces the
poverty tension but has no impact on inequality tension.
An inequality neutral growth increases the incomes of all individuals when the relative distribution
defined by the Lorenz curve does not change. When growth is not inequality neutral, then the following
four scenarios are possible:
   1.   Inequality tension increases but poverty tension decreases.
   2.   Both inequality and poverty tensions increase.
   3.   Both inequality and poverty tensions decrease.
   4.   Inequality tension decreases but poverty tension increases.
Ideally the society should aim at reducing both inequality and poverty tensions but such a scenario is not
very common in developing countries. Recently, as discussed below, Brazil has achieved reduction in
both inequality and poverty tensions (scenario 3). But scenario 1, whereby increase in inequality tension
is accompanies by reduction in poverty tension is most widely observed in the developing world
particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This phenomenon is strongly prevalent in China where inequality
has been increasing but at the same time poverty has been reducing sharply. These observations have led
to a belief that developing countries face a tradeoff between inequality and poverty. Based on cross-
country evidence Ravallion (2005) did not find any systematic tradeoff between measures of poverty and
relative inequality.
The growth process endogenously determines both inequality and poverty tensions. The two kinds of
social tensions may conflict in some cases and may not in other cases. They imply different social welfare
functions and therefore have different social objectives both of which have intrinsic value to the society.
The estimation of the two social tensions, however, is important to judge alternative policies.


    5. Social tension and polarization
 Recently, there has been a growing literature on the role of middle class in economic development. An
emerging consensus among economists is that an increase in the size of the middle class leads to rise in
per capita income and that increase in the middle income shares causes a rise in the growth rate (Easterly,
2001). In addition, a greater income share of the middle class leads to better health and education
outcomes. Birdsall (2007) even defined inclusive growth as growth which builds middle class. According
to her, a small and weak middle class implies weak state institutions and hence unsustainable growth.
Berkowitz and Jackson (2005) pointed out that a powerful middle class is conducive to lower inequality.
The phenomenon of “disappearing middle class” has become a concern among many economists
(Wolfson 1994). The disappearing of middle class has occurred because the society is becoming more
polarized. Foster and Wolfson (1992) introduced the idea of bi-polarization that is directly linked to the
disappearing of the middle class. A society is said to be polarized when it is divided into groups, with
substantial intra group homogeneity and intergroup heterogeneity. Based on this definition, Esteban and
Ray (1994) identified two distinct notions of polarization. The first is the alienation, which measures how
far apart are different groups and the second is the identification, which measures how closely the
members of a group are aligned with each other sharing common aspirations and values. The existence of
such groups have potential for social conflicts.
Suppose a society is divided into three groups: the poor, middle class and the rich. Then the shrinking of
the middle class and an increasing gap between the poor and the rich implies increasing polarization in
the society. A polarized society has small middle class and sizable poor and rich classes with large
income gap between them. This is basically the idea of bi-polarization as articulated by Foster and
Wolfson (1992 and 2009).

                                                     6
The concept of polarization is directly linked to social tension. As has been argued in this paper, social
tension can be measured by the loss of social welfare if one can find a social welfare function that
embodies the essential elements of social tension caused due to polarization. This section derives such a
social welfare function. A link between social welfare and polarization has not been discussed in the
literature.
The notion of alienation is measured by the degree of spread from the middle position (median) to the
tails of the income distribution. The larger spread from the median implies smaller middle class and larger
polarization, which is the case where the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. This causes
social tension. The social welfare function that incorporates the idea of alienation is derived as following.
A person is assumed to be alienated if his or her income spreads from the middle. Suppose m is the
median income, then her alienation is given by the difference of the individual income from the median.
The utility that takes account of the alienation from the median may be defined as:

    u(x) = x - ( I -x) if x<< I                                                               (13)
    = x – (x – m) if x >>m
                                                                            (P ;P )
So the average welfare of the society from (13) is obtained as O = − C 9                   (14) where m1
and m2 are the mean incomes of the population having income below and above the median income,
respectively. WA is the social welfare that takes into account alienation in the society. The proportional
                                                          (P ;P )
loss of social welfare due to alienation is given by Q = C % 9 (15)

The larger the A the greater is the alienation in the society. A is the proposed measure of social alienation.
The second aspect of bi-polarization refers to the case where incomes below the median or above the
median become closer to each other. Nissanov, Poggi and Silber (2011) called this situation as a
“bunching of the two groups in the sense that the gaps between the income below the median (or above
the median) have been reduced”. The polarization increases when the two groups become homogeneous.
The social welfare function in (14) gives equal weights to the income gaps from the median, which is the
reason that it is completely insensitive to any transfer of income on either side of the median. To make it
sensitive to such transfers, different weights need to be given to different income gaps. How should then
weights be determined?
Suppose v(x) is the weight give to x. Since the society is most concerned with the welfare of middle
income, the weight v(x) should be maximum at the median when x=m, which tappers off to 0 at the tails
of the distribution. This means that v(x) should be an increasing function of x until it reaches the
maximum value at x=m and then it should be decreasing with x until becomes 0 as income reaches
infinity. A simple weighting scheme proposed is as follows: -( ) = 4$( ) ! < I (16)                  ;
                                                                               S

 Using (13) and (16) the average welfare of the society is then obtained as T = &) ( )-( )!( )( =
   − (I − I ) + 2 , (17) which is the social welfare that takes account of polarization in the society.
The proportional loss of social welfare due to polarization is given by U = 2(Q − ,) (18) where A is the
measure of social alienation derived in (15) and G is the Gini index. B is a measure of social tension
caused due to polarization in the society. This measure can also be written as U = 2(,T − ,V ) where GB
and GW are the between and within group inequalities when the two groups are formed of the populations
having income less and greater than the median income, respectively. The polarization measure B in (18)
is similar to the measure proposed by Foster and Wolfson (1992). This is a measure of social tension due
to the existence of polarization in the society.

       6. Growth volatility and social tension
Growth rates inform whether and to what extent people are becoming better or worse off over time. Not
surprisingly, therefore, magnitudes of growth rates are always the focus of attention when economists
discuss alternative strategies of economic development. In practice there is large volatility in growth
rates. They can fluctuate widely from negatives to positives. This volatility can create social tension
particularly when people’s standard of living is falling. The fluctuating growth rates create uncertainty
among economic agents about their business decisions as to when they should make investments, or when
they should hire and fire workers. The policy making becomes difficult for the government under the
regime of volatile growth. The poor also suffer because they feel insecure when their incomes are widely
fluctuating.
The volatility in growth rates is viewed here as causing social tension. This section develops a model to
measure the loss of social welfare attributed entirely due to volatility in growth rates.

Suppose W is the per capita income of the society in period t and there are n time periods, then a simple
inter temporal social welfare function may be defined as     ( ∗ ) = ∑W         ( W ) (19)
         ∗
where is the money metric social welfare for the entire n periods. Let rt be the growth rate of per capita
income in the year between t-1 and t, then definition W = W; (1 + YW ) must hold. Substituting
sequentially W in terms of gives W = (1 + Y )(1 + YZ ) − − − −(1 + YW )

which on taking on logarithm of both sides gives        ( W) =     ( ) + ∑W\   [ ( 1 + Y\ )
                                                              ;
which on substituting in (19) gives           ( ∗) =   ( )+       ∑W   .W   (1 + YW ) (20) where .W =
    ( ;WE )
     ( ; )

Such that ∑W .W = 1, which provides the relationship between the aggregate welfare level measured by
 ∗
   and the growth rates.2
It is reasonable to assume that when all growth rates are equal, there is no volatility in growth in which
case social welfare must be maximum so the loss of social welfare from the maximum provides a welfare
measure of growth volatility. To measure the impact of volatility on social welfare, a counter factual is
that all growth rates are equal to the average growth rate given by Y̅ = ∑W .W YW        (21)
                                                                   ∗                  ;
which on substituting in (20) gives a new welfare function      ( ]) = ( ) +                (1 + Y̅ ) (22)

Because of the concavity of logarithmic function, the following relationship will always hold:
∑W .W (1 + YW ) ≤ (∑W .W (1 + YW )) Which on using (21) immediately gives ∑W .W                        (1 +
YW ) ≤ (1 + Y̅ )
                                                                                              (   ∗
This equation holds for all values of growth rates rt. Comparing (20) and (22) leads to           ])   ≥
   ( ∗)
        ∗
Thus ]     is the maximum value of money metric social welfare when there is no growth volatility, i.e.
when all growth rates are equal. The loss of social welfare due to the volatility of growth rates is given by
        ∗
_=( ]      − ∗ ) (23) which is the proposed measure of social tension caused due to growth rate
volatility. It can easily be verified that V=0 when all growth rates are equal.

    7. Social mobility and social tension
Social mobility is the movement of individuals or groups in economic and social position. The groups
may refer to social classes such as the untouchable in India or ethnic and religious groups or even groups
based on income, gender, race and age. A society can be said to lack social mobility if some social groups
within it are unable to improve their social and economic status and are struck in low paid jobs even when
they work hard. Social barriers generally contribute to immobility in the society.
There is a strong correlation between obtaining an education and increasing one’s economic mobility.
Despite the increasing availability of education for all, family background continues to play a huge role in
determining one’s economic success.
There is now a sizable literature on the measurement of income mobility. The measurement of income
mobility in this literature is viewed as an extension of measurement of inequality over time. The
pioneering work in this area is that of Shorrocks (1978) who developed a mobility index that informs to
what extent the relative income of individuals have remained static or changed over time. The larger is
the change in relative incomes over time the greater is the income mobility.
If the ranking of individuals by their incomes change in two periods, then this situation is also
characterized as achieving income mobility. On the other side, if the ranking of individuals does not
change in two periods, then there is no mobility in the society. King (1983) constructed an index which
measures changes in the rank orders in the income distribution over time. Fields and Ok (1996, 1999a,
1999b) and Mitra and Ok (1998) viewed mobility in terms of distance between income distributions in
two time periods. The measures of mobility proposed in the literature are largely based on the distance
between income distributions between different periods. These measures can only be measured from the
panel data of the same households, which are seldom available.
In all these studies, mobility is measured by the degree of volatility in individuals’ incomes over time; the
larger the volatility, the greater the mobility, which may itself contribute to an undesirable source of
anxiety in the society. It has been argued in the previous section that volatility in growth causes social
tension which results in a lower level of social welfare across time. This view makes the measurement of
income mobility not very useful.
In this paper, social mobility is analyzed in terms of relative movement of social groups in their economic
status. If the economic status of worse off social groups is improving at a faster rate than better off social
groups, then the society may be defined as socially mobile. A society lacks social mobility if the worse
off social groups are never able to improve their relative economic situation, which could be due to their
family circumstances or other social barriers. This lack of social mobility is viewed here as causing social
tension. The following methodology is proposed to measure such social tension.
Suppose a population is divided into k mutually exclusive social groups and ai is the population share of
the ith group, then ∑`      = 1 must hold. Further, if ! ( ) is the density function of the ith group, then the
                                                                             S
average social welfare enjoyed by the ith group will be given by         = &) ( )! ( )( (24) where u(x)
has been defined in (3) and + = (1 − ,) where G being the Gini index is the average welfare enjoyed
by the whole society. The average welfare enjoyed by any group can then be compared with the average
welfare enjoyed by the whole society. This will inform which group is enjoying more (or less) welfare
than the whole society. It can be easily shown that !( ) = ∑`          ! ( ) (25) where f(x) is the density
function of the entire population. Now substituting (25) into (3) and using (24) gives + = ∑`
(26) which demonstrates that the social welfare enjoyed by the whole society is the weighted average of
the welfare enjoyed by each social group, where the weights is the population share of the social group.
100 ×         is the percentage contribution of the ith social group to the total social welfare of the society.

The mobility of the society is determined to what extent socially worse off groups progress in relation to
the whole society. The gap in economic status of different groups can be measured by the relative mean
deviation: bcd =        ∑`      | − +|                                             (27)
                        Ve

The RMD is equal to 0 if all groups enjoy exactly the same welfare and equal to 1 if all groups except one
have welfare equal to 0 and only one group enjoys all the welfare. It is possible that the relative welfare of
some groups is negative because the average income earned by the group is less than the average
deprivation suffered in which case the RMD can exceed 1. The negative welfare of a group implies that
the group is extremely worse off in the society.
The society is defined to be mobile if the worse off groups improve their welfare more than the better off
groups or in other words gap in economic status measured by social welfare decreases over time. The
degree of mobility may be measured by the rate at which the RMD is declining over time. The increase in
RMD over time implies that the worse of groups are relatively becoming even more worse off. An
immobile society is the one when the some groups are never able to improve their economic status
relative to whole society. Such situation causes social tension.


     8. Empirical analysis of social tension in Brazil
The analysis presented in this section is based on Brazilian National Household Survey called PNAD for
the 2001-2012 period. The survey has extensive information on personal and occupational characteristics
of households and individuals. Per capita real household income is used as individuals’ welfare measure3.
The rich information provided by the survey allows for calculating various dimensions of social tensions
and their trend. The trends are calculated for three periods: 1992-2001, 2001-2012 and 1992-2012.
8.1 Social tension due to inequality - The debate on inequality in Brazil mainly revolves around the Gini
index, which is the most widely used inequality measure. This is the main reason that social tension due
to inequality in this paper is measured based on the Gini social welfare function. As discussed the Gini
index is the relative measure of social tension.
Table 1 presents the estimates of social welfare, which is the per capita real income adjusted for the social
tension caused by inequality as measured by the Gini index. The table does not give the values of social
welfare for 2000 and 2010 because PNAD was not conducted during these census years. Although 1994
was not a census year, still no survey results were available for this year. In the estimation of trends,
however, appropriate adjustments were done for the missing values for 1994, 2000 and 2010.
Let us first look at the entire period 1992-2012. The real per capita household income has been increasing
at an annual rate of 2.13% while the social welfare has been increasing at higher rate of 3.04%, which
implies that there is a gain in growth rate of 0.91% per annum in social welfare. This is happening
because the Gini index has been decreasing at an annual rate 0.69%. Thus a decline in the Gini index of
1% leads to gain of 1.32% in growth rate of social welfare. Thus a fall in inequality results in a substantial
gain in social welfare.
Depicting the trend in inequality shows that sustained decline in inequality occurred between 2001 and
2012. During this period the social welfare increased at an annual rate of 5.12% while the per capita real
income increased at an annual rate of 3.65%, which implies a gain in annual growth rate of 1.47% in
social welfare. This has occurred because the Gini index has been decreasing at an annual rate of 1.16%.

 Per capita real income is defined as per capita nominal income adjusted for prices. The adjustment for prices is done by the
consumer price index corresponding to the PNAD survey periods.

Thus there has been a sharp decline in inequality in Brazil, which has led to a sharp increase in growth
rate of social welfare. After decades of increasing or stagnated high inequality in Brazil, tides are turning
as inequality has begun declining sharply since 2001.

The increase (decrease) in social tension leads to loss (gain) in growth of social welfare. The gain in
growth rate does not occur every year between 1992 and 2001 but however occurs every year between
2001 and 2012, although the gain has slowed down in the later years since 2008. The trend growth rate
for the period 2001-2012 is equal to 1.47% per annum. The overall conclusion emerging is that in the new
millennium growth process in Brazil has benefited the lower income groups more than the upper income
groups resulting in consistently declining social tension due to inequality.
8.2 Social tension due to existence of poverty - Poverty estimates for the headcount ratio, the poverty
gap ratio and the severity of poverty are presented in Table 2. The estimates are based on two poverty lines:
(1) extreme poverty line of 2005 PPP U$1.25 a day and (2) poverty line of 2005 PPP U$2.50 a day. All
poverty measures show that poverty in Brazil has been decreasing sharply but the rate of decline in poverty
has also increased sharply in the 2001-2012 period. Depicting the percentage of poor and extremely poor
shows that the rate of poverty decline accelerated in 2003 when Brazil introduced its CCT program called
Bolsa Família.
In the period 2001-2012 the percentage of extreme poor declined at an annual rate of 8.9%, while the
percentage of poor declined at a higher rate of 10.3% per annum, so the rate of poverty reduction among
the extreme poor is lower than that among the poor. Since the extreme poor suffer much greater
deprivation, the government policies should be more focused on reducing or even eliminating extreme
poverty.


                                                     11
It is generally the case that poverty gap and severity of poverty decline at a faster rate than the percentage
of poor. This is not happening in Brazil. What is the implication? In the period 2001-2012, the poverty
gap for extreme poor has been declining at an annual rate of 6.6% which means that income gap from the
poverty line for the extreme poor has been widening at an annual rate 2.3%. It can be concluded that the
extremely poor who were unable to cross the poverty line have suffered falls in their income. The poverty
alleviation programs in Brazil are not much helping those extremely poor who could not be lifted out of
poverty.

The social tension depends on what poverty measure is used. Table 3 presents the estimates of social
tension for both poverty gap ratio and severity of poverty. Social tension due to extreme poverty
decreased sharply between 1992 and 1995, then the rate of decline slowed down considerably until 2003
but accelerated sharply until 2012.
The social tension due to existence of poverty is much higher than that due to existence of extreme
poverty. This is expected because the society is now concerned about the larger group of individuals who
are suffering from poverty. Social tension due to the existence of poverty has been declining at a faster
rate.
The magnitude of social tension due to the existence of poverty is much smaller than that observed for
social tension due to inequality but the rate of decline is much sharper. For the period 2001-2012 the trend
rate of decline in social tension for severity of poverty is 10.79% while the decline for social tension due
to inequality is only 1.16%. A general conclusion is that the rate of decline of social tension due to
poverty is much sharper than that due to inequality.

8.2 Social tension due to alienation and polarization As discussed social tension due to alienation and
    polarization are closely related to the diminishing middle class. It is assumed that society is concerned
    with the diminishing middle class, which occurs because the society is polarized. The alienation is
    concerned with the spread of distribution from the median; the larger is this spread, the smaller the
    middle class. The polarization in addition is concerned with the degree of homogeneity of the social
    groups.
Brazil has been suffering from high degrees of alienation and polarization but the empirical results
presented in Table 4 show that both these sources of social tension have been increasing at annual rates of
0.06 and 0.03 percent respectively in the period 1992-2001. But in the subsequent period of 2001-2012
both social tensions due to alienation and polarization have been decreasing sharply at annual rates of
1.07 and 0.71 percent, respectively.
This study divides the Brazilian population into three mutually exclusive groups:

    (i)     the poor whose per capita income is less 50% of the median;
    (ii)    the middle class whose per capita income is above the 50% of the median and below the 150%
            of the median; and
    (iii)   the rich whose per capita income is above the 150% of the median.

In the determination of social classes, the median is used as the reference point. There is arbitrariness in
the definition of middle class. In the literature there is no consensus on what range around the median
should be used in defining middle class. The choice of range determines the size and share of the middle
                                                           13
class so any number of alternatives can be justified. This arbitrariness surely weakens the entire analysis
of middle class, which has become so much of focus in the economic literature.
The middle class definition used is given in (ii) and it has two components: (1) size of the middle class
and (2) income share of the middle class. Figures 6 and 7 show that there is an inverse relationship
between the size and income share of the middle class and alienation and polarization. In the period 1992-
2001 when both alienation and polarization have been increasing, the size and income share of the middle
class have been decreasing. But in the subsequent period of 2001-2012 when both alienation and
polarization have been declining, the size and income share of the middle class have been increasing at
annual rates of 1.40% and 3.53%, respectively. The share of middle class has been increasing at a much
faster rate than the size of the middle class. This means that in relative terms, per capita income of the
middle class is growing at a faster rate than the average income.
The alienation and polarization are closely related to middle class and can be measured without
specifying any range. To see the closeness of this relationship, the following regressions were fitted using
PNAD for the period 1992-2012:


Log (size middle class) = 9.1 - 1.25 Log (alienation)         R2=0.86
                       (29.6) (-10.1)
Log (share of middle class) = 16.9 - 3.2 Log (alienation)     R2=0.97
                             (28.5) (-23.3)
Log (size middle class) = 6.62 - 0.85 Log (polarization)      R2=0.43
                          (8.0) (-3.5)
Log (share of middle class) = 11.0 - 2.3 Log (polarization) R2=0.55
                              (6.1) (-4.4)

These results show that the relationship between size and income share of the middle class with alienation
is so strong that it may be possible to conclude that a decrease (increase) in alienation leads to an increase
(decrease) in the size and income share of the middle class. Although this relationship is established in
terms of the specific range of 50% to 150% of the median, simulations were performed with alternative
ranges around the median. The conclusions emerging were found to be robust for alternative ranges. Thus
one does not need to arbitrarily specify the range of the middle class in order to know whether middle
class is increasing or decreasing. This analysis does not exactly inform how much is the size and income
share of the middle class but it can tells whether the social concern due to diminishing middle class is
increasing or decreasing for all possible ranges around median.

8.3 Growth volatility and social tension The social tension due to volatility of growth is measured by
    the loss of social welfare in a temporal social welfare function. There are year to year differences in
    growth rates between PNAD per capita income and per capita GDP. It is noted in Figure 8 that per
    capita incomes from PNAD has more volatile growth rates than per capita GDP. Table 5 presents the
    growth rates of per capita GDP, household income and income of the bottom 40% population. The
    volatility index presented in the last three rows of Table 5 is calculated for the three periods: 1992-
    2001, 2001-2012 and 1992-2012. The following conclusions are summarized.
    1. The per capita GDP has lower volatility than the per capita household income.
    2. The bottom 40% of the population suffers higher volatility in per capita income than the whole
        population. This is an important observation revealing that the poor have not only lower incomes
        but also suffer from more volatile incomes.
    3. There is greater volatility of growth rates in the period 1992-2001 than in the subsequent period
        2001-2012.
    4. The social welfare in the new millennium has not only improved but also has become less volatile.

8.4 Social Immobility In this section, social mobility is measured by the following three alternative
    divisions of the society:
    1. Social groups by income: poor, middle class and rich
    2. Social groups by age: children, adults and elderly.
    3. Social groups by race: white, black/colored and others.
As discussed before a society is defined to be mobile if the worse off groups improve their welfare more
than the better off groups or in other words gap in economic status measured by social welfare decreases
over time. The degree of mobility is measured by the rate at which the relative mean deviation (RMD) is
declining over time. The increase in RMD over time implies that the worse off groups are relatively
becoming even more worse off. A perfectly immobile society is the one when the some groups are never
able to improve their economic status relative to the whole society. Such a situation causes social tension.
Table 6 presents the estimates of RMD for the three alternative social divisions. The RMD for the social
groups divided by income (poor, middle class and rich) is greater than 1, which signifies that there is a
very large gap in social welfare among the these groups. The RMD for social groups divided by age and
race in turn is much less than 1 signifying much smaller gaps in their social welfare.
The growth rates of RMD presented in the last three rows in Table 6 inform that social mobility had a
decreasing trend in the 1990s between 1992 and 2001 but then the tide reversed. In the new millennium
period of 2001-2012, the social mobility began improving: the relatively worse off social groups
improved their welfare more than the average welfare.

    9. Conclusions
This paper models and measures various dimensions associated with social tensions from a social welfare
function framework. The advantage of this common approach pursued is to make explicit the assumptions
and normative values associated with each dimension used. This allows a starting point to compare them
in a more rigorous way which provides valuable insights.
Our empirical exercises applied to the Brazilian case in the 1992-2012 period allows to gauge how
different social tensions evolved over time. The approach proves to be useful to organize possible
relationships between these social tensions. In particular, the sharp drop of inequality observed in Brazil
during 2001 to2012 generated different implications. The main conclusions reached for this period are the
following:

   •   Social Welfare - During this period the social welfare increased at an annual rate of 5.12% while
       the per capita real income increased at an annual rate of 3.65%, which implies a gain in annual
       growth rate of 1.47% in social welfare.

   •   Poverty - The magnitude of social tension due to the existence of poverty is much smaller than
       that observed for social tension due to inequality but the rate of decline is much sharper. For the
       period 2001-2012 the trend rate of decline in social tension for severity of poverty is 10.79%
       while that the decline for social tension due to inequality is only 1.16%. A general conclusion is
       that the rate of decline of social tension due to poverty is much sharper than that due to inequality,
       because it also incorporates positive growth trends.


   •   Middle Class - One particular contribution here is to derive from an explicit social welfare
       function alienation and polarization measures and to study their relationship with measures of the
       size of the middle class. Our results have shown that alienation movements which does not need to
       use specific income brackets, as do middle class definitions, are particular useful variables to
       predict both changes in the population size of the middle class as well as its share in total income.
       Brazil has been suffering from high degrees of alienation and polarization and both sources of
       social tension were roughly stable in the period 1992-2001. However, in the subsequent period of
       2001-2012 both social tensions due to alienation and polarization have been decreasing sharply at
       annual rates of 1.07 and 0.71 percent, respectively. These are consistent with the occurrence of an
       emerging middle class.

   •   Aggregate Risk - The bottom 40% of the population suffers higher volatility in per capita income
       than the whole population. This is an important observation revealing that the poor have not only
       lower incomes but also suffer from more volatile income. The social welfare in the new
       millennium has not only improved but also has become less volatile.

   •   Social Mobility - An immobile society is one in which some groups are never able to improve
       their economic status relative to the whole society. Social mobility measured in this repeated
       cross-sectional environment is interpreted as how the relative welfare of disadvantaged groups
       such as children and afro-descendent move with respect to the movements in overall social
       welfare. After 2001, social mobility began improving: the relatively worse off social groups
       improved their welfare more than the society as a whole.
