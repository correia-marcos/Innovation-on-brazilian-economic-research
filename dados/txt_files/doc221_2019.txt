Abstract: After three decades of persistently high income inequality, from 2001 Brazil experienced a
downward inequality trend followed by rising mean income growth. Both movements lasted until 2014
according to household surveys. This work describes Brazilian income distribution trends and their close
determinants using a vast array of data sets and empirical methodologies to fill gaps found in the literature.
It attempts to provide a more comprehensive picture looking jointly at inequality, mean, and social welfare
growth rates.. Overall, most of the distributive gains were driven by labour earnings, a channel dominated
by firm-specific effects according to matched employer-employees datasets (RAIS). Rising schooling and
falling returns also played a key role, especially if parents’ educational background is taken into account
(special supplement PNAD). Missing income values did not affect inequality or mean income trends
(PNAD) while replacing top incomes with personal income tax data reduced income inequality fall but
increased mean income growth, suggesting complex measurement and interpretation challenges.
Microsimulation exercises based on various datasets suggest that direct and indirect taxes inhibited
inclusive growth trends, while official monetary benefits did help, in particular conditional cash transfers.
They were better targeted than all other transfers, most of which linked to the Brazilian minimum wage.

Resumo: Depois de três décadas de desigualdade de renda alta e persistente, o Brasil experimenta a partir
de 2001 queda na desigualdade seguida de aumento do crescimento de renda média. Ambos movimentos
duraram até 2014 de acordo com pesquisas domiciliares. Este artigo descreve as tendências da distribuição
de renda brasileira e seus determinantes próximos neste interim olhando conjuntamente para as taxas de
crescimento da desigualdade, da média e do bem-estar social. Usamos uma variedade de bases de
microdados para preencher lacunas da literatura e oferecer um quadro mais completo.. De uma maneira
geral, a maior parte da melhora distributiva foi induzida pela renda do trabalho, canal dominado por efeitos
idiossincráticos de firmas (RAIS). Aumento na educação e queda nos seus retornos também desempenham
papel central, em especial se dados da escolaridade dos pais é levada em conta (suplemento especial
PNAD). Rendas missing não afetaram a tendência da desigualdade e da média de renda. Ao passo que
substituir as rendas mais altas por dados do imposto de renda reduz a queda da desigualdade mas aumenta
o crescimento da renda média sugerindo complexidades no uso e interpretação dos dados combinaods.
Exercícios de microsimulação em bases diversas sugerem impostos diretos e indiretos inibiram o
crescimento inclusivo, enquanto transferências oficiais de renda atuaram na direção oposta. O Bolsa
Família se apresentou mais focalizado que todas outras transferências via de regra conectadas ao salário
mínimo brasileiro.

1.1        Overview

Since the beginning of the 1970s, Brazil has been known as one of the most unequal countries in the world
(Bacha and Taylor 1978; Fishlow 1972; Langoni 1973; Ramos 1993). Its per capita income inequality
presented high instability but no clear trend until 2001, as shown in Figure 1. After the start of the new
millennium, inequality fell every single year until 2014 (Barros et al. 2006; Kakwani et al. 2014; Neri
2004). This falling trend was shared with earnings inequality, as shown in Figure 1 (Ferreira et al. 2016;
IPEA 2013; Neri and Camargo 2002).

In 2003, the income equalizing movement was coupled with an acceleration of GDP growth and, on top
of that, mean household income grew even faster. The above-mentioned inequality trend has a clear
parallel with the rest of Latin America, while its household income growth is at odds with other countries
of the region and with Brazil’s own National Accounts statistics. As a result, until 2014, Gini index-based
social welfare grew three times faster than GDP. In this period Brazil followed a middle path, where the
well-being distribution improved simultaneously on these three fronts. Roughly speaking, social welfare
growth was evenly divided between falling inequality of household income, the differential of mean
incomes between surveys and national accounts, and real GDP growth (Neri 2014). Figure 2 presents the
annual growth evolution of mean, equity, and social welfare, all based on household per capita income.
This paper synthesizes the main results of the Brazilian component of the ‘Inequality in the giants’ project
supported by UNU-WIDER. It describes the evolution of Brazilian income distribution and its close
determinants between 1994 and 2015. A joint look at inequality and mean growth rates is key to providing
a more complete picture of impacts in terms of social welfare within Brazil and World inequality.
Moreover, measurement and causal issues that affect inequality have implications on the mean and vice-
versa. This means analysing the second moment of income distribution without losing sight of the first
moment, or existing synergies between them. The other general point in all the contributions to this project
is that changes of inequality and mean income should be emphasized, and not only their respective levels.
This helps us to address the various period-of-analysis restrictions across different datasets. Differences
across time are also a way to deal with measurement issues and to identify causality.

The key objective here is to assess the relative role of different public policy ingredients in income
distribution changes. The channels behind these changes are diverse, such as increasing education levels,
falling education and experience premiums, the diffusion of social programmes such as conditional cash
transfers (CCTs), and the expansion of contributory and non-contributory social security benefits and
other programmes linked to the minimum wage, which also rose sharply in this period, to name only a
few.

1.2    Organization

In these studies, we offer a description and an interpretation of the main causes of income distribution
changes in Brazil in the last 25 years. Section 2 presents an overview of the main socio-economic
developments and the main economic challenges ahead. We attempt to time the evolution of income
distribution and surveys methodology, setting 2003–15 as the central period of analysis. We also assemble
the main pieces of mean income growth and inequality trends in this period using household surveys.
The rest of the paper attempts to fill the gaps about income distribution changes in the previous literature.
I connect the main questions of the overall project and specific contributions exploring new empirical
possibilities, applying various techniques to a vast array of data sets. Table 1 presents a schematic view
of the main empirical strategies pursued, described in sequence.
Identified administrative records such as RAIS (Registro Anual de Informações Sociais from the Labour
Ministry) has no top coding, which allows us to look at the upper part of the earnings distribution and test
the main determinants of overall earnings distribution changes. In particular, RAIS makes it possible to
construct merged employer–employee records and to measure the role of firms mediating labour earnings
inequality (Section 3)1.
Next, the 1996 and 2014 special supplements to the national household survey PNAD (Pesquisa Nacional
de Amostras a Domicílio from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)), with additional
information on the individuals’ education background is used. This information allows us to assess before
and after the bulk of Brazilian inequality changes intergenerational education changes and to measure
better the changes in the returns to education—in particular, how measurement errors and omitted
variables biases affect the impact of education on the earnings distribution (Section 4).

 Moreover, the longitudinal aspect of RAIS allows us to measure the extent to which the gender-gap changes over the life
cycle occur within or between establishments, and to what extent they are driven by the firm’s sector of activity or occupational
choices. These results will not be included in the present paper for the sake of concision.

Besides exploring new data sources, the project analyses already available surveys using a new lens.
Although PNAD is the main Brazilian household survey used in inequality studies, it is the only official
survey with no explicit imputation for missing incomes values. A new imputation methodology is another
by-product proposed here. Brazil has a well-established tradition of welfare measurement but has not paid
much attention to issues like imputed rents and income measurement period, addressed here (Section 6)2.
In particular, PNAD does not ask questions on direct or indirect taxes and some of the questions on the
official cash transfers are not very detailed We develop a microsimulation framework that details the role
played by individual fiscal instruments in income distribution changes using actual data across different
points in time (Section 6 )3. The last section presents the main conclusions of the paper.


2        Brazilian social and economic developments


This section presents a big picture of Brazilian evolution in the last three decades, using international
social indicators such as the Human Development Index (HDI), Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with an emphasis on poverty and shared prosperity goals.
We connect these developments with the economic policy agenda, especially with regard to structural
reforms. We also attempt to relate Brazilian income distribution changes to household surveys
methodological adaptations, avoiding temporal comparisons across different concepts. Finally, we assess

  Brazil recently released detailed personal income tax (PIT) tabulations from the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service.
Combining these with household surveys gives us a clearer view of the top end of the income distribution.We address only
very briefly these results.

  Besides exploring new data sources, the project analyses already available surveys using new lens. Although PNAD is the
main Brazilian household survey used in inequality studies, it is the only official survey with no explicit imputation for missing
incomes values. Brazil has a well-established tradition of welfare measurement but has also not paid much attention to issues
like imputed rents and income measurement period.

period. The overall objective here is to set the stage for the specific contributions of the project.

2.1    Poverty

The first and main goal of the MDGs was to reduce poverty by 50 per cent between 1990 and 2015. In
this period the proportion of extremely poor fell by 73.3 per cent in Brazil and 70.2 per cent worldwide.
This global poverty reduction is due to the combination of the economic miracles in China and India,
nations that once housed half of the world’s poor (Deaton 2013). Throughout the 1990–2015 period, Brazil
had direct elections for president, and since 1994 it has achieved price stability, which is no small
achievement for a nation that held the world inflation record between 1970 and 1995. Poverty reduction
in Brazil between 1990 and 2015 had a roughly equal contribution of mean growth and reduction of
inequality components. This movement was reversed in 2015, when extreme poverty rose by 23.5 per cent
(Figure 3).

2.2    Human development

The recession and unemployment crisis that emerged in 2015 may be viewed as a sign of unsustainability,
with gains only in income-based social indicators. However, the Brazilian HDI had risen by 0.85 per cent
yearly (above the global average of 0.74 per cent) since 1990, when the so-called ‘citizenship’
Constitution came into effect. In 1990 Brazil had average African HDI levels observed in 2015. In 1991,
about 85 per cent of Brazilian municipalities had very low HDI. In 2010, this statistic was 0.6 per cent.
There was a profound social transformation. The problem is that Brazil disconnected its social policy from
its economic agenda and as result presented stagnated labour productivity and increasing fiscal
imbalances.

The inconsistencies between social and economic progress can be captured in the three HDI components.
Federal public spending as a proportion of GDP in Brazil rose from 10.8 per cent in 1991 to 19.7 per cent
in 2016. The main driving force of public spending was social security payments. In 1980 life expectancy
was 62.5 years; by 2016 this had risen to 75.8 years. That is, every three years, life expectancy advanced
by more than a year. Fertility also fell sharply. The population pyramid aged considerably, yet Brazil did
not implement broad pension reform. Brazil spends 13 per cent of its GDP on pensions and retirement
benefits, while Japan, the longest-living nation in the world, spends 10 per cent. Japan’s share of people
over 65 years old is currently 350 per cent higher than Brazil’s. However, Brazil will multiply its elderly
population share by five in the next 50 years.



                                                                                              4
Education has also advanced in Brazil. In 1990, 16 per cent of children aged between 7 and 14 were out
of school. By 2018, this share was less than 2 per cent, with low quality of inputs. Brazil increased school
coverage but required only four hours a day of school time. In 1980 the adult population had only three
years of schooling, on average, while in 2015 it had eight years. But although education has increased,
labour productivity has not. In 1980, Brazil’s productivity was equal to South Korea’s. Today, it is just
one third of the Korean productivity level due to several factors, including lack of education quality and
connection with economic demands, an inhospitable business environment, closure to immigration, and a
lack of engineers. Brazil has followed an educational agenda focused on citizenship that has its merits, as
the above-mentioned life-expectancy increase suggests, but has had little impact on labour productivity.

In addition, there has been an increase in mean labour remuneration above mean labour productivity (Neri
2014). Disaggregated data reveal that the wage gains distribution has not been accompanied by
improvements in the remuneration fundamental, namely productivity distribution (Alvarez et al. 2017).
The social advancements manifested in the transformation of the trilogy of HDI components were largely
disconnected from productivity and fiscal adjustment considerations, the main two main Brazilian
macroeconomic challenges.

2.3        Inclusive growth

From 1930 to 1980 Brazil was the second country in the world in terms of GDP growth, behind only
Japan. From 1980 onwards growth reduced but democracy and social dimensions progressed. After 2000
inequality fell every single year until 2014. In 2003, the income-equalizing movement was coupled with
an acceleration of GDP growth, and mean household income grew even faster.
The inequality fall was around the mean for Latin America countries, while the excess of household
income growth with respect to GDP is Brazil-specific. Between 2002 and 2012 Brazil was 3rd among the
17 Latin American countries in terms of household income growth but 10th in terms of GDP growth. In
most of the world’s emerging or developed countries, GDP grew more than household incomes and
inequality rose. These contrasts make Brazil an interesting case to study.
Figure 4 illustrates the major reversal of all distributive-growth trends presented in Figure 2, beginning in
the labour market, which was the main driver behind the above-mentioned changes. In particular, from
the last quarter of 2015 every annual variation shows an inequality increase until the first quarter of 2019.
This means that labour inequality rose for 17 quarters in a row. This long inequality rise did not happen
not even in the record Brazilian inequality record achieved in the end of 1980s (Neri 2018).

In late 2015 the main Brazilian household surveys, PNAD and PME (Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego), were
replaced by a new national survey, PNADC (Pesquisa Nacional de Amostras a Domicilio Contínua), in
both quarterly and annual versions, and also in habitual and effective earnings concepts, corresponding to
four different measurement possibilities of the same object. It should be noted that the rise and fall of
Brazilian mean earnings and their equality between 2012 and 2018 is not a robust result across all the
empirical possibilities offered by the new surveys which is worrying. Nevertheless, in all four cases social
welfare trends follow a mountain shape, where 2012 and 2017 represent the base of the mountain and
2014 its peak, as shown in Figure 5. One can say there are no signs of recovery after the crisis. The slow
movement back to mean growth may also be affected by the inequality rise (Neri 2019).

2.4     Shared prosperity

Given the major revision in the main Brazilian household surveys at the end of 2015 and the changing
inequality trends noted above, we focus on the 2003–15 period, looking first at individual incomes of
different groups to capture horizontal inequality trends. Mean income grew in real terms by 3.79 per cent
per year, while the income of traditionally marginalized groups grew at faster yearly rates: blacks (4.8 per
cent), females (5 per cent), Northeast region (5 per cent), rural areas (5.3 per cent), illiterate individuals
(5.6 per cent), mulattos (6 per cent), and spouses (6 per cent).4
SDG 10 captures inequality by focusing on the income growth of the 40 per cent poorest of the population.
It is interesting to compute how much the yearly growth rate between 2003 and 2015 in the mean income
of the whole population (3.79 per cent) differs from that of the bottom 40 per cent (6.39 per cent). The -
2.60 per cent difference is a useful measure of inequality trends. It allows us to disentangle in an additive
fashion the main drivers of this inequality fall, namely: other income sources (-0.65 per cent); years of
schooling (-2.02 per cent), hourly wages per year of schooling (-0.51 per cent), hours worked (0.29 per
cent), occupation rate (0.09 per cent), and labour supply (0.41 per cent). This labour ingredients
decomposition suggests that the faster growth of the bottom 40 per cent is mostly due to years of schooling
expansion and returns to schooling fall. The other point worth noting is that the impact of other income

  Other productive attributes of workers that are in general positively related with earnings, such as technical education,
formalization, job tenure, and firm size, increased their share in the workforce, but those individuals without those attributes
presented the highest wage growth rates in the period of falling inequality (Neri 2014).

                                                                  6
sources on mean growth and inequality is relatively small, suggesting the dominance of labour earnings
effects in inequality trends.

Another policy perspective is to disentangle different per capita income inequality trends. Fiscal
microsimulation exercises reveal that in the 2003–15 period market incomes inequality fell by 2.2 per
cent; when we add to that official cash transfers, gross income inequality fell 2.7 per cent. If we consider
the effect of direct taxes, inequality fell by 2.69 per cent, a similar amount. Finally, when we consider the
effects of indirect taxes, final income inequality fell by 2.56 per cent. Section 7 provides details using the
Gini index, the role played by specific private income sources, and official cash transfers.

Disposable income-based mean and inequality trends are similar to those based on gross income. If we
move to the upper disposable income shares, the respective 2003–15 period yearly growth rates fall:
whereas the bottom half grows by 5.91 per cent, the upper half grows by 3 per cent, the top 10 per cent
by 2.19 per cent, and the top 1 per cent by 2.02 per cent.

Finally, we need to complete the missing pieces of the pure growth puzzle. Household income grew on
average 1.88 per cent a year above GDP in the 2003–15 period. This difference is almost equal to the
difference between labour remuneration and labour productivity. We are able to decompose for the 2003–
13 period the 1.9 per cent a year difference. Only 18 per cent is due to nominal and timing differences,
which is good news—first, because for social welfare purposes CPI is more relevant than implicit
deflators; and second, because it puts the burden of the difference explanation outside National Accounts
versus household surveys information sets.

Instead, we must look at differences between the GDP implicit deflator and the official consumer price
index (IPCA) inflation rates. We see that 20.7 per cent of the residual gap is due to terms of trade (meaning
domestic demand over total demand in an open economy); 29.3 per cent is due to differences between
private consumption and domestic demand; and the residual half is due to differences between CPI and
the private consumption implicit deflator. Social welfare growth cannot be sustained if the costs of goods
and services purchased in the markets rises less than the cost of producing them captured by the implicit
deflator.

We have based our understanding of income distribution trends in Brazil during this century and their
main policy determinants on the main national household survey (PNAD). This takes into account the
impact of different income sources (labour, rents, social security, official cash transfers) and of classical
labour ingredients (participation, unemployment, hours, hourly wages, school premiums). We have also
decomposed the reasons behind the gap between mean household income and GDP growth (nominal
differences, and related to deflators (terms of trade, domestic demand, and consumption)). In the rest of
the paper we will incorporate step by step new data and methodological possibilities explored in the
project to provide a more comprehensive picture.


3        Are firms effects driving formal earnings inequality?5


The vast majority of the empirical literature on income distribution in developing countries uses household
surveys. Brazil established this tradition in the early 1970s. Recently a series of papers have documented
inequality based on personal income tax (PIT) records. Establishment-level administrative records are
also available in Brazil, but these have rarely been used in studies on income inequality. RAIS (Registro

Anual de Informações Sociais) is a matched employer–employee database containing around 30 million
observations per year on workers over the last two decades. RAIS depicts formal employment and wage
differentials dynamics. It is a powerful complement to other data sources (Alvarez et al. 2017; Engbom
and Moser 2017). This section documents the evolution and the main determinants of earnings inequality
in the Brazilian formal sector from 1994 to 2015 using RAIS.
A broad inequality diagnosis using Lorenz curves and the main inequality indexes used in the literature,
such as earnings ratios across different percentiles, the Gini index, and the Theil indexes, shows a
consistent formal earnings inequality fall. Using RAIS, we also compare these results with broader
household surveys, which also present falling trends. For example, the Gini of labour earnings in RAIS
fell by 12.5 per cent between 1995 and 2015, while the concentration index obtained with PNAD data fell
by 19.3 per cent in the same period.

3.1        Top earnings

Unlike other data sources, RAIS does not have top coding, which allows us to measure wages at the very
upper end of the formal earnings distribution. In spite of the overall inequality fall, the monotonic decrease
of earnings growth continues only until the 90th percentile; above this point the trend is reversed, as shown
in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. This evidence is in line with PIT data, which is explored in Section 8
(Medeiros et al. 2015a, 2015b).

J-Divergence measures allow us to disentangle the role played by specific categories of different variables,
including income itself. The share of inequality explained by the top 10 per cent, 1 per cent, and 0.1 per
cent rose between 1995 and 2015: by 20.2 per cent, 43.1 per cent, and 90.1 per cent, respectively.
Similarly, in spite of falling mean schooling returns, the share of inequality explained by those with a high
school diploma rose by 29.5 per cent in the same period (Hecksher et al. 2017; Rohde 2016).

3.2   Breaking down inequality

Standard inequality decompositions based on information theory help us to understand the main
determinants of formal earnings dispersion. These include workers’ characteristics (such as gender, race,
age, education, and spatial location) and firms’ characteristics (sector of activity, firm size, legal nature,
etc.). In general, the results indicate the predominant role played by the ‘within’ component in explaining
total inequality, for the entire historical series of 1994–2015. However, looking at the ‘between’ effect for
the educational categories, we observe a relatively higher contribution. For instance, in 1994, schooling
explained 24.1 per cent of the total inequality measured by the J-Divergence index, while in 2015 this
statistic reached 32.8 per cent.
As we found for several individual workers’ characteristics above, the between–within decomposition for
firms’ characteristics shows the predominance of the ‘within’ component in determining total inequality.
Nonetheless, when we look at a highly disaggregated level by considering firm fixed effects (i.e. each
ﬁrm being a category itself), the results show a remarkable contribution of individual firms. For the 1994–
2015 period, the contribution of firm-specific factors explains around 65 per cent of total inequality in
each year considered. In 2015, the portion of the total inequality, as measured by the J-Divergence index,
explained by the between component reached 64.7 per cent.
Taken together, our findings suggest that, among several workers’ characteristics, differences in schooling
were a primary factor in explaining total inequality in the Brazilian formal labour market. Firm fixed
effects have an even more pronounced explanatory power.

3.3   Inequality changes

When one looks at the changes observed from 1994 to 2015, the power of individual firm effects to explain
the fall in inequality observed is 64.5 per cent. Applying the same type of analysis across time to different
characteristics, we also found the following contributions to inequality fall: education (-4.3 per cent),
gender (2.55 per cent), age (8.8 per cent), macro-region (1.96 per cent), sector of activity (9.92 per cent),
nature of the firm (-2.61 per cent from 1995 to 2015), and firm size (3.06 per cent). The firm effects
explain the total inequality fall between 1994 and 2015 around three times more than the combined
contribution of all the other characteristics considered.
The other striking result is the increasing impact of education on inequality in this period, which is not
intuitive. This effect disappears with a more recent period of analysis. From 2001 onwards, there is a
clearer inequality downward trend; hence, it may also be advisable to consider this period. Education
explained 33.3 per cent of the marked inequality fall observed and thus assumes the role of the second-
highest explanatory variable on the inequality fall observed from 2001 to 2015. Once again, firm effects
explain most (75.9 per cent) of the inequality fall observed between 2001 and 2015. This means that the
gross explanatory power of individual firms to explain inequality in the Brazilian formal labour market is
almost twice that for education. In sum, in the context of inequality change, firms also appear as the main
driving variable.
In Machado et al. (2018) we apply a regression framework to analyse the gender gap specifically. We use
these results here to discuss the broader determinants of inequality within education groups shown in
Figure 8 (Alvarez et al. 2017; Machado et al. 2018). We mention here just the results for people who
finished high school, but without a college education. However, as the results are similar, we can

                                                      9
generalize them for the other categories. The baseline model with basic socio-demographic categories
explains 25.8 per cent of the overall variance of logs of earnings. When we add occupation and sectoral
dummies, the cumulative explanatory power reaches 39.7 per cent. If we add firm fixed effects, it reaches
77.8 per cent.

3.4       Main findings

This section has documented the evolution and the main close determinants of earnings inequality in the
Brazilian formal sector from 1994 to 2015 using establishment-level administrative records. Changes in
the earnings distribution in the formal sector share are among the trends observed in household surveys,
which evidence in particular a marked fall in inequality between 2001 and 2014. However, the distributive
decompression is observed only until the 90th percentile, which is in line with PIT-based evidence. The
analysis of specific groups shows that the share of inequality explained by the top 1 per cent and 0.1 per
cent income-earners rose by 43 per cent and 91 per cent, respectively. We will come back to top income
issues, looking at broader population and income concepts, in Section 6.
In 2015, schooling explained 33 per cent of overall inequality. Firm effects explain 65 per cent of total
inequality. Firms are also central to explaining the marked inequality fall observed. Moreover, firms seem
to drive overall inequality in developed countries such as the US and Germany (Card et al. 2013; Song et
al. 2015).

4         What is the role of education background and returns?6


Education changes are often viewed as the main driver of changes in earnings distribution. In the case of
Brazil, there is low intergenerational mobility and strong dependence on family background. In contrast
with most other countries, Brazil has experienced a strong reduction in educational premiums in the last
two decades. However, omitted variable and measurement error biases possibly affect the econometric
estimates of these effects.
There was also a sharp fall in individual labour earnings inequality between 1996 and 2014. Coincidently,
supplements to the national household sample survey (PNAD) on family background in these two specific
years allow us to clarify the role played by falling education returns. This section takes advantage of this
information to provide new estimates of the returns to education in Brazil using traditional Mincerian

regressions, quantile regressions, and pseudo panels. We also study the intergenerational transmission of
education in Brazil using Markovian regressions.
The main questions posed here are: How has intergenerational mobility in education evolved? (Behrman
et al. 2001; Ferreira and Velloso 2003; Lam and Schoeni 1993). What has been the evolution of wage
premiums with respect to schooling? And, in particular, how has parents’ education affected the returns
and the educational level of their children? (Card 2001; Lam et al. 2015)?

4.1    Intergenerational inertia

Brazil is a country marked by low intergenerational mobility in education. For example, in 2014 among
fathers with completed higher education, 70.7 per cent of their children achieved the same level and 7.09
per cent got a Master’s or a PhD degree. However, how has educational mobility evolved in recent years?
A simple Markovian model shows a strong reduction in the mean intergenerational persistence of
education between the years 1996 and 2014, which went from 0.7 to 0.47. It is important to stress that this
result still places Brazil among the countries with the highest levels of education inertia across generations
(between Germany with 0.2 in 1997 and Colombia with 0.7 in 2001). Indeed, Brazil is now closer to
where Mexico and Peru were at the end of the last century.
Cohort effects regarding intergenerational mobility show that the fall in the persistence of education is
stronger for younger cohorts, coinciding with the fall in education premiums when we take into account
family background data in the regressions (Figures 9 and 10).

Finally, quantile regressions enable us to assess how the intergenerational persistence in education
changed along the income distribution between 1996 and 2014. Comparing directly the coefficients for
the two years, we find that, except for the first two vintiles, the persistence is smaller for 2014 than for
1996, especially in the middle and upper part of the income distribution. In fact, we find stronger
reductions in the intergenerational persistence of education for the richest individuals.

4.2    Education premiums

The two PNAD supplements allow us to address econometric issues of omitted variable and attenuation
bias. First, omitting parents’ education information while accounting for selectivity issues reduces
education premium estimates by 24 per cent. Perhaps more importantly, the fall in education premium is
heavily underestimated when we do not take into account family background. Quantile regressions show
that the highest fall in returns occurred for intermediary levels of education and income (Figure 10).

Cohort effects also show that the reduction in the education premium has been going on over several
generations, as shown in Figure 9.
Information on which member of the family responded to the survey questionnaire was used to assess
measurement error, controlling for availability bias. We find evidence of attenuation bias, reducing
schooling returns by between 14 per cent and 32 per cent.

4.3      Main findings

The empirical exercises performed show that the fall in education premium in Brazil is underestimated
when we do not take into account family background impacts. In particular, when we measure omitted
variables bias for the years 1996 and 2014, we find that they did not cancel out each other over time. This
result reinforces the importance of using two points in time to address the close determinants of earnings
inequality fall.
Although the fall in the intergenerational persistence of education in Brazil (from 0.7 in 1996 to 0.47 in
2014) is contemporaneous with the introduction and dissemination of CCT programmes such as Bolsa
Escola and Bolsa Familia with the same objectives, a causal connection between these factors cannot be
established at this point.


5        Does missing income affect distribution?7


Incomes are information-sensitive and vulnerable to non-response in any household survey. PNAD,
collected by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), is the main household survey used
in inequality studies for Brazil (the others are the Demographic Census, PME, PNADC, and POF).
However, it is the only one with no explicit imputation for missing income values. The incidences of
missing values and null incomes are in proportions that vary over time, as shown in Figure 11. The
movement of inequality reduction observed in PNAD in the 21st century might be affected by the treatment
that is given to both the null and unavailable incomes. In addition, some inequality indexes with useful
special properties cannot be estimated in the presence of null incomes. This section opens with a

5.1    New imputation method

PNAD investigates multiple sources of income that were received in a given month, relative not only to
the people interviewed but to all eligible residents of each sampled household. Generally, income non-
response on surveys tends to be more frequent at top incomes. This is identified as differential non-
response and therefore requires a statistical treatment to correct the resulting estimates for potential bias.
This issue results from the way the survey is conducted (on the PNAD, the reference period corresponds
to one month only) and does not occur with comparable surveys in many other countries (De Waal et al.
2011).
The income imputation process began by fitting the regression models with observations classified as
potential donors. The expected theoretical relations between the income variables to be imputed and all
the other variables available in PNAD guided the initial choice of the potential predictor variables to be
considered in each model. Then, using 2015 data, model selection was performed considering the complex
sampling design of PNAD when testing the statistical significance of the predictor variables. In 2015, 2.9
per cent of the (weighted) sample had the per capita household income altered by the imputation
procedure.
The process of imputing individual incomes generally resulted in higher mean incomes and slightly higher
levels of inequality than the ones estimated in 2001 and 2015 without the imputation. The increase in
mean incomes caused by imputation is higher in 2001 than in 2015. Therefore, after imputation in these
two years, real growth in labour income decreases from an annual average of 1.52 per cent to 1.48 per
cent, and the annual growth in per capita household income decreases from 2.53 per cent to 2.46 per cent.
The point estimates of the Gini index for labour income and per capita household income increase by
0.003 in 2001 and 0.002 in 2015. Thus, the Gini index fall in both indicators between 2001 and 2015
becomes only 0.001 more intense.
We also study the behaviour of inequality in terms of poverty alleviation objectives. The idea is to increase
the weights given to the bottom part of the per capita income distribution, since traditional measures such
as the Gini index place more weight on the upper part of the income spectrum. Any income increase up
to the 75th percentile approximately yields Gini index reductions in Brazil.
Here we focus on the P1 measure using the U$S3.20 a day PPP poverty line, in which imputation reduces
2015 poverty by 16.8 per cent or 0.9 percentage points. Poverty differences across time are much smaller,
not exceeding 0.4 percentage points. In our benchmark scenario, these differences amount to 0.1

                                                                                                           13
percentage point. Although poverty levels present some differences, poverty change estimates—at least
in the 2001–15 period—are not affected by imputation procedures.

5.2      Policy-related marks and imputed rents

Our analysis takes advantage of strong points of the methodology to add a rent imputation into income-
based social measures and to study pressure points associated with minimum wage law in Brazil. With
respect to the latter, in our simulated income exercises, social security benefits and earnings among
informal employees are affected by wage floors together with low skilled formal employees, preserving
key policy-related features of Brazilian income distribution.
Poverty with imputed rent estimates is, as expected, lower. For example, in 2015 using the U$S3.20 a day
PPP line the poverty gap (P1) is 48.9 per cent lower. The P1 between 2001 and 2015 falls from 8.4 to 5.8
percentage points using imputed rents. Using Datt-Ravallion-type decomposition the share of poverty fall
explained by inequality reduces from 45.87 per cent to 30.38 per cent. Although imputed rent does reduce
the relative importance of the inequality component of poverty reduction, it does not affect the Gini
coefficient trends.

5.3      Replacing Top Incomes with personal income tax records?8

The assumption that Brazilian personal income tax (PIT) tabulations are representative of top incomes
generates various impacts on in terms of growth, inequality, and social welfare in the 2007 to 2015 period.
While the evidence shows that the movement of these combined estimates presents a slower inequality
trend fall, income mean growth trends also rise at a much faster pace, which poses possibly higher social
welfare growth rates than suggested by household surveys and new measurement-related issues. In fact,
the social welfare index proposed by Sen (1973)-which results from multiplying mean income by the Gini
inequality index complement-grows faster when PNAD’s top incomes are replaced by PIT data.

5.4      Main findings

Missing income data in Brazilian surveys is more frequent among people expected to be extremely poor
or extremely rich than in the middle of predicted income distribution, potentially affecting inequality
measurement. We propose a new imputation method and apply it to PNAD, the main Brazilian household
survey. Our method preserves both random variability and empirical relations between variables. It also
preserves discontinuities related to Brazilian institutional factors such as labour earnings and various
official cash transfers with values exactly equal to the minimum wage. The imputed values preserve yearly
specificities of different income sources distributions among different groups (e.g. employers, self-
employed, formal employees, and informal employees).
From 2001 to 2015 imputation increases the level of mean income, decreases the main poverty indicators,
and slightly increases inequality indexes. It reduces the mean income growth rate but does not affect
inequality or poverty trends in the period.
Finally, trying to correct top incomes of PNAD based on PIT tabulations slows the inequality fall from
2007 to 2015 but accelerates mean income and social welfare growth.

6. How taxes and transfers steered distributive changes?9


After decades in which the Gini coefficient was stuck around 0.60, it started declining every year from
2001 to 2014, to a Gini of 0.52. However, the main Brazilian household surveys provide information
neither on taxes paid by households nor on some relevant transfers. International comparisons of income
inequality show that Brazil presents high market income inequality and the state does a poor redistributive
job, especially in comparison with OECD countries, transforming it into disposable income inequality.
Previous studies assessed the distributional incidence of the Brazilian tax and benefit system at specific
points in time (Higgins and Pereira 2013; Immervoll et al. 2009; SEAE/MF 2017). There is no previous
microsimulation study in Brazil that evaluates the actual impact of fiscal policy on income distribution
using different surveys over time.
The objective here is to shed light on the role of fiscal policy in determining inequality and poverty trends
in Brazil. To this purpose, we estimate the redistributive effects of the fiscal system centered in the period
2003–2015 using PNAD surveys plus a nationwide expenditure survey (POF). We also applied
microsimulation techniques, and public tax and spending accounts. The analysis includes specific cash
transfers, direct and indirect taxation initiatives.

6.1      Welfare decomposition

The decomposition methodology derived step by step allows us to evaluate causes and consequences in
an integrated manner through growth and inequality components pointing to Gini social welfare function
and standard poverty measures. It enables the assessment of the societal well-being level in a given year
through its two main components (mean income and equality). The method also allows us to disentangle
the contribution of specific official spending and taxation to mean and social welfare growth over time.
The decomposition methodology further yields direct policy targeting indicators, comparing the welfare
gains generated through each policy in comparison with its associated fiscal costs. Table 2 synthesizes the
outcome of this methodology with additive static and dynamic properties.

We have focused on simulated per capita disposable income changes between 2003 and 2015. Gini index-
based social welfare grew by 4.86 per cent per year in this period. This annual welfare increase can be
disentangled into a component of mean income growth (3.48 per cent per year) on the one hand, and a
component of equality growth (1.37 per cent) on the other. The respective welfare growth rate for
disposable income is higher than for initial income (4.36 per cent) and final income (4.47 per cent), but
not for gross income (4.91 per cent). The only two cash transfers that had a higher contribution to equality
than mean income growth were the Family Grant and the Poor Elderly/Disability Benefits (69 per cent
and 30 per cent, respectively). Direct and indirect taxes contributed negatively to welfare growth, reducing
its annual growth rate. However, direct taxes contributed to inequality reduction, since the PIT
contribution to equality growth (0.13 per cent) offset the negative impact of the workers’ contribution to
social security on income distribution (-0.03 per cent). Indirect taxes also had a negative impact on equity
(-0.29 per cent), thus increasing inequality.



6.2      Poverty

Our analysis of inequality links with concentration curves and emphasizes the impact of fiscal policies on
poverty indicators, increasing the weight attributed to the lower end of the income distribution. We apply
standard Ravallion-Datt poverty decomposition to growth and inequality components to assess their
relative roles. Around 57 per cent of our benchmark poverty measure fall was explained by the mean
income growth component and 43 per cent by the inequality fall. Using the same U$S3.20 a day line, the
poverty fall in the 2003–15 period amounted to approximately 69 per cent. This means that the poverty
fall in Brazil was nearly twice that targeted in the UN’s first MDG in less than half the period.
The model outcomes allow us to assess the anti-poverty role played by specific fiscal instruments among
various taxes and cash transfer programmes. The Family Grant, the best-targeted policy, was in action
between 2003 and 2015. If one compares the Family Grant poverty impact with the second-best targeted
cash transfer programme, each monetary unit spent generated a 119.7 per cent higher impact. The Family
Grant concentration curve dominates the perfect equity line and all official cash transfers considered.
Thus, the Family Grant gives relatively more to the poorest. Its contribution to the rise of social welfare
is 2.7 times its contribution to the rise of mean income. However, since its creation in 2003, the programme
has become less and less targeted towards the poor, maybe as a consequence of its steep expansion over
time (Campello and Neri 2013).
Targeting differences also affects aggregate demand multipliers on GDP. Campello and Neri (2013)
presents these multipliers within a social accounting matrix framework: Family Grant (1.78); Poor
Elderly/Disability Benefits (1.19), Wage Bonus and Family Wage (1.06), unemployment insurance (1.06),
and social security benefits (0.53, including public pensions). This means that the contractionary effects
of fiscal adjustments, in particular social security reforms, can be mitigated by increasing pro poor public
spending, e.g. through the Family Grant. Incidentally, the minimum wage10 acts as the numeraire of the
benefits and/or eligibility criteria of almost all official cash transfers, including social security benefits.
The only relevant transfer insulated from minimum wage effects is the Family Grant. This means that
minimum wages do not have a very progressive impact profile in terms of Brazilian Government transfers.
The highest minimum wage impact is a little above the median of per capita income.

6.3   Main findings

This section interacts household survey data with fiscal rules and explores an analytical framework
applied to cover income distribution and poverty changes observed over two decades of Brazilian fiscal
policy. Per capita disposable income for the poorest fifth of the population in 2015 was 153 per cent higher
than in 1995, compared with a growth of 20 per cent for the richest fifth, once inflation was accounted
for. The welfare growth of 4.86 per cent per year between 2003 and 2015 is due more to mean income
growth (72 per cent) than inequality reduction (28 per cent).
The Gini coefficient reduction caused by cash benefits increased from 3.5 percentage points in 1995 to
8.9 percentage points in 2015. The results suggest that official cash transfers accelerated the growth of
social welfare (+1.65 per cent), while direct and indirect tax changes operated in the opposite direction
(reductions of 0.28 per cent and 1.09 per cent, respectively). In a time of tight fiscal constraints, the Family
Grant should be a model for all official cash transfers, vindicating any budget adjustment decisions in
terms of cost-efficiency. Gini reductions due to the introduction of more progressive taxes are still limited
in Brazil and are another area of reform towards higher equality.
The poverty gap fall according to the US$3.20 line was almost equally explained by income growth and
inequality reduction between 2003 and 2015. This indicated that Brazil followed a sort of a middle path
driven by distributive and growth dimensions.


7     Conclusions


This paper synthesizes the main results of the Brazilian component of the UNU-WIDER ‘Inequality in
the giants’ project. We assess the main drivers of income distribution changes and related measurement
issues during the last quarter of a century. We start providing an integrated picture of Brazilian income
distribution using household surveys, disentangling the effects of various policy-related components on
inequality, mean income, and social welfare growth rates. The paper attempts to fill the blanks of this
analysis using other data sources and various techniques.
In 1990, after 50 years of strong growth performance and dismal social indicators, Brazil started an upward
trend in its social performance. Until 2015, there was a poverty reduction of 73 per cent, above the global
fall of 70 per cent. There was also an improvement of the Brazilian Human Development Index above
global trends. Life expectancy at birth increased by one year every three years. However, social security
parameters remained unchanged, implying increasing fiscal deterioration. At the same time, the recovery
of part of the secular delay of the years of study of the Brazilian population occurred without any
noticeable progress in labour productivity. Similarly, the gain in individual labour remuneration was
independent of productivity gains. It was as if the social improvement observed missed the economic
fundamentals that could provide greater long-term sustainability. The recent Brazilian crisis illustrates
that. The crisis emerged initially in macroeconomic indicators in 2012 but social indicators kept improving
and suffered only a major deterioration from 2015 onwards.

Nevertheless there was a major income distribution change in this millennium that is worth analysing. In
the 2003–15 period, Gini-based social welfare grew three times faster than GDP, while for the bottom 5
per cent it was a fivefold difference. Social welfare growth was roughly evenly divided into falling
inequality, real GDP growth, and the differential of mean incomes between surveys and National
Accounts. We decompose these different pieces of income distribution trends considering the impact of
different income sources, labour market ingredients, and price deflators. Social programmes expansion,
education expansion impacts on earnings distribution, and consumer price inflation below producers’
costs inflation were the highlights.


                                                      17
We brought new data and methods to create a more detailed picture. Income inequality was very high and
had no clear trend until 2001 but after that, according to most data sources, it experienced a falling trend
that lasted until 201411. Most of the inequality fall was driven by earnings, which was dominated by firm
effects, at least in the formal sector. Minimum wage rises seemed to affect this channel, creating a wedge
between labour productivity and remuneration but also affecting informal employees. Falling schooling
returns also played a key role in earnings inequality, especially if one takes into account the effects of
parents’ educational background. Education expansion reduced intergenerational education inertia.

Missing values did not affect income inequality measured trends. Nor did the choice of whether to use
gross or disposable incomes concepts. When personal income tax data are used to substitute the top end
of income distribution in household surveys, inequality falls less but mean incomes and social welfare
growth rates are also much higher. It is possible to reconcile these discrepancies with the expansion of
non-taxable income sources. Direct and indirect taxes played against inequality fall, while official
monetary benefits worked in the other direction, in particular conditional cash transfer programmes. The
Family Grant programme had a much lower fiscal cost/social benefit ratio than all other programmes,
most of which were indexed to the rising minimum wage in Brazil. Minimum wage hikes exerted a direct
effect on fiscal accounts without much impact on the bottom part of the income distribution.

   These results are robust using top income shares, bottom 40 per cent, absolute poverty inequality component, and standard
Gini and Theil T indexes. Any income increase below the 75th and the 82nd percentiles respectively reduces these last two
inequality measures. They all present a steep inequality decline since the start of the millennium.
