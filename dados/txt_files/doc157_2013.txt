This paper comes up with different underlying structures of explanatory variables, one for
each country, which drive changes in Sovereign CDS (Credit Default Swap) spreads by
means of a time series analysis and a subsequent cluster analysis. The set of explanatory
variables comprises indicators for the states of the global and local economies, proxies of
risk premia, and other financial variables such as exchange rates and interest rates. We
develop this study for a selected set of 33 investable markets, including developed as well as
emerging markets. Empirical results for emerging countries are markedly different from
developed countries both in terms of sensitivity to some global factors and forecast accuracy
of the estimations.

1. Introduction


As the market of sovereign CDS (Credit Default Swap) is increasing in size and importance,
so is the interest in further the understanding of what drives the variation in CDS spreads.
CDS’s are particularly useful to a wide range of investors, either for hedging existing
exposures or for more speculative activities, as they don’t need to have the reference
obligation in its books.
As investors are increasingly focused on international diversification, they may be willing to
broaden their understanding on issues that impact the sovereign debt and CDS markets (see
Alsakka and Gwilym, 2010). This may be even more the case now, in the wake of a
sovereign bond crisis which in October 2009 engulfed Greece, one year later embraced
Ireland and in May 2011 reached Portugal. Since the financial bailout of the Greek
government in May 2010, investors have been putting pressure on countries with high
indebtedness and low growth prospects. As investors demand higher yields for buying their
sovereign bonds, their sovereign CDS spreads increase in tandem. Then, funding costs have
been driven up to the point of making borrowing from the market very difficult for some
governments. This is the case of governments of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, which ended
up asking for financial assistance from IMF and European Union.
The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of global and local market-related factors
on changes in Sovereign CDS spreads. We develop this study for a selected set of 33
investable markets, including developed as well as emerging markets1. For this purpose, we
use econometric of time series analysis and a cluster analysis. In the cluster analysis,
countries are sorted into groups where the members of each group are as similar as
possible. It is important to emphasize, however, that we don’t aim to provide any framework
for predicting crisis, but to suggest a useful approach for short-term horizon investment
decisions. Our paper is more related to Longstaff et al. (2010), but differentiates from theirs
in some important aspects: i) as our focus is on asset allocation, an extensive set of
investable sovereigns are included in our analysis; ii) the data frequency is weekly; and iii)
we compare results of developed against emerging market sovereigns.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 revises the related literature; Section 3 presents
a short description of the CDS market; on Section 4 we describe the data; Section 5 provides
the empirical strategy and results; and finally Section 6 concludes the paper.


2. Related Literature


This paper relates more closely to Longstaff et al. (2010)2. They find that sovereign credit is
primarily driven by global macroeconomic forces external to the country and that the risk
premium represents about a third of the credit spread. 64% of the variations in sovereign
credit spreads are accounted by a single principal component and those variations are more
significantly explained by U.S. stock, high-yield markets and volatility risk premium
(embedded in the VIX index) than by local economic variables. Our paper, on the other hand,
investigates the underlying structure of explanatory variables for a sample of investable
sovereigns with a focus on the short-term horizon.

While our focus is on the short-term determinants of sovereign risk, Remolona et al. (2008)
are concerned on pricing mechanisms for sovereign risk and propose a framework for
distinguishing market-assessed sovereign risk from its risk premia. They use a dynamic
panel data model with a sample covering 24 emerging countries’ sovereign CDS spreads.
We believe we can provide a more comprehensive understanding of recent developments as
our sample covers a period during which Sovereign CDS turned into a more mature and
liquid market and our sample covers not only emerging countries, but also developed
countries, summing up 33 countries. Moreover, we assume that variation in risk premia
component of spreads is partially, if not fully, captured by the explanatory variables (local
stock exchange index, local short term yield or local term premium).


3. Description of CDS market


Sovereign CDS’s are a growing part of the CDS market. The Sovereign CDS market grew3 in
fast pace since December 2004, from $0.17 trillion to almost $2.4 trillion in terms of notional
amounts outstanding4 in July 2010, while the increase of the whole market of credit
derivatives was from $6 trillion to $30 trillion in the same period. Figure 1 shows that
positions in sovereign contracts have been increasing since December 2004, while for the
credit derivatives market as a whole, total notional amounts outstanding declined in the last
five periods. According to BIS, these declines are largely due to terminations of existing
contracts, by netting gross notional outstanding through portfolio compression and clearing.
Calculated as a percentage of the notional value of the reference obligation, CDS spreads
are the cost of benefiting from an insurance-like contract against default of a reference entity.
The protection buyer pays a premium or spread on a periodic basis and in exchange, upon
the occurrence of a credit event (defined within the terms of a CDS contract) has the right to
sell the bond to the protection seller at face value. Then, it is considered an efficient and
liquid instrument for market participants to mitigate the concentration of credit risk and to
enable credit providers to diversify exposure and expand lending capacity. The protection
seller, on the other hand, can take credit exposure over a customised term and earn the
premium without having to fund the position. The required premium is related to the expected
loss of the bond; the higher the expected loss is, the higher the premium is expected to be.
Moreover, CDS spreads may be useful for gauging the market perception of credit conditions
of specific names, as they provide timelier assessments than rating agencies.
A Sovereign CDS contract has some specificity regarding the triggering credit event and the
reference obligation. The credit event may be a failure-to-pay, a moratorium or a
restructuring. A failure-to-pay occurs when a government fails to pay more of its obligations
in an amount at least as large as the payment requirement after any applicable grace period.
A moratorium occurs when an authorized officer of the reference entity disclaims, repudiates,
rejects or challenges the validity of one or more obligations and, after a pre-defined time
lapse, there is effectively a failure-to-pay event or a restructuring. The restructuring occurs
when there is a reduction, postponement or deferral of obligation principal; when
contractually agreed interest payments are not permitted by the original terms of the
obligation; when there is a change in priority ranking causing subordination to another
obligation; or when there is a change in currency or composition of interest or principal
payments to any currency which is not a permitted currency.

    Notional amounts outstanding are defined as the gross nominal or notional value of all deals concluded and not yet settled on
      the reporting date. These amounts provide a measure of market size and a reference from which contractual payments are
      determined in derivatives markets.

Upon default, there are two types of settlement: physical settlement and cash settlement.
Both of them cause the termination of the contract. In case of physical settlement, the
protection buyer delivers to the protection seller one of a list of bonds with equivalent
seniority rights and the protection seller pays to the protection buyer the face value of the
debt. In case of cash settlement, the protection seller pays to the protection buyer the
difference between the face value of the debt and its current market value.


4. Data


The data sample comprises a set of time series of 33 investment-class markets5. The
dependent variable of the estimation for each country is the change in its CDS spreads. The
characteristics of the CDS’s are the following: the maturity is 5-year and the reference
obligation is a deliverable senior dollar-denominated external debt of the sovereign. In Table
2, we show descriptive statistics for the sovereign CDS spreads.
On the explanatory variables, we select a set of market-sensitive ones, to the extent that they
embed economic reasoning for investors taking short-term decisions on sovereign debt
allocation. We classify them as global factors and local factors. Their description, economic
reasoning and data source are thoroughly informed in Table 3. It is worth mentioning that we
are not concerned on disentangling and assigning the specific effects one variable can
convey and, instead, consider that in the end we choose a sub-set of variables that
expresses views on debt, tax revenue and risk premium in aggregate. U.S. Term Premium
and Local Term Premium, for example, not only provide indirect assessment on future tax
revenues, as they are related to growth prospects through the business cycle, but also
capture risk premia embedded in long term yields. The global factors inform the state of the
global economy on growth prospects, risk aversion, perception of counterparty risk within the
banking system and business cycle: log difference of S&P 500 index, log difference of VIX
index, first difference of TED spread, first difference of U.S. term premium and log difference
of oil price. The acronyms for these factors are, respectively: sp 500 , vix , ted , TP and oil .
The local factors should each provide, in theory, information on specific aspects related to
debt, tax revenue and risk premium: lagged dependent variable (first difference of CDS
spreads), log difference of local stock index, log difference of exchange rate, first difference
of local short term yield, first difference of local term premium and log difference of foreign
reserves. The acronyms for these factors are, respectively: spreadi , stocki , xri , localTYi ,
localTPi and fri .
The dependent and explanatory variables are sampled as weekly changes from July 2005 to
July 2010. All observations refer to end-of-the-day quoted prices. The use of weekly data,
however, prevents us to use other related sovereign credit-related factors, like deficit/GDP
and debt/GDP ratios, which are available only on a quarterly basis. We estimate the
econometric models for a time period encompassing the pre-2007 crisis and crisis periods.
The pre-crisis period is from July 2005 to November 2007, the crisis period, from December
2007 to June 2009 and the post-crisis period is from July 2009 to July 2010. The end of in-
sample period is based on the NBER’s (National Bureau of Economic Research) Committee
announcement6, in which it states that the recession that began in December 2007 ended in

June 2009. Then, the estimation period is from July 2005 to June 2009. We use the post-
crisis period as an out-of-sample period for calculating goodness-of-fit statistics.
Variable transformations are such that “interest rate” variables are transformed into
percentage values, i.e., CDS spreads, originally in basis points, are divided by 100; the other
“interest rate” variables are already in percentage format (TED spread, U.S. Term Premium,
Local Short-Term Yield and Local Term Premium). Then, we transform these variables into
first differences. Moreover, “price” variables are transformed into ∆log(.): S&P 500 index, VIX
index, Oil price, Local Stock Index, Exchange Rate and Foreign Reserves.


5. Empirical Strategy and Results


Our empirical strategy is to first select a set of eligible factors for each country. Secondly, we
choose the best model for each country according to pre-defined set of criteria.
In order to obtain the “best” model specification for each country, we first choose the sub-set
of eligible factors for each country. The focus on a smaller set of testable variables is
paramount for reducing the processing time. Then, we resort to the Granger-causality test
(Granger, 1969) not only for assessing weak endogeneity, but mostly for limiting the sub-set
of eligible local explanatory variables to endogenous and exogenous variables. When
estimating models with all the variables in contemporaneous form, one primary concern is
endogeneity. For example, in the case of exchange rate, changes in this factor may
anticipate changes in CDS spreads. On the other hand, currency devaluation may be
consequence of deteriorating economic fundamentals, i.e., if the public debt is perceived to
be unsustainable in the short term, the government may pursue currency depreciation in
order to soften the burden of servicing the debt. Then, in order to circumvent endogeneity
issues, we run GMM estimations with instrumental variables for the endogenous variables.
When the variable is considered exogenous, we simply use it as instrument for itself; for the
endogenous ones, we use their first lags as instruments. Non-exogenous and non-
endogenous variables are not considered in the model specification. Therefore, by restricting
the testable model specifications to combinations of only endogenous and exogenous
variables, we can filter out some model specifications and save computational cost. Table 5
summarizes Table 4 showing the sub-set of eligible variables for each country, marked with
labels “(*)”, “*” and “&”. Parts A and B of Table 4 show chi-squared statistics for testing,
respectively: i) whether local variables anticipate changes in CDS spreads, and ii) whether
the opposite holds true. A variable is deemed eligible when it is weakly exogenous or
endogenous. When the statistic is non-significant at 10% in Part A, then the corresponding
variable is not eligible. Weak exogeneity is attributed to a variable when the chi-squared
statistic is 10% significant in Part A, but not in Part B. A variable is considered endogenous in
case the chi-squared statistic is 10% significant both in Part A and Part B. In order to provide
a clear view of the set of eligible variables, the weakly exogenous and endogenous variables
are marked with label “*” and “&”, respectively, in Table 5. When there is no label, the
corresponding variable is not considered as eligible. Variables labelled “(*)” in Table 5 are
considered exogenous by assumption, i.e., the global variables and the first lag of the
dependent variable are not due to be affected by the dependent variable in any sense for any
country in the sample.




                                               5/25
In the second step, we select7 the model specification for each country, according to the
following criteria: i) expected signs according to Table 3, ii) at least two 10%-significant
parameters, iii) highest possible number of parameters, iv) highest Adjusted R2 and v)
superior8 to all possible nested9 models; or vi) which satisfies conditions i) and ii) and with
Adjusted R2 higher than model’s satisfying conditions i), ii), iii), iv) and v). Blank cells in Table
6 mean that models including the corresponding factor are superseded by the prevailing
model specification; or that the corresponding factor is just non-eligible.
We also perform a cluster analysis, in which countries are sorted into groups where the
members of each group are as similar as possible10. At the same time, the algorithm
attempts to form the groups to be as dissimilar from one another as possible. In effect, the
algorithm tries to create groupings in a way that maximizes the average distance between
countries in the same group, while minimizing the average distance between countries of
different groups.
Finally, we assess the goodness-of-fit of the estimations and their forecast accuracy.


5.1 Results
The most striking result of Table 6 is that the global variables sp 500 and oil not only show up
as significant estimators for most of the countries, but also that there is a difference in
sensitivity to these global factors between emerging markets and developing countries. Even
for countries for which those global variables don’t show up (Austria, India and Hong Kong),
we find that the estimators for vix and stocki (which are highly correlated11 to sp 500 ) are
significant. The other four countries significantly sensitive to stocki are: Japan, Belgium,
Mexico and Thailand. This is also in line with the perception that government debt riskiness
of these countries are linked to the dynamics of the general state of the local economy and
that the local stock exchange is a very important driver for these local economies. Besides,
no local variable shows up as significant for more than half12 (19) of the sample of countries.
Moreover, for 17 out of 19 of these countries (exceptions are New Zealand and Poland), only
 sp500 and oil are significant. One can argue that for these sovereigns (one third of them are
developed European countries and the remaining is mostly comprised of investment-grade13
European and Asian countries – except for Greece and Indonesia), the main driver is the
general state of the global economy. The pervasiveness of global factors is consistent with
the results obtained by other authors (Longstaff et al. 2010; Pan and Singleton, 2008).

    The total number of models tested comprises all possible combinations of factors labelled with “(*)”, “*” or “&” in Table 5 with
      minimum of three factors. For example, in case of Japan, we have a set of 8 eligible factors (see table 5): sp500 , vix , ted ,

       TP , oil , spread i , stocki and xri . Then, we test   +   +   +   +   +   = 219 models.

     We use F-test (see Greene, 2007) for testing the null hypothesis that the more comprehensive model does not contribute
      additional information. When we reject this hypothesis at 5% significance level, then the more comprehensive model is not
      rejected to be superior to the nested one.

Remarkably, the results also confirm the intuition that spreads of emerging market
sovereigns are much more sensitive to global factors than spreads of developed countries.
Tables 6 shows that estimators for sp 500 and oil are higher in absolute terms for emerging
market countries. Taking estimator values for sp 500 and clustering the non-null values into
two groups leads us to results in Table 7. Statistics in Table 8 just supports the choice of the
number of clusters, as the two-group solution with a Calinski-Harabasz (1974) pseudo-F
value14 of 59.21 is the largest, indicating that this grouping solution is the most distinct
compared with three-group and four-group solutions. Moreover, as expected, we observe a
clear-cut separation between emerging market and developed countries. The results are
similar for non-null estimator values of oil , in the sense that a group of emerging market
countries cluster together distinctively as well.
Another interesting finding is that Brazil and Turkey appear in Table 6 with sp 500 and local
short term yield being significant drivers of riskiness perception of their debts. One common
characteristic of these countries is that they are used to figure in the top list of countries with
high nominal interest rates. Therefore, any move in the policy rate, which is tracked very
closely by short term yields, can cause a relevant impact on the domestic bond and stock
markets and non-domestic derivative markets, like the sovereign CDS market. If a history of
high indebtedness and debt restructurings is any guide, this conciliates with the view that an
increasingly high short term yield signals that the sovereign may be struggling to attract
investors to fund its fiscal deficit. This is due to lead protection sellers to charge higher
premiums on CDS contracts with those debts as reference obligations. Moreover, both
countries share a history of struggle against inflation. According to Blanchard (2005), for
example, in 2002 and 2003, fiscal dominance regime prevailed within the Brazilian economy,
where the monetary policy turned to be ineffective for inflation control and, even worse, a
raise of the policy rate was signaling high riskiness of exchange rate devaluation. In this
case, the realization of currency depreciation led to a reduction in value of local currency
denominated public debt in dollar terms to the detriment of debtholders. Still consistent with
the positive sign for the estimators, the opposite seems to hold true recently, i.e., short term
yields have been declining in those countries and CDS spreads have also been declining
accordingly.
The fact that ted doesn’t show up as significant may be due to the general assessment that,
mainly for countries within the Euro zone and other developed countries, the transmission of
distress from the banking sector to sovereign credit deterioration may occur more like a
structural break than continuously in time. When the ted increases, banks may be not even
relying on each other that short term loan will be repaid in full. Our ex-ante expectation was
that increases in ted , as a stress indicator15 of the banking sector, could have, from some
moment, continuously contaminated risk perception of sovereign bonds. It is worth
mentioning that ted effects are not captured by other global variables, like sp 500 or oil , as
their pair-wise correlations are not high: -12% and -15%, respectively. Thus, the underpricing
of the spillover effect from the financial stability stance to the sovereign debt risk during the
period leading to the 2007-2009 crisis can be tentatively explained by a reliance that
governments would: i) monetize their debts (this may be more the case of United States, but
less the case of Euro-zone country members), ii) wipe out defaulted bank’s shareholders and
subordinated debtholders, or iii) be simply rescued by economically stronger sovereigns.
Anyway, sovereign risk may deteriorate abruptly, once none of those issues are
appropriately addressed. In Iceland and Ireland, for example, problems in the banking sector

     See Annex.
15
     See Table 3.




                                               7/25
brought down market assessment of their debt sustainability in a couple of days, but only
after a prolonged period during which those problems in their respective financial systems
were well-known. In the case of the non-Euro zone member Iceland, although their citizens
voted against repaying depositors in United Kingdom and Netherlands, there was no
sovereign debt restructuring as far as it is concerned. In the end, the IMF and the European
Union provided financial assistance to Iceland and Ireland and CDS spreads referencing
their debts receded as a result.
Colombia is one of a few countries showing significant positive estimator of xri and this
evidence stands as supportive to the hypothesis that the currency channel plays a role in
determining market perception of sovereign credit risk. Colombia is a special case, because
it suffered a recession in 1999, in the wake of the currency crisis in Russia and Brazil, which
threatened debtholders with a possibility of debt restructuring. According to Clavijo (2004),
over the years 1999-2002, the exchange rate depreciated by about 20% in real effective
terms. It is argued that the stability of real exchange rate and the inflation control were
achieved by the implementation of monetary and exchange rate policies during this period.
More recently, imports, exports, and the overall balance of trade are at significant levels, and
the inflow of export dollars has resulted in a substantial re-valuation of the Colombian peso.
Its sovereign credit risk is being priced at lower levels, accordingly.
localTPi and fri don’t show up as significant for any country. The evidence that TP also
shows up as barely significant (only for Thailand) suggests that business cycle effects are
more broadly captured by sp 500 , oil and stocki , while credit risk signals embedded in term
premium and foreign reserves may be encompassed by changes in xri and localTYi .
Moreover, our time series of foreign reserves are obtained as interpolation of the original
data available only on a monthly basis. Then, this treatment of missing values for foreign
reserves may be one reason why we don’t obtain significant estimators for this variable.
Next, we follow through a goodness-of-fit analysis by identifying clusters and by comparing
estimation results of models with lagged explanatory variables and ARMA structural models.


5.2 Robustness Check
We assess the goodness-of-fit of the estimations by means of Adjusted R2, PMAD (Percent
Mean Absolute Deviation) and PHM (Percent Hit Misses). Adjusted R2’s are calculated for
the in-sample period, whereas PMAD and PHM, for out-of-sample period. As a test of
forecast accuracy, we believe that the assessment using PMAD is more intuitive than
squared errors (SE), since it is the average value of the error in absolute terms as
percentage of the average value of the realized value also in absolute terms. PHM, on the
other hand, stands as an assessment of whether the direction of the prediction is accurate or
not, i.e.:

                                   PHM = # HitMisses
                                                         N.
where # HitMisses = number of times the prediction does not have the same sign as the
realized value and N = total number of observations.
While for Adjusted R2, the higher it is, the better, for PMAD and PHM, we should expect low
values.
Clustering results of Table 9 suggest that changes in CDS spreads for emerging market
countries as a class, especially for those within clusters in the lower part of table, show more
potential for prediction than spreads of developed countries. Data in Table 9 are essentially a
rearrangement of goodness-of-fit measures of Table 6, but with each column sorted in
ascending or descending order depending on the measure. Countries in the lowest part of



                                              8/25
the table are associated to better goodness-of-fit measures. Then, we define the number of
clusters and their members by means of Calinski-Harabasz (1974) stopping rule16. The
numbers of groups are robust to Calinski-Harabasz pseudo-F index stopping rule, according
to Table 10. For Adjusted R2, the highest index value is assigned to three as the number of
clusters. For both PMAD and PHM, we parsimoniously choose four as the number of
clusters. Results show that the best performing clusters at the three goodness-of-fit
measures (those at the lowest part of the Table 9) are essentially comprised of emerging
market countries (except for Japan in the PMAD clustering). Their adjusted R2’s are relatively
high and their PHM’s are low. Their PMAD’s, however, are not low in absolute terms, but still
lower than PMAD’s of developed countries. Moreover, Colombia stands out as the common
country across those best performing clusters.
When we estimate the models for each country with exactly the same explanatory variables
as in Table 6, but with these variables in lags, the results are less robust in terms of
significance of parameters and goodness-of-fit as expected. Taking results of sp 500 and oil
in Table 11, we observe that much less estimators show up as significant. Statistically
significant local variables are even less numerous in comparison to Table 6. Besides, except
for a few cases (five out of 97), all the the goodness-of-fit metrics are comprehensively better
for models in Table 6.
As a benchmark for our GMM estimations with lagged explanatory variables, we model
change in CDS spreads as an ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) process.
We proceed with ARMA modelling according to Box-Jenkins (1994) and Enders (2004). The
ARMA(p,q) process is estimated by FIMLE (Full-Information Maximum Likelihood
Estimation). The best model is selected if: i) the AR and MA terms are 10% significant; ii) the
residuals behave as a white-noise process (in which all autocorrelations should be zero), iii)
it has the lowest BIC (Bayesian Information Criteria) statistic, iv) it is non-degenerate, i.e.,
there are no gaps within AR or MA terms and v) when i) and ii) don’t hold, then only criteria
iii) and iv) are taken into consideration. We use Ljung-Box (1978) Q-statistic in equation (2)
at 10% significance level for testing the ii) hypothesis.

If Q exceeds the critical value of   χ 2 with s − p − q degrees of freedom, then at least one
value of rk , which is the sample autocorrelation coefficient or order k, is statistically different
from zero. We set s as 10.
Results of Table 12 don’t allow us to affirm that pure time series-based models are
consistently better than fundamental-based models or whether the opposite holds true. While
adjusted R2’s and PHM’s are, respectively, better for 70% and 55% of the countries in
comparison with the same statistics as reported in Table 11, PMAD’s are higher only for 36%
of the countries.

The empirical evidence is strongly supportive of the models presented in Table 6. The
estimators of important global variables (S&P500 and Oil price) are comprehensively
significant, whereas Local Stock Exchange, Exchange Rate and Local Short Term Yield
show up with significant estimators and with correct signs for selected important investable
emerging market countries. Moreover, goodness-of-fit and forecasting accuracy are much
better for a sub-set of emerging markets than for developed countries. As we expected,
models with contemporaneous variables are consistently better than with lagged variables,
both in terms of significance of estimators and goodness-of-fit. Nonetheless, when analysing
models with lagged variables, one cannot affirm that goodness-of-fit and forecasting
accuracy are better for fundamental-based models than for ARMA structural models.
If the past is any guide (so far we believe it is!) and investment decisions are due to be taken
on a weekly basis, one may consider choosing specific sovereigns for trading credit default
swaps with their bonds as reference obligations and pursuing the proposed econometric-
based framework for forecasting their spreads. In order to use this framework in practice,
however, one must consider some caveats. Models with contemporaneous variables need
one-week-ahead predictions as inputs. In this case, results of Table 6 suggest that
forecasting efforts should be focused on global variables in the first stage, particularly
S&P500 and Oil price. Moreover, the same caveat mentioned by Longstaff et al. (2010)
applies here: the period of analysis is “characterized by excess global liquidity, prevalence of
carry trades and reaching for yield in the sovereign market”.
For future research, one may consider testing other banking sector-related factors or models
with dummy variables. The well-functioning of the banking sector is essential to fostering the
economic development of any country, while the opposite holds true as well: banking crisis
can lead to economic recession. Therefore, distresses in the banking sector, when pervasive
and reaching too-systemic-to-fail firms, like the one that happened during the 2007-2009
crisis, may lead to negative views on the debt sustainability of the corresponding sovereign.
In this sense, whether for paving the way for economic growth or where having a specific
mandate of guaranteeing financial stability, central banks, as lenders of last resort, have an
incentive for recuing the banking sector. In our paper, we use ted as a proxy for distress in
the banking sector, but it doesn’t show up as significant. We conjecture that Sovereign CDS
spreads may not have captured distress from the banking sector, as its transmission to
sovereign credit deterioration may occur more like a structural break than continuously in
time. This hypothesis should be more rigorously tested by including a dummy variable or
other banking-related variables.
As an additional robustness check, we recommend undertaking randomization tests on
selected set of explanatory variables and compare the forecast accuracy ex-post. For
example, if 60% of predictions of changes in S&P500 had been correct, what would have
been the value for PHM (Percent Hit Misses)?

              This table reports, for each country, statistical results of models: i) with expected signs according to Table 3, ii) with at least two
              10%-significant parameters, iii) with the highest number of parameters, iv) with highest Adjusted R2 and v) superior to all
              possible nested models; or vi): which satisfies conditions i) and ii) and with Adjusted R2 higher than model’s satisfying
              conditions i), ii), iii), iv) and v). The dependent variable is the first difference of CDS spreads. All the global and local variables
              are considered for the estimation. Goodness-of-fit statistics are calculated for estimation sample (July 2005 to June 2009) and
              out-of-sample periods (July 2009 to July 2010). Only combinations of explanatory variables labelled with “(*)”, “*” and “&” in
              Table 5 are considered as possible estimation models. The first lag of local variable is used as instrument for the corresponding
              local variable labelled with “&” in Table 5. Variables transformations are such that we apply ∆log(.) to “price” variables (S&P 500
              index, VIX index, Oil price, Local Stock Index, Exchange Rate and Foreign Reserves) and ∆(.) to “interest rate” variables (TED
              spread, U.S. Term Premium, CDS spreads, Local Short-Term Yield and Local Term Premium). The variance-covariance
              matrices are estimated according to White (1980) robust estimation. Local Term Premium and Foreign Reserves don’t show up
              as significant for any country.

              This table reports, for each country, statistical results of models with the same explanatory variables as in Table 6, but in lags.
              The dependent variable is the first difference of CDS spreads. Goodness-of-fit statistics are calculated for estimation sample
              (July 2005 to June 2009) and out-of-sample periods (July 2009 to July 2010). The explanatory variable itself is used as
              instrument for the GMM estimation. Variables transformations are such that we apply ∆log(.) to “price” variables (S&P 500 index,
              VIX index, Oil price, Local Stock Index, Exchange Rate and Foreign Reserves) and ∆(.) to “interest rate” variables (TED spread,
              U.S. Term Premium, CDS spreads, Local Short-Term Yield and Local Term Premium). The variance-covariance matrices are
              estimated according to White (1980) robust estimation.

Determination of the Number of Clusters

‘k’ is the number of clusters to be tested. For determining the clusters, we define the
absolute-value as the distance measure. i.e., countries within a cluster should have low
distances among them and high distances between countries of different clusters. We apply
the absolute-value to two metrics, depending on the partition: one based on medians (for
 sp500 and oil parameters – Table 7) and the other, on means (for goodness-of-fit measures
– Table 9). Arbitrary values for the metrics are initially set for each cluster. Then, each
observation is assigned to the cluster whose metric is closest, and then based on that
classification, new cluster metrics are determined. These steps continue until no
observations change clusters. Finally, we need to compare the fitness of formed clusters.
According to Milligan and Cooper (1985), Calinski-Harabasz (1974) index is one of the best
stopping rules for the determination of the number of clusters. The formula of the index is:
                             trace( B) /( g − 1)
                                                   trace(W ) /( N − g )
where g is the number of clusters, N is total number of observations, B is the between-cluster
sum of squares and cross-products matrix, and W is the within-cluster sum of squares and
cross-products matrix.
Large values of the index indicate distinct clustering.
