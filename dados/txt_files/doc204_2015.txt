Abstract
This paper studies the main drivers of the level and efficiency of municipal spending in Early Childhood
across Brazilian municipalities. At the same time that provides an estimate for ECD spending, this analysis
evidences how redistributive has been the public ECD spending in Brazil and the role of fiscal and political
variables on the distribution of expenses geared to children across Brazilian municipalities. The study also
highlights important local features that explain why some municipalities attain better outcomes than other
using the same amount of resources. The results show that ECD spending is negatively related to income
inequality, do not confirming one of the predictions of the median voter theory. Political and fiscal
variables, like spending capacity and revenue volatility have considerable impact on ECD spending. With
respect the responsiveness to local needs, ECD spending is higher in the municipalities which presented
higher illiteracy rates in 2000, suggesting, politicians preferences were linked to the perceived local needs
for ECD services. In the efficiency analysis, the results show that the municipalities operating in a better
socioeconomic environment (higher per capita income e lower inequality) can more efficiently allocate
their resources to early childhood.

AREA DA ANPEC: ÁREA 5 - ECONOMIA DO SETOR PÚBLICO
         1. Introduction
         Investments geared towards Early Child Development (ECD) should be a priority policy in
developing countries. As pointed out by Heckman and Masterov (2007), ECD policies can increase
productivity in the economy and reduce inequality. According to the authors, investing in young children
who grow up in disadvantaged environment is a rare public policy with no equity-efficiency trade-off. Other
studies, like Campbell et al. (2008), Berlinski et al. (2009), Burger (2010), Nores and Barnett (2010) and
Belfield and Kelly (2013), also evidence the impact of early childhood interventions on cognitive skills and
health outcomes.
         In Brazil, since the nineties, indicators related to early childhood development significantly
improved. The child mortality rate1, for example, decreased, on average, from 46.6 in 1991 to 18.8 in 2010;
almost all children between 6 and 14 years old were in school in 2010 and the school attendance for children
up to 5 years old has significantly increased. In effect, according to Evans and Kosec (2012), Brazil’s
government policy over the last 20 years can be broadly characterized as “prochild”, given the new laws
approved benefiting children2 and the creation of FUNDEF and FUNDEB which increased the education
revenue in Brazilian Municipalities.
         Given the decentralized structure for offering pre-primary and primary education and basic health
services, in Brazil municipal governments are the major responsible for ECD services provision. The
national government programs benefiting the children represent just a small portion of the services provided
to this population. To show this, in 2012 81% of all enrollments in the first to fifth grade are in public
schools are under municipal management3. Moreover, students up to 10 yeas (daycare, pre-primary and
first primary) account for 70% of total enrollment in municipal schools. Concerning the public health care
services, approximately, 92% of all consultations and medical procedures up to age group of ECD were
managed by municipal governments in 2012. In fact, this increase of the services towards the children is
reflected in municipal public spending. According to the National Treasury Office (Secretaria do Tesouro
Nacional), the municipal spending in ECD services rose almost 90% between 2004 and 2012. It is worth
noting that at the same time that some municipalities present very low mortalities rates other municipalities
in Alagoas and Maranhão, for example, present child mortality (under 5 year) rate like 50.94 and 49.264.
Furthermore still in 2010, 76.5% of children between 0 and 3 years old in Brazil were not attending school.
For families in the lowest decile of household earnings, this rate is 83%.
         This context of increase of ECD spending and the existence of localities and individuals demanding
additional effort from municipal governments in the provision of more and better services towards the
children motivates new researches to understand how responsive has been ECD spending to inequality and
local needs across Brazilian municipalities. Despite the theoretical predictions of the median voter theory
on how large must be redistributive public spending according to local high income inequality, there are
some empirical studies not supporting the positive relationship between redistributive public spending and
inequality, like Peroti (1996) and Mello & Tiongson (2006). Assessing whether the differences of ECD
spending across municipalities reflects the differences on inequalities or not helps to understand how public
spending is contributing to reduce the differences of interpersonal income inequality in Brazil.
         Moreover, even if the ECD spending is oriented by local needs, the local government programs for
the children may not attain its goals. Campos (1998) points out that the decentralization process in Brazil
are subject to several risks, given the unpreparedness of municipal governments in terms of administrative
capacity, shortage of technical resources, corruption etc. A clear consequence of such unpreparedness is
the reduction of efficiency of public spending, including those geared towards ECD services. In this
scenario, even with the sophisticated normative basis created in Brazil in the last twenty years for funding
ECD spending, more resources to education and health not necessarily would induce improvements for
children.

        Then, besides providing an estimate for ECD spending, this study presents an econometric exercise
aiming to know the drivers of ECD spending across Brazilian municipalities. This analysis can provide
evidences on how redistributive has been the public ECD spending in Brazil and the role of fiscal and
political variables on the distribution of expenses geared to children across Brazilian municipalities. This
paper also aims to assess the efficiency level of municipal expenditures on ECD services for education and
health care in Brazil, as well to study the determinants of this efficiency. For the determinants of efficiency
level, we consider, particularly, factors relating to socioeconomic characteristics, institutional dimension
and locational issues of Brazilian municipalities.
        In addition to this introduction this paper has six more sections. The following section describes the
used methodology to calculate ECD spending across Brazilian municipalities. The third section presents
the methodology to study the determinants of ECD spending, the efficiency analysis of municipal ECD
spending across Brazilian municipalities and the investigation of the determinants of efficiency of ECD
spending. In the fourth section, the results are discussed. The last section presents some conclusions.

       2. An estimate for the municipal ECD spending in Brazil
        Estimating public ECD spending in sub-national or national level is a challenging task, mainly due
to the difficulty to know whether the spending exclusively benefits children or not. The classification of
Public Spending by Function and Sub-Function indicates which services and goods the government offers,
but does not enables evaluating which individuals benefit from the public spending. Although more
detailed, the Public Spending by program, when it is available, neither provides sufficient information to
know whether the spending is being targeted to children only. For example, in the spending demonstrations
of the Federal Government in Brazil, the spending in the Family Health Program (PSF) it is not split by age
or by social group. According Vargas & Sabatiñes (2010), in Latin America Countries, given the difficulties
for obtaining data on ECD investments, the usual indicator for ECD spending is just preprimary spending.
        Contributing to bridge this information-gap, this study provides an estimate of ECD public spending
across Brazilian municipalities, considering the definition for ECD age group children between 0 and 14
years old. The adopted strategy in this study relies on the assumption that total ECD spending comprises
relevant actions in Education, Health and Social Assistance sectors. In this study, the public spending on
ECD of Brazilian municipalities will be estimated using data gathered from a yearly publication of the
Brazilian National Treasury Office (STN) called Finanças do Brasil or simply FINBRA. This database
presents information on annual receipts and expenditures of Brazilian Municipalities. The functions and
sub-functions are the same as the earlier considered and the period will be the same (2004-2012).
Specifically, it will be considered the spending data reported in the Functions Education, Health, Social
Assistance. In Brazil, all municipalities adopt the same classification of public spending by function and
sub-function. Then there is some basis for comparability across municipalities for the public spending in
these three areas.
        In the Function Education, the sub-function Pre-primary (Educação infantil) comprises all
spending on education of children between 0 and 5 years old. The spending subcategory Primary (Ensino
fundamental) includes expenses on education of children and adolescents between 6 and 14 years old. In
the Function Health, the sub-functions Primary Health-Care (Atenção Báscia) and Food and Nutrition
were considered to calculate the ECD spending. In the sub-function are reported expenses with the Family
Health Program, as pointed out earlier, an important program for reducing infant mortality rate in Brazil.
In the sub-function Food and Nutrition it can be include any program that aims to reduce or eliminate
nutritional deficits. The actions may also aim to guide the population about nutritional values of foods, and
supplement food deficiencies among population or among specific groups such as children at school age,
nursing mothers and their infants.
        In the function Social Assistance, the sub-function Child Assistance (Assistência à Criança) may
be considered an ECD spending. This sub-function may comprise the actions undertaken to support and
protect children and adolescents, providing care for the attainment of their basic needs.
        It is worth noting that, the spending reported in the sub-functions Primary Health Care and Food
and Nutrition are not exclusive for children. In order to estimate the portion of the spending oriented to
children, the expenditure of the sub-function Primary Health Care will be weighted by the share of
consultations of children up to fifteen years old5 in the number of consultations of PSF during the period
2004-2012. This approach captures the fact that the number of consultations of children in the PSF has been
growing over the years, and supposedly the resourses geared towards the population under analysis.

Child Assistance of the municipality 𝑖 in the period t.
        To take into account regional prices differences, the ECD spending by municipality will be deflated
to 2011 using regional INPC price index. To avoid accounting inconsistencies and due to the
incompatibility of the data of different sources, some municipalities were excluded from the sample. In
summary, the main reasons for exclusion were: We excluded municipalities which presented zero values
for education and health spending; the municipalities that declared expenditure on education or health care
higher than total spending were also disregarded; as the estimation of ECD spending involves connections
of the financial information of municipalities with data on the number of consultations for the ECD age
group, this process also resulted in a loss of information. The municipalities which presented small number
of consultations per year, compared to the other similar municipalities were excluded from the sample.
        Table 1 shows the total ECD spending across Brazilian Municipalities between 2004 and 2012. The
values were deflated and are expressed in 2011 prices. Within these period, ECD spending increased from
R$ 43.70 billion to R$ 81.75 billion, which represents a growth of 87% in eight years. In spite of this high
growth rate of ECD spending, the share in the total spending in Brazilian municipalities stays around 24%
between 2004 and 2012 (see Table 1). It means that other public expenses have also grown in same the
proportion. Hence, apparently the expansion of municipal ECD spending seems to be just a part of a process
of public spending raise rather than as expansion in recognition of the potential contributions that ECD
spending growth can bring about.

        According to Table 1, spending on education accounts for 88% of total ECD spending in 2012,
followed by health and social assistance expenditures. The data also reveal that, the share of education
spending increased 3.4 percentage points within the period. The impact of the FUNDEB in 2007 is visible
in this data. In effect, after 2006 the share of Education Spending raised by 2.2 percentage points.
Concomitantly Health spending participation decreased almost 2 percentage points.
        Table stands for the descriptive statistics of per child ECD spending across municipalities. North
region presents the smallest average of per child ECD spending (R$ 2,569 per child or US$ 1,167) in Brazil,
followed by Northeast region (R$ 2,945 per child or US$ 1,339). Both regions present the highest poverty
rates in Brazil and high income inequality (see Table ). Contrasting with this situation, in the South region,
where poverty and inequality is low, it is noticed the largest average of per child ECD spending.

       These regional differences in ECD spending are depicted Figure 1. The map portrays the per child
ECD spending across the considered Brazilian municipalities. In the North region, a great part of
municipalities spend less than R$1,969.49 per year in ECD. In the southern municipalities, the frequency
of municipalities spending more than R$3,848,89 becomes considerably higher. The kernel density map
(Figure 1) shows where are concentrated the municipalities with the highest per child ECD spending,
considering the distance among municipalities and the spending level. In the States of São Paulo, Rio
Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina we can observe the largest concentration of high-ECD spending
municipalities.

            3. Methodological approach

            3.1 Determinants of ECD Municipal Spending
        The literature on the determinants of public spending grounded on the median voter theorem (see
Sanz & Velasquez (2002) and Mendes & Sampaio (2006), Rocha et al. (2012)) suggests a number of local
characteristics to be included as explanatory variables, like population, median income, tax rates and other
controls. Besides considering all these variables, the responsiveness of ECD spending to local needs for
ECD provision will be analyzed. The local needs will be represented by outcomes associated to the scarcity
of ECD services provision6. This approach relies on the hypothesis that marginal utility of public goods is
decreasing. Put differently, despite heterogeneity of individuals’ preferences, the population would be
better off if, for example, mortality rate among children and illiteracy rate are the smallest as possible. The
diminishing marginal utility hypothesis means that the scarcer are the ECD services, the more preferable
will be the additional provision ECD related public services. Because these preferences are supposed to be
shared with politicians, the public ECD expenditures would be larger where the provided ECD services is
not enough to generate the desirables health and education outcomes. Based on these arguments Skidmore
and Deller (2008) argues that Public Spending may converge to a common level (absolute convergence) or
to different levels (conditional convergence).
        Following the adopted approach of Mello and Tiongsnon (2006) to capture the relationship between
redistributive government spending and inequality, the current ECD spending will be explained by the
lagged levels of income inequality represented by the gini coefficient. To capture some non-linearity on the
relationship between public spending and inequality, as proposed by Bénabou (2000).
        The political environment of the municipality will be represented in the model by some
characteristics of the mayor like education level, whether he was reelected or not, political party affiliation
and whether the municipality receives revenues from agreements with federal and state government. These
last two variables may suggest to what extent the national and sub-national political alliances would result
more revenues to the municipality, besides those prevue by law. Variables measuring fiscal decentralization
of the municipality, like spending capacity, will also be included in the model.
        Three models will be estimated. In the first one, the total per child ECD spending in (in logarithm)
is the dependent variable. In the second and third models, the estimates will show the determinants of per
child ECD spending in Education and health. Equation 2 presents the general structure of the models to be
estimated.

needs for ECD spending. In the first equation, the vector L contains the illiteracy rate among 11 to 14 years
old individuals in 2000, an outcome of the provision of education to children in the municipality; mortality
rate among children up to five years old in 2000 and poverty rate among children. For the education
spending equation, L is the illiteracy rate among 11 to 14 years old individuals in 2000 and for the health
spending equation, L is the mortality rate among children up to five years old in 2000. In all cases, if the
parameter estimate 𝛾 is positive, thus ECD spending is acting to reduce welfare inequality across Brazilian
municipalities. If the estimate for this parameter is negative, thus ECD spending may be widening welfare
inequality, once the municipalities presenting the largest mortality, illiteracy and poverty rates are those
who has been spent less in ECD provision.



6   The responsiveness of public investment to local needs was studied by Faguet (2004).
        The variable 𝑋𝑖 is a vector containing political and fiscal decentralization variables and controls
which includes variables like age structure of population, demographic density and distance to capital and
dummies for each State.
        Table 3 stands for the explanatory variables and their sources. The analysis will be carried out using
the average of estimated Education and Health ECD expenditures between 2007 and 2011 previously
estimated. Then, the results capture the fact that a given municipality traditionally spends more on ECD
services. The data on Education spending was deduced from the FUNDEB transfers. Remembering the
distribution of the FUNDEB depends on the number of enrolments in Basic Education system. Disregarding
the FUNDEB resources, the Education spending level becomes more dependent on the municipal
administration decisions. Some of the explanatory variables are for 2010 (given CENSUS information) and
2011. Continuous covariates, like spending capacity, transfers from Federal and State government were
also averaged over the period 2007-2011.
        The tree versions of Equation 2 will be estimated using two stage least squares, considering that
2000 municipal median income is an instrument for 2010 median income. This is because 2010 municipal
median income may be an endogenous variable, partially determined by public spending. The instrument
is correlated to 2010 median income, however is not determined by current public spending.

          3.2. Efficiency of ECD municipal spending in Brazil
        Data Envelopment Analysis (or DEA) approach will be used to calculate efficiency scores of
municipal ECD public spending. DEA is as successful approach to calculate efficiency, and, as pointed out
by Cooper, Seiford and Zhu (2011), DEA method is widely used in various sectors and products in different
countries. The DEA method, introduced by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (1978), uses a nonparametric
approach for calculating the efficiency frontier. The DEA method measures the relative performance of
similar Decisions Maker Units (DMU) comparing the ratio between outputs7 and inputs, generating a single
indicator of performance for each DMU. In our work, the municipalities are defined as DMU, due to
municipal government is the main responsible by supply of basic services to ECD.
        The DEA model to be used in this study is an extension of DEA containing an iterative resampling
process8, known as bootstrap (see Simar and Wilson, 1998, 2000, 2011). This DEA technique minimizes
the bias in the estimation of the efficiency indicator and allows the construction of confidence intervals for
the efficiency score, as can be seen in Equation 3. From a K resampling process, the efficiency score for
                                                              ∗𝐷𝑀𝑈0
each DMU is calculated K times, providing an estimator 𝜃̂𝑘          (with 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐾), in which this score is
calculated by pseudo observations from bootstrap approach: 𝜃̂    ∗𝐷𝑀𝑈 0 = 𝐾 −1 ∑𝐾    ̂ ∗𝐷𝑀𝑈0 . Obtained the set
                                                                                 𝑘=1 𝜃𝑘
of bootstrap values, the confidence interval (CI) of the true 𝜃 can be estimated by the empirical distribution
of the estimates of pseudo efficiency scores, and then the bootstrap approximation for the true CI is given
by:
                     Pr(𝜃̂𝐷𝑀𝑈0 − 𝛿̂𝐷𝑀𝑈0 ≤ 𝜃𝐷𝑀𝑈0 ≤ 𝜃̂𝐷𝑀𝑈0 + 𝛿̂𝐷𝑀𝑈0 ) ≈ 1 − 𝛼                       (3)

Where: 𝜃 is the “true” efficiency indicator, 𝜃̂ is an estimate of the efficiency indicator, 𝛿̂ is the margin of
error estimated by bootstrap process, 𝛼 is the significance level. Based on the confidence interval estimator
for efficiency 𝐶𝐼[𝜃, (1 − 𝛼)] = 𝜃̂ ± 𝛿̂, obtained using the resampling process, it is possible to calculate a
robust efficiency index less sensible to outliers in the data. Moreover, it is also possible to find the size of
the bias of the efficiency estimate: 𝐵𝐼𝐴𝑆𝑘 (𝜃̂) = 𝐸(𝜃 ∗ ) − 𝜃̂.
        The Equations 4 and 5 define the production functions for education and health services 9. The
description of the inputs and outputs included in the production function is in Table , where the outputs
indexed with “𝑎” were inverted (this was done to maintain the positive relationship between inputs and
outputs). In all cases, the vector of inputs (𝒙 ⃗ ) is formed by only one variable, which corresponds to the
health and education ECD spending per child in average of last five years (2007 to 2011). All data are at
municipal level. The period of the input variables cover the years 2007 to 2011 and the output variables are
for 2011. We will use average expenditure on ECD over the years in order to consider the consistency of
the resources invested in the area, as well as to take into account the fact that the investments do not generate
immediate effects on ECD outcomes.

        Given the heterogeneity among Brazilian municipalities, we assume that the production function
exhibit variable returns to scale (VRS). VRS enables evaluating the differences between DMUs which have
great quantity of inputs/outputs (likely operating with decreasing returns) and DMUs with few
inputs/outputs (operating, e.g., with increasing returns). Furthermore, the efficiency score for each DMU
has been calculated in an output-orientated perspective. The choice for output-orientated DEA, supposes
that municipalities can improve efficiency obtaining higher output levels for a given level of per child

7 Here, the output term is more generic, because it corresponds also the outcomes variables like learning indicator for education and mortality
rates for health sector.
8 We use the package for Frontier Efficiency Analysis with R (FEAR) to calculate the efficiency scores – see more details in Wilson (2008).
9 The efficiency analysis is carried out considering only health and education ECD spending. Social Assistance spending was excluded because

more than 1,421 municipalities did not report this type of expenditure or reported zero real (R$ 0.00), and many locations also declared child
assistance costs close to zero.
expenditure. In an input-oriented perspective, efficiency would be improved, for example, reducing per
child ECD spending, for a certain output level.
        The choice of the variables that represent the outputs of the production functions for ECD services
was based on Vegas & Santibañes (2010), which enhance three key outcomes generated by ECD policies:
cognitive development, socio emotional development and physical well-being and growth. Table presents
the input and outputs to be used in the efficiency analysis. The variables that are included as outputs in the
educational production function have three dimensions: learning, enrollment and school quality. The first
dimension is represented, respectively, by language and mathematic scores in Prova Brasil in the fifth grade
of Primary school. The dimension of pre-primary coverage is composed by the rate of school attendance
for children between 0 and 5 years old, which indicates the public sector attention with the kindergarten
and pre-school10. The last educational dimension is formed by proportion of teachers with third degree in
the pre-primary and elementary school and school infrastructure index, including variables like lab, gym,
library and computers for students11. We consider mortality rates as outcomes in the Health production
function (see Table for more details).

10As shown by Conti, Heckman and Urzua (2010), investments in preprimary education has positive effects on student academic performance
in other stages of education, including health benefits for individuals. Therefore, there is no trade-off between the expansion of care in
preprimary education and school outcomes in primary education.

12 The variable rate of underweight children with less 2 years old (weight below the third percentile - lower curve - of the weight curve for

each specific age) can’t be included in the production function (Equation 3), because this variable had a great number (2,013 observations) of
missing values.
        The excluded outliers are those units located in the area above the average plus (or less) 2.575
standard deviation of the average health and education spending. Imposing this restriction to the data, the
number of DMUs used to calculate efficiency on education is 3,977 municipalities, representing about 72%
of all Brazilian municipalities. In this sample, the annual average of per child ECD expenditure on education
is R$ 2,158.83. The number of municipalities for evaluating the technical efficiency of health services is
3,737 units, and the average of per child ECD spending on health (basic attention) is approximately R$

socioeconomic and locational issues of municipalities. As it was seen throughout this study, socioeconomic
and locational issues influence the provision of services for early childhood. According to Naritomi et al.
(2012), the institutional dimension, in particular, has a prominent role in Brazil, due to the formal
components that define the rules of implementation process and financing of the public services, and affect
the peculiarities involved in the definition of local institutions and the distribution of political power.
Considering the data structure, that consists in a cross section of Brazilian Municipalities, and the
peculiarities of dependent variable (censored at 0 and 1), the econometric model used was a Tobit
regression. The dependent variable of the model is the efficiency score (unbiased) obtained through DEA-
BCC with 1,000 resampling for the municipal spending used in early childhood development.
       The model equation has the following structure:
                                         𝐾                    𝐿                    𝑀

Where: 𝜃𝑖𝑠 means the ECD spending efficiency score of the area s (education, health care) in the
municipality i; ID represents the vector of institutional variables; SE is the vector of the socioeconomic
characteristics of the municipality i; LD represents the dimension of locational factors. Table 5 presents the
description in detail of the variables used in this analysis13.

        4. Results and discussions

        4.1 Determinants of Education ECD spending
        The estimates of the coefficients of the main variables of equation 3 are shown in Table . It is also
shown the standardized coefficients of each model. Due to the spending in education represents almost 80%
of total ECD spending, the results of the first and last morel are very similar. In general the results for all
models suggest a U-shaped relationship between per child ECD expenditures and population. Per child
ECD spending may be high in small cities, due to the fixed costs of education and health services. As the
population growths and also the scale of ECD services provision, the per capita expenditures decrease. The
upward trend for the per capita spending may occur because in the largest cities, education and health are
more expensive. These results also mean that the smallest and the biggest municipalities have the similar
per capita ECD spending. The standardized coefficients show that if Population increase by one standard
deviation, logarithmic of total per child ECD spending would decrease 3.07 standard deviations. According
to the standardized coefficients, population variables are those who most impact on ECD spending among
all considered models.

         Income elasticity for total ECD spending is about 0.12, considering all controls and the income
elasticity of education spending is almost 0.4. The estimates also reveal that total and Education ECD
spending are negatively related to income inequality. If this result really represents a causal relation between
ECD spending and income inequality, and not only a correlation, the regional differences of ECD spending
may be contributing to the persistence of regional socioeconomic inequalities in Brazil, instead of
narrowing it. Moreover, the estimated parameter for the quadratic gini coefficient reveals other perspective
for this relationship. The U-shaped relationship suggests that total ECD spending is negatively related to
inequality up to the turning point the curve (gini = 0.52) describing the relationship between ECD spending
and inequality. From this value on, the relationship becomes positive. The same happen with the
relationship of education ECD spending and inequality, with a turning point of 0.53 for the gini index.
         With respect the lagged illiteracy rate variable, the sign of the coefficient estimate is positive in all
versions of the model where this variable was included. Then, the Education ECD spending is higher where
the illiteracy rate was higher in 2000, thereby apparently confirming the hypothesis of diminishing marginal
utility of ECD public spending. Differently from the obtained results for the Education spending
determinants, the health ECD spending is negatively related to the lagged children mortality rate. That is,
the municipalities with the higher children mortality rate in 2000 spent more in primary health care for
children during 2007 to 2011.
         Regarding the variables representing the political environment, the reelection of the Mayor has no
impact on ECD spending. It is worth noting that, excepting the margin of victory in the last elections, none
of the political variables seems to explain the variability of health ECD spending across Brazilian
municipalities. However, in the municipalities where the Mayor finished secondary and tertiary education,
Education ECD spending is about 6% higher than the municipalities where the mayor is illiterate or has
other education level. The fact that the Political Party of the Mayor is the same of the Governor of the
President does not matter for determining Education ECD spending. Contrasting with this result, the ECD
spending is positively related to the fact that the municipality receives transfers from the State Government
as counterpart of Agreements between State and municipality. The margin of victory in the election has a
positive effect on ECD spending.
         The estimate result for the variable Spending Capacity indicates that municipalities with higher
share of locally collected taxes on total spending can spend more in Health. Fiscal decentralization variables
play an important role for determining Education and health ECD spending. The estimates for spending
capacity coefficient indicate an even larger effect on ECD spending: one standard deviation of spending
capacity variable would raise health ECD spending by 0.17 standard deviation.
         With respect the tax share variable, one standard deviation of the share of local collected tax in total
receipts would increase Total ECD spending by 0.05 standard deviation. The estimates for spending
capacity coefficient indicate an even larger effect on ECD spending: one standard deviation of spending
capacity variable would rise ECD spending by 0.23 standard deviation. The revenue volatility negatively
impacts education and health ECD spending. It means that, the municipalities presenting more stability in
revenue over the years spend more in education and health.
         4.2 Efficiency scores
        This section presents the main results on the performance indicators of ECD public spending across
Brazilian municipalities. Verifying the distribution of technical efficiency (unbiased score) in Figure 2, we
identify important differences between the education and health care scores14. In education, we find DMUs
operating with, on average, 82% of efficiency. In the sample of municipalities, 625 of them (about 16% of
all DMUs) are at the left side of distribution (score below 72%) and 19% of DMUs present performance
between 91% and 100%. For the health efficiency score, on average, the DMUs have 51% of efficiency. In
general, the education efficiency score has a more left-skewed distribution, while the distribution of health
score is right-skewed.

        Table 7 shows the average of efficiency level for each region of the country, with information about
unbiased score (obtained by bootstrap), confidence interval, biased score (without bootstrap), as well as
information about the average of the inputs and outputs of each region. The average of technical efficiency
index for ECD expenditures in Brazil is 82% in education and 51% in health care. We emphasize that the
levels of efficiency does not necessarily imply that municipalities present good indicators in these two
areas, because the efficiency indicator is generated simply by the comparison of DMUs close to the
efficiency frontier (defined by benchmarking units).

         Table 7 reveals that, the unbiased and biased scores are very similar. The difference (on average) is
of 1.45% in the level of efficiency in education and 0.97% in the level of efficiency in health model.
However, when we look the bias at level of the DMU, we find municipalities with a bias higher than 10%
in their education scores and cases exceeding 20% in performance indicator for health care. Hence, the use
of the technique provided by Simar and Wilson (1998, 2000) allows minimize the biases in efficiency score,
especially in cities with high sensitivity to changes in the technological frontier.
         The Brazilian municipalities in the most developed regions (South, Southeast and Midwest) are, on
average, more efficient in education ECD spending. While the North and Northeast (less developed) regions
have the most inefficient DMUs, with scores below the country average and insignificant statistical
differences between the regional results across these locations. Efficiency in heath spending is higher in
South, Southeast and Midwest regions, when compared to North and Northeast regions, considering the
biased and unbiased efficiency score. Figure and Figure 4, for example, illustrate the kernel density of
efficiency scores within each region. Based on these findings, efficiency is higher in municipalities of the
South, Southeast and Midwest regions due to the concentration of municipalities close to the efficiency
frontier.

                        Health care
        The shapes of Figures 3 and 4 results from the fact that the majority of the most efficient DMUs in
ECD spending on education (86% of DMUs more precisely) are to the south of the country. The
municipalities in the states of Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP) and Rio Grande do Sul
(RS) have the highest levels of efficiency, respectively, on average, 88.5%, 88.3%, 88.0% and 86.5%. At
the other extreme, the DMUs in the states of Acre (AC), Pará (PA), Amapá (AP) and Alagoas (AL) are the
worst performers. In terms of inputs to education, we identify the less efficient units generally allocate less
ECD resources per child and have even lower educational outcomes, specially, learning indicators. In this
context, given the spending per child, the vector of educational outputs should increase by almost 30% to
make efficient the municipalities located in the states of AC, PA, AP and AL.
        Regarding the health spending, municipal units with the best performance are highly concentrated
in states of South and Southeast regions (about 95% of DMUs in the best class belong to these regions).
The other characteristic of efficiency on Heath Care is a great amplitude of the class intervals (the lowest
value is 19.65% and the hightest value is 98.78%), this diffetence is considerably higher than performance
on education, and evideces the existence of very inneficient municipalities in health spending. The results
reveal that DMUs in the states of North and Northeast have relatively the worst combination of inputs and
outputs.

           4.3 Efficiency determinants
         Table shows the estimated coefficients for the determinants of the efficiency of ECD spending in
Brazil. Initially, jointly evaluating all coefficients, we find that not necessarily the signs, the magnitude and
statistical significance of the parameters are the same. It is worth noting that we are analyzing two different
types of services, which have their particularities in attendance and financing, for example. In education it
is easier to identify the services offered for early childhood. Moreover, in health area, spillover effects may
arise. In effect, it is quite common in Brazil transporting patients from one municipality to another, which
can result in less expense (and higher efficiency) for the municipality that “exported” the patient and more
costs (and lower efficiency) for the locality which received the patient.

         Regarding the impacts of socioeconomic characteristics on efficiency scores, the municipalities with
greater income inequality have lower spending efficiency. An increase of 1% in income inequality reduces
the efficiency indicator of spending on education in 0.10%. This negative effect is also observed for the
efficiency of health spending. The effects of per capita income and the proportion of adults with higher
education in the city on efficiency is positive in all models for both areas. In education area, the coefficient
for illiteracy for the population between 11 and 14 years old is negative and statistically significant
suggesting that the municipalities with more illiterates in this age group tend to be more inefficient.
         Looking at the DMUs demographic profile, we note that the population composition, population
density and population size of the municipality generate statistically significant effects on the
municipalities’ performance, mainly in education spending. In general, larger shares of children under 5
years old in the total population result in lower efficiency. Probably, this finding can be associated with the
difficulty of municipal management to offering adequate educational and health services when the
population in this age group represents a considerable portion of the total population. In some Brazilian
municipalities, especially in the Northern region of the country, the population with less than 5 years old
exceeds a ratio of 15% of the total population.
         Regarding the population group in the Table 8, the municipalities with larger populations have, on
average, more difficult to efficiently allocate their resources in education when compared with DMUs with
less than 10 thousand habitants (base regression). Differently we find that more populated municipalities
tend to be more efficient than the localities of smaller population size for the performance indicator in
health.
         In the specific case of education, the share of total enrollment in private schools does not generate
significant effects. However, the enrollment rate in rural areas in the municipality is negatively associated
with efficiency of educational resources. At this point, an interesting fact in Brazil is the difference between
the services provided to students from rural areas, which traditionally already have an unfavorable family
background (the illiteracy rate in rural areas is about twice the national average). When we checked the
indicators of school quality, such as the index of school infrastructure (SII) and the proportion of teachers
with higher education (TFT) by the quantilies of the rate of rural enrollments, we evidence that the greater
is the share of enrollments in rural areas, the lower is the standard of school quality (see Figure 5).
Moreover, the spending level of these five quantiles are similar, and the highest spending per child (R$
2,336) occurs in the last quantile that refers to municipalities with the highest enrollment rate in rural area.

        In general, the findings for the institutional dimension have better statistical adjustment (including
coefficients with more statistical significance) for the analysis of the determinants of education spending
efficiency. We highlight that municipalities with more volatility in their revenue have a lower education
spending efficiency. For health sector, the effect of this variable is positive, but with statistical significance
at the 10% level. More results in the educational and health care areas have to do with the impact of
earmarked transfers on the efficiency score. According to the results, a higher Fundeb (for education) or
SUS (for health care) transfer per capita decreases the level of efficiency. In effect, an analysis of the
outcomes used in the estimation of efficiency scores shows that municipalities that receive more transfers
are among the cities that have the worst indicators of learning and school quality. These findings may stem
from the existence of misapplication and consequent lack of effectiveness of the transferred resources. In
addition, the DMUs with the highest per capita total municipal expenditure maintained a positive
relationship with performance in education. Here such information may be capturing the spending capacity
of the municipality.
        We can also see that some variables related to the electoral process (as the numbers of voters who
voted in the election – voter turnout – and the rate of valid votes) impact the efficiency of health spending
and, especially, education spending. The re-election of the mayor affects positively just the efficiency in
education. In this case voters seem to recognize the DMU which showed some improvements in educational
outcomes.
        Finally, we point out that locational variables confirm its importance in explaining spending
efficiency. Controlling for those institutional and socioeconomic covariates, the health efficiency scores in
municipalities of the Northeast region are slightly lower than the results from the Southeast region.
Concerning educational performance, DMUs in the Southeast and South regions have statistically
significant superior results to those observed in the municipalities located in other regions.
       5. Final Remarks
        In the last two decades, undoubtedly, Brazil has been experienced several advances in the provision
of ECD services. Concomitantly, to decentralization of the provision of public services, the spending in this
area has been growing in all Brazilian regions even more than the GDP, but this growth in public spending
has not been a specific trend for ECD services. Other spending categories have grown at the same rate over
the period.
        However, analyzing sub-national differences on ECD provision one can notice important
differences mainly between the Northern and Southern municipalities. The Brazilian South Region has
better socioeconomic indicators and per child ECD spending is high. In the North (and also Northeast
region), poverty and inequality is high, but per child ECD spending is low. Apparently, this result suggests
that the responsiveness of ECD spending to local needs is low.
        The conditional analysis on the determinants of ECD spending shows that socioeconomic and
demographic context of the municipality explain the major part of variation of ECD spending across
Brazilian municipalities. With respect the responsiveness to local needs, controlling for a number of
variables, ECD spending is higher in the municipalities which presented higher illiteracy rates in 2000,
suggesting, politicians preferences were linked to the perceived local needs for ECD services. But, ECD
spending is lower where inequality is high.
        As pointed out earlier, an important feature of decentralization in Brazil was the high participation
of transfers on municipal budgets. According to the findings, the municipalities with higher spending
capacity (less transfers dependent) are more prone to spend on ECD.
        In the efficiency analysis, the results show that the DMUs operating in a better socioeconomic
environment (higher per capita income e lower inequality) can more efficiently allocate their resources to
early childhood. As a result, the evaluation of technical efficiency must be viewed with more caution in
locations with adverse social context. Certainly, in these localities, it necessary to implement policies
aiming to improve management and find mechanisms to identify cases of misallocation of resources such
as cases from rural areas that have high spending without counterpart of good indicators in school resources.
