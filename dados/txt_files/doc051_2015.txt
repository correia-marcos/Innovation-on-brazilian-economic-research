This paper provides an estimate of the welfare costs of corruption. We follow the
approach proposed by Welsch (2008), which uses self-rated subjective well-being
(“happiness”) as an empirical approximation to general welfare. Subjective well-being
allows us to include both material and intangible welfare costs associated to corruption.
We estimate our econometric model using a panel of 84 countries. Results suggest that
nonmaterial welfare effects associated to corruption are significantly higher than the
material ones. This means that using GDP per capital as a measure of societal well-
being could severely underestimate corruption costs.

Este artigo estima os custos de bem-estar associados à corrupção. Seguindo a
abordagem proposta por Welsch (2008), utiliza-se a avaliação subjetiva de bem-estar
(“grau de felicidade”) como uma aproximação empírica do nível de bem-estar. A
utilização do bem-estar subjetivo permite que se inclua tanto os custos materiais quanto
os intangíveis associados à corrupção. Estima-se um modelo econométrico para um
painel de 84 países. Os resultados sugerem que os efeitos intangíveis associados à
corrupção são significativamente maiores que os custos materiais. Isto coloca em xeque
a utilização do PIB per capita como uma medida de bem-estar social, que pode estar
subestimando substancialmente os custos da corrupção.

   1. INTRODUCTION

Corruption may be broadly defined as the abuse of public office for private economic
gain. The effect of corruption has many dimensions related to political, economic and
social aspects. The World Bank (2011) has recognized corruption as “… among the
greatest obstacle to social and economic development”.

Empirical research provides evidence that corruption affects the rates of investment
(Mauro, 1995; Brunetti and Weder, 1998; Campos, Lien and Pradham, 1999), GDP per
capita (Tanzi and Davoodi, 1997; Lambsdorff 1999), government expenditures (Mauro
1997; Tanzi and Davoodi, 1997). Corruption may also undermine a country´s ability to
attract foreign capital (Hines, 1995; Fons, 1999).

A recent estimate by World Bank (2013) puts the total amount of bribes paid in both
developed and developing countries in 2000/2001 to 1 trillion dollars, about 3% of
world GDP at the time. As observed by OECD (2014), shocking as these figures can be,
they are not a good measure of the cost of corruption because they represent transfers of
financial assets between individuals, affecting income and distribution but not
necessarily output. The real (social) cost of corruption is inflicted indirectly by changing
individuals´ and firms´ incentive structures, which can lead to lower productivity of
scarce resources, including labor as well as physical and human capital. In addition it is
likely to reduce the accumulation of both physical and human capital and/or lower their
quality. Corruption’s detrimental effect on the efficiency of resource allocation operates
through the weakening of market mechanisms, the reduction in the quantity and quality
of public goods supplied by governments, the diversion of entrepreneurial talent and
real resources to rent seeking, and the subversion of government regulation aimed at
mitigating the effects of externalities. In combination, these effects tend to lower the
level of output and its growth rate. Apart from the substantial output losses entailed by
corruption, its most corrosive effect consists of eroding public trust and ultimately
delegitimizing the state.

How corruption costs can be evaluated? For a long time there have been concerns on
the relevance of GDP per capita as a measure of societal well-being. Disappointment
with corruption may entail psychological costs associated with unlawfulness and similar
intangibles. Such costs may not be captured by GDP per capita, which would
underestimate total corruption costs.

In this paper, we intend to provide an estimate of the welfare costs of corruption. We
follow the approach proposed by Welsch (2008), which uses self-rated subjective well-
being (“happiness”) as an empirical approximation to general welfare. Adopting a
subjective well-being (SWB) approach presents two main advantages with respect the
conventional GDP-related welfare analysis. First, reported subjective happiness is a
satisfactory empirical approximation of individual utility, allowing us to capture human
well-being directly (Frey and Stutzer, 2002). Second, SWB allows us to include both
material and intangible welfare costs associated to corruption.
We estimate our econometric model using a panel of 84 countries. The use of panel data
allows us to control for time-invariant, country-specific characteristics such as stable
cultural differences. This represents an improvement compared to the cross-section
estimates provided by Welsch (2008), which may suffer from omitted variable bias.

Our results suggest that nonmaterial welfare effects associated to corruption are
significantly higher than the material ones. In monetary terms, changes in corruption in
the period 2004-2008 relative to 2000-2004 are equivalent to a change in capital stock
worth approximately 4% of GDP (median)

The paper is organized as follows. After this introductory section, Section 2 describes
the economic model and the. Section 3 presents the econometric model and estimation
results. Finally, section 4 concludes.



    2. ECONOMIC MODEL

The model closely follows Welsch (2008), which proposes a two-equation system to
disentangle the material and nonmaterial welfare costs associated to corruption. The
decomposition is achieved by specifying a happiness equation and an income equation.

Specification of the happiness equation is based on previous findings on the
determinants of happiness, which include socioeconomic, cultural and institutional
factors (Frey and Stutzer, 2002). Various studies provide evidence that, on average,
people living in rich countries are happier than those living in poor countries. In
addition to our social aspect of interest – corruption – people´s happiness seem also to
be influenced by education attainment and age (Clark and Oswald 1994, Helliwel 2003,
Salinas-Jimenez et al. 2011). Institutional factors such as political, economic and
individual freedom may also influence happiness (Veehoven, 2000). The happiness
equation can be written as follows:

v = f( y, c, z)                                                     (1)

where v = average national happiness, y = per capita income, c = corruption measure, z
= vector of control variables (age, education, institutional variables). The partial
derivative with respect to y is expected to be positive, while the partial derivative with
respect to c is expected to be. The relationship between education attainment and
happiness is ambiguous. Education allows better adaptation to changing environments.
However, this higher predisposition to well-being may be compensated by a
proportional increase in aspiration levels. Therefore, we cannot assume any a priori for
the sign of the partial derivative of happiness with respect to education attainment
(Noval and Gavi, 2013). The relation between age and happiness is also ambiguous.
The increasing health problems and loss of important social relationships through
mortality with increasing age lead to predictions of a decrease in quality of life over the
life course (George, 2006). The “role theory” of the aging process, on the other hand,
suggests that self-integration, insight, and positive psychosocial traits such as
satisfaction and self-esteem grow with age and that these signs of maturity in turn
increase quality of life with age (Gove, Ortega, and Style 1989). Findings from
empirical studies are mixed (Yang, 2008). Finally, the derivative with respective to
institutional variables such as rule of law index should be positive.

The income equation is a standard growth equation in which income is determined by
physical and human capital, extended to account for corruption

y = g( k, h, c)                                                          (2)

where k = physical capital per capita and h = human capital per capita. Partial
derivatives with respect to k and h are expected to be positive, since capital
accumulation is positive related to economic growth. On the other hand the partial
derivative with respect to c is expected to be negative. Corruption’s detrimental effect
on the efficiency of resource allocation operates through the weakening of market
mechanisms, the reduction in the quantity and quality of public goods supplied by
governments, the diversion of entrepreneurial talent and real resources to rent seeking,
and the subversion of government regulation aimed at mitigating the effects of
externalities.

By substituting (2) into (1), we obtain the reduced form of the model

v = (g( k, h, c), c, z).                                                 (3)

Taking average happiness prevailing in a country as a measure of welfare, the marginal
welfare effect of corruption can be stated as follows:

          dv ∂f ∂g ∂f
MWE =       =     +                                                      (4)
          dc ∂y ∂c ∂c

The right-hand side of equation (5) shows the decomposition of the marginal impact of
corruption on SWB. The first term refers to the indirect channel through which
corruption affects SWB via income. The second term corresponds to the direct effect of
corruption in well-being, reflecting the nonmaterial impacts such as psychological costs
associated with unlawfulness and similar intangibles.

Monetization of the marginal costs may be obtained by dividing MWE by the marginal
welfare impact of income. This yields the monetized marginal welfare effect (MMWE)
of corruption:

       dv        ∂f
            ∂g
MMWE = dc =    + ∂c                                                      (5)
       ∂f   ∂c ∂f
       ∂y        ∂y

MMWE thus consists of the marginal product of corruption (first term of the right-hand
side) and the marginal rate of substitution (second term of the right-hand side), both
expected to be negative.
The general life satisfaction approach permits to assess the compensating variation for
changes in the corruption level. The compensation surplus (CS) is the amount by which
the expenditure on income can be reduced when public goods supply increases by a
given amount and welfare is to remain constant. A difficulty with the CS or similar
measures in the present case is that income available for expenditure is itself affected by
the public good (bad) in question, an effect unaccounted for by CS. Welsch (2008)
derived an analogue measure to CS that incorporates both effects of corruption in a
comprehensive way. It relies on the circumstance that income is produced by means of
capital, and measures the overall effect of reduced corruption in terms of the amount by
which the expenditure on capital can be reduced when corruption drops by a given
amount and welfare is to remain unchanged.

When corruption changes from the initial situation c0 to c1, the capital cost saved (CCS)
at constant welfare v0 is

CCS = e(v0, w0; c0) – e(v0, w0; c1)                                                 (6)

where e(.) is the capital expenditure function that gives the capital cost to be expended
to attain a predefined level v, given c and w. Subscript “0” refers to the initial situation
and subscript “1” to the final situation. Capital cost saved (CCS) is positive when
corruption drops and negative when corruption increases.

The actual way of computing CCS proceeds according to the following set of equations:

CCS = w0k0 – w0k1                                                           (7a)

v0 ≡ f(g(k0,h0,c0),c0,z0) = f(g(k1,h0,c0),c1,z0)                            (7b)

w0 = gk(k0,h0,c0)                                                                   (7c)

Equation (7a) states that CCS corresponds to the amount by which the expenditure on
capital can be reduced (augmented) if corruption increases (decreases) by a given
amount ∆c = c1 – c0. Equation (7b) implicitly determines (the hypothetical) k1 so as to
maintain social welfare level at v0 for a given ∆c. Finally, (7c) determines the price of
capital, where gk = ∂g/∂k denotes the marginal product of capital.

In the next section, we use an empirical counterpart to the CCS variation in order to
evaluate the changes in corruption levels that have occurred from 2000 to 2008.

    3. EMPIRICAL IMPLEMENTATION

        3.1 Database

Our basic dataset comprises data for 84 countries from 2000 to 2008. Since data is not
available to estimate our model on an annual basis, we have grouped the data into two
periods: 2000-2004 (period 1) and 2004-2008 (period 2). The value of the variable in
period i (i=1,2) corresponds to the average value for the available information within
the time period.
Happiness data

Average happiness by country comes from the World Database of Happiness
(Veehoven 2005). Life satisfaction is assessed according to the four-point scale defined
by table 111B of the Catalogue of Happiness in Nations: not at all happy = 1; not too
happy =2; quite happy=3; very happy=42. The World Database of Happiness reports the
average happiness by country from representative surveys. Aggregating individual
happiness into national averages implicitly assumes the cardinality and interpersonal
comparability of individual statements of well-being. Economists are likely to be
skeptical about both assumptions. However, both of them may be less of a problem on a
practical level than on a theoretical level, as observed by Kahneman (1999) and Frey
and Stutzer (2002). Ordinal and cardinal treatments of satisfaction scores generate
quantitatively very similar results in microeconometric happiness functions (Frey and
Stutzer, 2000).

Measuring corruption

How can one measure the role of corruption in a country? Corruption generally involves
illegal activities, which are deliberately hidden and only come to light with scandals,
investigations and prosecutions. In this context, how can one systematic and credibly
capture its scale and depth? There is virtually no meaningful way to assess absolute
levels of corruption based on hard empirical data. Researchers have to resort to proxies
for the real level of corruption.

The vast majority of empirical studies on corruption rely on the Transparency
International´s Corruption Perception Index (CPI). This is a composite index which
aggregates 13 surveys on the perception of corruption by business people and country
analysts. CPI is expressed in a 10-point numerical scale, and higher CPI values are
associated to more corrupt countries. Despite the widespread use of CPI, the index is
not immune from criticism. Since CPI is to a large extent a subjective assessment of the
level of corruption, some analysts have pointed out that the index may embed an elite
bias, not reflecting the average perception of the population (Corbhan, 2013).

An alternative approach has been taken by Goel and Nelson (1998) and Fisman and
Gatti (1999), who use the number of public officials convicted for abuse of public
office. However, such measure cannot be taken as a definitive indicator of corruption
levels. Higher conviction rates may be related to the effectiveness of the judiciary
system (and/or the midia) of the country. A country with effective courts may present
higher conviction rates than a more corrupt country with a fragile judiciary system. In
this case, conviction rates may not be an adequate indicator of the actual incidence of
corruption, but rather reflect the quality of the judiciary.

2
 The phrasing of the question varies slightly across national surveys. For example, some questionnaires
ask the question “Taking all things together, you would say you are - not at all happy, not too happy,
quite happy or very happy?”, while others use “Do you feel your life at present is - not at all happy, not
too happy, quite happy or very happy?”. Nevertheless, the four-point scale remains the rule for all of
them.
In our application, we adopt the CPI as our proxy for the actual incidence of corruption.
Despite the potential measurement errors due to an “elite bias”, using CPI allows us to
compare our estimates with other results found in the empirical literature. In addition to
that, we think that CPI is a more reliable method to comparing corruption levels across
countries than alternative measures based on judicial procedures concerning corruption.
In the empirical application, we rescale the CPI index so that 0 refers to minimum level
of corruption and 10 to the maximum level.

Additional socioeconomic and institutional variables

Gross domestic product per capita is extracted from World Bank´s World Development
Indicators (WDI). It is calculated in terms of purchasing power parity to control for the
international differences in the cost of living. GDP per capita are expressed in current
international dollars based on the 2011 ICP round3.

Capital stock measured at current purchasing power parities is extracted from Penn
World Table 8.1 We divide it by the total population in order to obtain the capital stock
per capita.

In order to account for age structure, we use the median age of the country provided by
the United Nations Human Development Report. Human capital stock is measured as
the enrollment ration at secondary school, obtained from the WDI database. Enrollment
ratio is computed as the total enrollment in secondary education, regardless of age,
expressed as a percentage of the population of official secondary education age4.
Finally, since the likelihood of crime and violence may influence SWB, we introduce

We use two governance indicators provided by the World Bank as control variables,
namely, the government effectiveness index and the rule of law index. They may be
interpreted as broader measures of institutional quality and social capital. Government
effectiveness is an index that reflects perceptions of the quality of public services, the
quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures,
the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the
government's commitment to such policies. Rule of law reflects perceptions of the
extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in
particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts,
as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. Both indexes range from approximately
-2.5 (weak) to 2.5 (strong) governance performance.

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of the database.

because of early or late school entrance and grade repetition.

3.2 Econometric model

The happiness and income equations are specified in a log-log form. The core
estimating equations can be written as follows:

ln(happyit) = α0 + α1ln(GDP per capitait) + α2ln(corruptionit) + α3ln(ageit) +
α4ln(educationit) + D_period2 + εit                                                (8)

ln(GDP per capitait) = β0 + β 1ln(capital stock per capitait) + β 2ln(educationit) + β
3ln(ageit) +   β 4ln(corruptionit) + D_period2 + ξit                                (9)

where subscripts i and t refer to country and period, respectively. Variable D_period2 is
a dummy for period 2, which is supposed to capture unobserved factors common to all
countries that may affect happiness during 2004-2008. Coefficient vectors (α1, …, α4)
and (β1, …, β 4) are the parameters to be estimated, and error terms are expressed by εit
and ξit.

The use of panel data allows us to control for time-invariant, country-specific
characteristics such as stable cultural differences. This represents an improvement
compared to the cross-section estimates provided by Welsch (2008), which may suffer
from omitted variable bias. For example, religious beliefs and unobserved cultural traits
may influence happiness. If they are also correlated to explanatory variables such as
GDP per capita, cross-section estimates would be biased. Panel data methods may
circumvent such problem. We explore the panel structure of our data by estimating the
happiness and income regressions with different panel data models.

Before proceeding to the estimation analysis, it is worth remarking two aspects of our
equation system given by (8) and (9). First, the specification assumes that the system is
not interdependent. Income is assumed to affect happiness, but not the other way
around. Second, estimation results of equation (8) cannot be interpreted in terms of
causality, since reverse causation may occur: happier societies may hold lower levels of
corruption. Establishing causality would require a valid instrument for corruption in
equation (8). It is not clear which instruments might serve this purpose. Therefore, the
issue of endogeneity of corruption must be disregarded in what follows.

We have estimated several variations of equation (8) and (9), which are presented in the
Appendix. Alternative specifications include additional controls such as crime rate, Gini
coefficient and governance indicators (government effectiveness and rule of law
indexes). In general, results are quite robust to alternative specifications. However, due
to multicollinearity, several explanatory variables were not significant. In what follows,
we restrict our analysis to the core specifications (8) and (9).

Table 2 presents the happiness equation results. We have applied five different
estimation methods, namely: pooled ordinary least squares (POLS), between estimation,
fixed-effects estimation and generalized least squares and maximum likelihood random
effects estimation methods. Bootstraped standard errors clustered by period were
computed by using 500 replications (Table 2 also presents default standard errors and
panel robust standard errors).

Results are quite robust to the different estimation methods, excepting the fixed-effects
estimator that does not provide statistically significant results. The lack of significance
may be due to the minor changes over time in variables such as median age and
education. Application of the Haussman test provides evidence that the random-effects
models are preferred to the fixed-effects method.

The income and corruption coefficients have the expected sign. Higher average income
goes with higher average happiness. On the other hand, corruption has a direct negative
effect on happiness: higher levels of corruption are associated to lower happiness. Our
results provide evidence that the age structure also determines happiness: countries with
lower median age are associated to higher levels of happiness. This result contradicts
Yang (2008). However, as discussed in Section 2, theory does not provide an
unambiguous guidance regarding the sign of our age variable. Finally, the random
effects estimators (our preferred method) suggest that the education does not determine
happiness. They suggest also that, controlling for the other explanatory variables, on
average countries experienced higher levels of happiness during the period 2005-2008
when compared to 2004-2008.

Table 3 presents the income regression results. All the coefficients have the expected
signs. Higher physical and human capital stocks are associated to higher income levels.
Higher corruption perception is associated to lower income. Consistent with life-cycle
arguments, countries with a higher median age are associated to higher income.

In line with Welsch (2008), our estimates support the basic hypothesis that corruption
has both indirect (income related) and direct (income independent) effects on welfare

Parameter estimates from the happiness and income regressions allow us to calculate the
marginal welfare effect of corruption and its monetized value. The empirical counterpart
for the MWE expressed in (4) may be obtained by computing
            ^                                      ^   ^
MWE = α 2 * ( happyit / corruptionit ) + α 1 * β 3 * (happyit / corruptionit )

where the first term in the right-hand side of equation (10) corresponds to direct effect
and second term to the indirect one. Table 4 presents the marginal welfare. The median
value (50th percentile) of the total effect is -0.022. This means that in 50% of the cases
an increase in corruption by 1 point reduces happiness by approximately -0.022 (on the
ten-point scale). We observe that the direct effect is substantially higher than the
indirect effect of corruption. This result suggests that the indirect channel through which
corruption affects SWB via income plays a minor role when compared to the direct
channel. This means that using GDP per capital as a measure of societal well-being
could severely underestimate corruption costs. The monetary equivalents are
substantial. The median value for the total effect is about USD 1,069 per capita per year.

   4. CONCLUSION

How corruption costs can be evaluated? For a long time there have been concerns on
the relevance of GDP per capita as a measure of societal well-being. Disappointment
with corruption may entail psychological costs associated with unlawfulness and similar
intangibles. Such costs may not be captured by GDP per capita, which would
underestimate total corruption costs.

In this paper, we intended to provide an estimate of the welfare costs of corruption. We
followed the approach proposed by Welsch (2008), which uses self-rated subjective
well-being (“happiness”) as an empirical approximation to general welfare.

The direct effect was found to be substantially larger than the indirect effect and to
imply a considerable welfare loss. This means that using GDP per capital as a measure
of societal well-being could severely underestimate corruption costs.

In monetary terms, the changes in corruption in 2004-2008 relative to 2000-2004 are
equivalent to a change in the stock of physical capital. In monetary terms, changes in
corruption in the period 2004-2008 relative to 2000-2004 are equivalent to a change in
capital stock worth approximately 4% of GDP (median). The welfare costs of
corruption, as measured by the monetized effect of corruption on subjective well-being,
are thus of considerable magnitude.
