Resumo:
As Instituições de Ensino Superior (IES) são consideradas um repositório de conhecimento que
pode contribuir para o desempenho inovador das empresas, através de uma relação cooperativa,
colaborativa ou interativa. Poucos estudos avaliam quantitativamente a importância da
cooperação entre universidades e empresas, considerando o desempenho inovador das mesmas,
para o caso do Brasil. Este estudo visa preencher esta lacuna, investigando os efeitos das
interações universidade-indústria (IUE) sobre os resultados da inovação nas empresas
brasileiras, através de um método não-paramétrico, Propensity Score Matching (PSM),
baseado em algoritmos de pareamento de indivíduos (no caso, empresas) pertencentes a grupos
distintos, cujo objetivo é julgar os efeitos de determinado tratamento. O método foi aplicado
aos microdados de 2008 e 2011 da Pesquisa de Inovação Tecnológica (PINTEC) do Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). Mediu-se o desempenho da inovação por
solicitação de patentes e por vendas líquidas e exportações de produtos novos ou
significativamente aprimorados. Estimativas com dados de 2008 não mostraram associação
significativa entre IUE e O desempenho da empresa inovadora. Em 2011, não se obteve
resultados sobre os efeitos relevantes da IUE sobre as vendas líquidas de produtos inovadores.
O único resultado robusto foi um efeito positivo e significativo da IUE sobre a exportação de
novos produtos, em 2011. No geral, os resultados deste estudo revelam uma fraca relação entre
a colaboração com a universidade e desempenho da empresa inovadora no Brasil.

Abstract:
Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are considered a repository of knowledge that can
contribute to firm’s innovative performance through cooperative, collaborative or interactive
relationship. Few studies evaluate quantitatively the importance of cooperation between
universities and firms to innovative performance in Brazil. This study aims to fill this gap,
investigating the effects of university-industry linkages (UIL) on the results of innovation in
Brazilian firms through a non-parametric method of matching estimator to calculate the
average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Using firm level data obtained from the
Technological Innovation Survey (PINTEC), collected by the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics (IBGE) in 2008 and 2011, we measured innovation performance by patent
applications and by net sales and exports of new or significantly improved products. Estimates

1 Introduction
        Innovation is related to search, discovery, adoption of new products and new processes,
and new management techniques, as stated by Dosi (1982). According to Freeman (1987) and
Lundvall (1998), for theoretical purposes, the concept of National Innovation System (NIS)
should be the institutional framework for understanding the role of innovation on economic
growth. The experiences of developed and developing countries show that differentiated
learning processes to promote innovation are the foundation of economic development. For
this reason, learning activities – its nature, its determinants, and its economic effects – should
become the focus of attention of public policy, including those aimed at developing the role of
higher education institutions (HEIs) in promoting innovation.
        The elements that underlie the relationship between universities and firms, in order to
promote innovative activities, constitute the so-called university industry linkages (UIL). The
UIL is one of the ways used to promote innovation and is the focus of analysis of this study.
The role of universities and public scientific and technological institutions goes beyond
providing skilled labor for the labor market. Companies have been surrounded by instruments
that facilitate the possibilities of innovation in their products and services. Given the
importance of techno-scientific processes, strengthened by partnerships between universities
and companies, the literature considers that innovation is the way for a long-term sustained
economic growth (Jaffe, 1989; Langford, 2000; Etzkowitz, 2009).
        This study aims to investigate the effects of university-industry linkages (UIL) on the
results of innovation in Brazilian firms. We use data from the Technological Innovation Survey
(PINTEC), collected by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in the years
2008 and 2011, including firms in manufacturing and service sectors. The results of innovation
that will be considered in this paper are patent applications, domestic sales of new or
significantly improved product, and exports of new or significantly improved product. Two
empirical strategies are used to assess the importance of UIL for innovation in Brazil: cross-
sectional ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and matching estimators to compute the
average effect of treatment on the treated (ATT). The estimates are based on a 2008 sample
with 7,957 firms and a 2011 sample with 6,882 firms.
        This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the role of UIL
on the firm’s innovative performance. Section 3 presents the methodology and describes the
database used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 provides and discusses the results. Section 6
presents some concluding remarks.

2 Innovations and University-Industry Linkage (UIL)

       We use the concept of National Innovation System (NIS) to characterize the innovative
environment. NIS is an arrangement that connects businesses and institutions in a network in
which there may be changes in terms of technology and knowledge, in order to promote the
accumulation of skills and learning (Lundvall, 1998). Higher education institutions (HEI),
                                                                                                  3




universities and research centers, are part of this network, and they play a key role in technology
transfer processes to promote innovation and to improve the performance of the firm.
         Freeman (1988) and Nelson (1993) characterize the NIS as an institutional construction.
It could be the product of a planned and conscious action, or the result of unplanned and
uncoordinated decisions, but it is aimed at giving impetus to the technological progress in
complex capitalist economies. Lundvall (1998) explains that the concept of NIS involves the
dynamics of a system that aggregates organizations to promote science, technology and
innovation. According to Lundvall (2007), the leading institutions in the NIS are the HEIs,
because they function as a source of information for businesses and of skilled labor. The
graduates of universities act both as innovators and as agents that balance the relationship
between higher education and economic change through innovation.
         According to Freeman (1987) and to Lundvall (1998), the NIS is a network of
institutions in the public and in the private sector that promotes activities that initiate, import,
modify and diffuse knowledge and technology. The NIS has several participants: the firms,
with its R&D laboratories and their cooperation and interaction networks; the educational
institutions, such as universities and/or research institutes; the financial system, capable of
providing funding in support of innovative activities; the legal system and the governments;
and the coordinating institutions. It should be emphasized that the concept of NIS presented
here postulates the capillarity of agents and actions that give shape to the institutional
environment.
         Patel and Pavitt (1994) mention the elements that form the basis of a NIS, including the
structures and incentives that drive technological knowledge for the promotion of economic
development. Similarly, Freeman and Soete (1997) depict the NIS as a network of public and
private institutions that carry out activities related to the process of creation and diffusion of
new technologies. According to these authors, the analysis of NIS allows to identify the causes,
directions and rhythms of creation of these new technologies. They also address the importance
of a national system, requiring up external agents that contribute to the innovative process, and
the subsequent technical progress resulting from economic growth.
         A retrospective of the NIS’s is presented by Nelson (1992), including an analysis for
15 countries. Dating from the early 1990s, this study alludes to the relevant "spirit" concerning
the nationwide technologies. There is a combination of technological capabilities of firms as a
key source of competitive performance, built at the national level. And here lies the importance
of universities, which assume two key roles: (i) be a place where scientists, engineers, and other
professionals get their formal training; (ii) be a place where there is a high concentration of
research in the disciplines associated with the development of technologies. Therefore, two
important functions of the university can be highlighted: teaching and research. Nelson (1993)
specifically refers that when universities or public research laboratories contribute to national
companies, there tends to be a direct interaction between companies and members of faculties
or research groups, either through consulting, or by other bond mechanisms.
         Despite the benefits and gains offered by a structured and consolidated NIS as a space
for promoting innovation, this system also receives criticism, focusing especially on the NIS
as a methodological apparatus of analysis. Broström (2008b) criticizes the approach of the
innovation system applied by Freeman (1987) and Lundvall (1998) arguing that it does not
provide a robust guide on how to evaluate and analyze the possibilities of measuring the
creation of knowledge. For example, the R&D area is not necessarily configured as a
measurement of innovation. Broström affirms that the NIS is just a concept, not an analytical
tool. He proposes an analytical instrument for the study of the dynamics of innovative activities
                                                                                                    4




through a new concept called Innovation System Services. This system can be defined as a set
of factors that have potential influence on the opportunities in certain groups of actors to
perform innovative activities efficiently.
        Broström (2008b) conducted a case study with multinational companies that invest in
R&D in Sweden. He identified three types of factors that influenced the process of investment
in R&D, including: (i) people with solid educational background, language skills, multiple
skills and long-term commitment; (ii) opportunities for the creation of networks of contacts
among similar firms, consultancies and governments to ensure high-level research on a global
level; (iii) joint funding opportunities in R&D, leading to the creation of new networks of
contacts. In his study, Broström suggests a migration from NIS along the lines of Freeman and
Lundvall, which focuses on countries, regions or sectors, to a NIS with focus on stakeholder
analysis (actors-activities nexus at hand). Showing a similar point of view, Mowery and Sampat
(2006) understand that the NIS – and other instruments designed to understand the institutional
framework of innovation – demonstrated deficiencies with regard to criteria to compose a data
collection guide and to define indicators on innovation activities. The concept of NIS is, in
broad sense, relevant and interesting. However, there is some difficulty in collecting data about
it, identifying the stakeholders and systematizing the research that could portray the NIS.
Regarding the role of HEIs in NIS, Mowery and Sampat (2006, p.210) argue that there is a
process of reconceptualization of universities and their institutional role in national and
regional innovation systems: “[...] a growing number of industrial-economy and developing-
economy governments seek to use universities as instruments for knowledge-based economic
development and change”.
        Villela and Magacho (2009) present a historical approach on the NIS development in
Brazil. According to the authors, it is a consensus that Brazil has an immature and inefficient
NIS compared to the developed countries innovation systems. There is in Brazil a lacking
infrastructure of science and technology, with low articulation with the productive sector, and
reduced contribution to the country's economic performance.
        Mansfield and Lee (1996), based on data from 1975 to 1985 for the United States
indicate that about 10% of new products and processes in high-tech industries have developed
based on academic research. According to Arbo and Benneworth (2007)4, universities are the
"key-players" in the NIS. Even if universities show certain "isolation" in terms of practical
applications in business, they promote the diffusion of ideas. However, as they are located in a
dedicated institutional setting, the impacts of their activities occur at a regional level, especially
considering the "local support" that universities can provide, for example, in terms of
laboratory experiments. Bell and Pavitt (1993) highlight the importance of the institutes of
basic and applied research to generate new products, processes and services.
        According to Langford (2000), for a long period of time the HEIs were studied with
focus on its role of transfering knowledge or technology, although this is a linear way to
understand its participation in the innovation process. Over time, this framework has become
insufficient. Uyarra (2008) reinforces this point when he says that organizations are complex
and therefore take a number of activities that end up having direct and indirect impacts on the
economy. He also points out the changes in the tasks of HEI over the last 25 years: from simply
producing knowledge to creating "links" in the higher education system and in the different
economic sectors.
        Jaffe (1989) conducted a study analyzing the influence of the university in generating
patents and R&D in US companies. He found that university engenders R&D in firms, but the

process does not necessarily occur in the opposite direction. According to him, a government
that enhances its system in partnership with a university tends to increase the generation of
local innovation, expanding R&D in companies and increasing their productivity.
        Bosch et al. (2005) performed econometric exercises for Latin America with a focus on
human capital and on absorptive capacity of firms. The authors found that the lack or shortage
of UIL in Latin America delays its development. Still on Latin American context, Sutz (2000)
emphasizes the efforts of universities to promote relationships with industry, and the provision
of managed state funds to encourage innovation in the firm.
        Table 1 shows some selected studies on the impact of the UIL on innovation. The table
is not exhaustive. Studies show similar results, in the sense that UIL is considered beneficial to
innovation, but cooperation with the university is not always a determining factor to firm’s
innovative performance. Cooperation is closely linked to industry and to firm characteristics,
and may be improved by government support. There are also sectoral differences. As Lööf and
Broström (2008) asserts, the collaboration with universities had a positive effect on innovation
activity of large manufacturing companies, but this effect was not confirmed for companies in
the service sector. Another difference to be highlighted is related to the type of innovation.
According to Robin and Schubert (2013), cooperation with the university had an effect on
product innovation, but the same result was not observed for the innovation process.

3 Methodology and database

        The evaluation of the role of university-industry linkages (UIL) on the innovative
output of firms in this paper was based on innovation results (patent application) and on the
firm performance linked to innovation (domestic sales of new or significantly improved
products and exports of new or significantly improved products by Brazilian companies). The
empirical strategy used to measure the effect of these linkages is a non-parametric method of
matching estimator, developed by Abadie and Imbens (2002) and Abadie et al. (2004), to
calculate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Although the matching estimator
is more adequate, since it reduces the selection bias due to the fact that companies that have
interaction with the university are more likely to innovating, the OLS estimator is useful to
establish a preliminary analysis of the relationship between innovation and UIL as a
benchmark.

3.1 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

        The OLS estimates for the years of 2008 and 2011 are used to identify the relationship
between UIL and three dependent variables: (i) the patent application, (ii) the domestic sales
of new or significantly improved products, and (iii) the exports of new or significantly
improved products by Brazilian companies5. The idea is to find the effect of UIL on innovation,
controlling for other possible explanatory factors, which are based on the characteristics of
firms that influence their innovative capacity. The literature on the impact of university-
industry linkages suggests a long list of characteristics that affect the firm’s decision to
establish a relationship with universities, such as: adoption of foreign technology, size of
company, R & D expenses, market share, market structure, prices of inputs, labor relations,
property rights, among other institutional aspects of the firms (Karshenas and Stoneman, 1995).
The choice of the independent variables in this study follows the literature and was based on
Lööf and Broström (2008), with adjustments for the data available in our source of data, the
Technological Innovation Survey (PINTEC)6. Equation (1) was specified to investigate the
relationship between innovation and interaction with the university.

  The information about patent applications is not available in 2011. For this reason, the regressions in this year
were specified only for net sales and exports.

  Lööf & Broström (2008) used the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) III in Sweden and this study used the
Technological Innovation Survey (PINTEC) in Brazil. Both surveys are inspired by the Oslo Handbook (FINEP,
2005). The Handbook was developed in the early 1990s and was intended to serve as guidance for the data
gathering on technological innovation.

       In this specification, the dependent variables are patents, innov_net_sales, and

3.2 ATT matching estimator

        The second empirical strategy makes use of the ATT matching estimator. A discussion
about ATT matching estimators can be found on Rubin (1977), Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983),
Heckmann and Ichimura (1997), Wooldrige (2002), Heckmann and Navarro-Lozano (2004),
Imbens (2004), Abadie et al. (2004) and Imbens and Wooldrige (2008). The first step to
estimate the ATT is to calculate the propensity score matching (PSM), obtained by separating
the firms into two groups according to the importance attached to universities or research
institutes as partners for innovative activities. A categorical variable about the importance of
UIL to the firm, reported in PINTEC’s questionnaire, was used to classify the firms in each
group. For each firm in the treatment group (firms with collaboration with universities) we
identify firms in the control group (firms without collaboration with universities) whose
characteristics are similar. The idea of matching is to identify firms with no collaboration with
the university with the same probability to interact with universities as the collaborative firms.

        A logistic model was used for calculating the PSM. The dependent variable refers to
the probability of the firm to interact with the university. The firms are matched according to
the PSM. The model must contain the relevant variables to explain the propensity to interact
with universities and these variables should be chosen based on firm’s characteristics that
influence the decision to engage in collaboration with the university. Following the literature,
the variables in the OLS regression described in the previous section were used to estimate the
logistic model. The methodology used in the empirical model is described in Abadie et al.
(2004).
        In formal terms, we consider a firm i, i=1,…,N and an innovation performance variable
Y (patent application, for example). There are two possible outcomes: Yi(1) is the performance
of firm i when it attributed high or medium importance for universities or research institutes as
partners for innovative activities (UIL =1); Yi(0) is the performance of firm i when it attributed
low importance or did not developed partnerships for innovative activities (UIL=0). We are
interested in the difference τ(i) = Yi(1) – Yi(0). The problem is that τ(i) can’t be calculated, since
Yi(1) and Yi(0) are not both observable for the same firm. We use the matching approach to
solve this problem.
        Matching the firms requires a conditional independence assumption. Conditional on a
vector of explanatory variables X to innovation performance, the fact that the firm maintains
or not a collaborative relationship with the university must be independent of the non-
collaborative firm performance. This is why the logistic model should include all the variables
that are relevant to explain both collaboration and performance of non-collaborative firms.
Each individual of the treatment group (firms with collaboration with the university) will have
a pair in the control group (firms without collaboration with the university) with similar values
of the variables that compose X. In this sense, conditional on X, Yi(0) for UIL=0 has the same
distribution of Yi(0) for UIL=1. Comparing the two groups allow us to estimate the average
effect of treatment on the treated (ATT).



3.3 Database

        The data used in this study was provided by the Technological Innovation Survey
(PINTEC), conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). PINTEC
builds national and regional industry indicators about technological innovation activities in
Brazilian firms and is considered the main source on innovation in Brazil. We used 2008 and
2011 surveys in our investigation. PINTEC 2008 refers to information collected from 2006 to
2008, and PINTEC 2011 refers to 2009 to 2011 period. In PINTEC’s questionnaire, firms are
asked about the importance of universities or research institutes as partners for innovative
                                                                                                9




activities11. We considered firms with university-industry linkages (UIL) those that pointed out
alternatives 1 (high importance) or 2 (medium importance) in the questionnaire. Those that
marked alternative 3 (low importance) or alternative 4 (did not develop partnership with the
university), and those who did not answer the question were considered firms without UIL12.
        The 2008 data has 7,957 innovative firms, including manufacturing and services
sectors. The sample used in this study consisted of 626 firms with UIL (treatment group) and
7,331 without UIL (control group). In the group of innovative firms stand out the food products
manufacturing industries (786 firms), the information technology services (629 firms) and
machinery and equipment manufacturing (568 firms). In the group of innovative firms with
UIL, the activities of information technology services (82 firms) and manufacture of computer
equipment, electronic and optical products (57 firms) are noticeable.
        The sample of 2011 contains 6,882 firms in the manufacturing and services sectors. The
available data cover a total of 735 firms with UIL (treatment group) and 6,147 firms without
UIL (control group). The main activities in the group of innovative firms are support to the
extraction of minerals (682 firms) and machinery and equipment manufacturing (572 firms).
In the group of innovative firms with UIL stands out the sector of food products manufacturing
(86 firms).


4 Findings

        According to the OLS estimates in 2008 (Table 3), the UIL coefficient is positive and
significant for patent applications and for net sales and exports, suggesting that there is a
positive effect of collaboration between firms and universities on innovation. In addition to
UIL, the variables inc_fiscal_2, patent_invention and patent_model also showed positive and
significant coefficients for the three dependent variables. The variable innov_exports, which
was included as an independent variable in the first two models, also showed positive and
significant coefficients. Thus, when firms used tax incentives of Informatics Law as
government support for their innovative activities (inc_fiscal_2) and when they had patents to
protect product and/or process innovations (patent_invention and patent_model), the firms
achieved positive results in terms of patent applications and domestic sales and exports of new
or significantly improved products. In the case of exports (innov_exports), the estimates show
it has positive effects on the patent application and on net sales.
        The results of 2011 show that the UIL coefficients are positive and significant for net
sales and exports, confirming the results of 2008 with respect to the relevance of the interaction
of the firm with the university on innovation. Other independent variables also exhibited
positive and significant coefficients. This is the case of the coefficient of inc_fiscal_2, which
reinforces the results obtained in the 2008 regression. The coefficient of the variable
financ_proj_without_coop, that refers to firms that used funding to R&D and technological
innovation projects without partnership with universities or research institutes, show that the
firms that requested such funding obtained positive results on net sales and on exports. The
variable impact_2, which refers to the "high", "medium" or "low" importance that the firm
attaches to the impacts of product and process innovations implemented to open new markets,

presented coefficients that suggest that this kind of innovation has positive effects on net sales
and exports.
         Taking into account the results of 2008 and 2011, the variable market_br, with respect
to the main market of the firm, should be highlighted. In the case of the dependent variable
innov_net sales, the coefficient of market_br was positive and significant. This result makes
sense, since it refers to the income of domestic sales of new or significantly improved product.
If the focus is the domestic market, it is expected positive effect of the product with innovation
on domestic sales. On the other hand, the coefficient for this variable is negative and significant
for the dependent variable innov_export. According to the model, there is a negative
relationship between the performance of exports linked to innovation and the fact that the main
market of the firm is domestic.
         Table 4 shows the results of the logistic model used to compute the propensity score
with 2008 and 2011 data. In 2008 estimates, the largest part of the independent variables
showed positive and significant coefficients for the dependent variables patents,
innov_net_sales and innov_exports. Two results stand out. The first refers to the variable
market_br, which presented negative and significant coefficients, indicating that the firm

whose main market is domestic is less likely to UIL. The second relates to the size of the firm. The
logistic model for patents and net sales showed a positive and significant coefficient for the variable
large_comp, pointing out that companies with 500 or more employees are more likely to UIL,
compared to medium and small and micro companies. The logistic model for exports, which has the
large company as reference, presented negative and significant coefficients for micro_small_comp
and medium_comp variables. This reinforces the result of higher tendency of large companies to UIL.
        The logistic model for 2011 also presented most of the independent variables with positive
and significant coefficients. The results accentuate the importance of the size of the firm for the
propensity to UIL. In the model for net sales, in which the variable medium_comp was the reference,
the coefficient of large_comp was positive and significant, while the coefficient of
micro_small_comp was negative and significant. In the model for exports, the large_comp was the
reference, and the coefficients of micro_small_comp and medium_comp were negative and
significant. In both models, the results of 2008 were confirmed: the larger the company, the higher
the propensity to interact with the university. This result corroborates what was found in Varzim and
Monsueto (2011).
        In order to obtain the estimated ATT, the propensity score was used for pairing the group of
innovative firms with UIL with the group of similar firms that are not engaged in UIL. We used four
matching algorithms to increase the robustness of the results and give more consistency to the
analysis: (1) One-to-one, (2) Nearest neighbor, (3) Radius, and (4) Kernel. The results are in Tables
5 and 6. In all types of matching, the effect of UIL on innovation was positive for the dependent
variables patents, innov_net_sales, and innov_exports in 2008 (Table 5). The same is observed in
2011 (Table 6) for the dependent variables innov_net_sales and innov_exports. However, in 2008 the
ATT was significant only for the variable patents in kernel-based matching. In 2011 the ATT was
significant for the variable innov_exports in all kinds of matching and for the variable
innov_net_sales in kernel-based matching. Although some results seem to prove that the relationship
with the university affects the innovation performance of firms, other results do not allow establishing
this conclusion. The results for 2011, for example, suggest that the influence of collaboration with
the university is significant for the exports of products with innovation. However, the 2008 results
do not confirm this inference.
        The results found in this study are related to what was described in the literature presented in
section 2, which reports mixed results on the effects of UIL on innovation. In the case of patents,
where data is available only in the 2008 survey, the results confirm what was found by Marins (2010).
According to him, despite being a traditional indicator of innovation in developed countries, patent
applications are not as relevant in developing countries. Lööf and Broström (2008) also refer to
inconclusive results of UIL on innovation when samples are separated by type of firm. They found
that collaboration with the University positively influences the sales innovation as well as the
propensity for submission of patents for industrial companies with 100 or more employees. However,
considering the total number of companies, including manufacturing and services, the results show
no significant association between collaboration with universities and innovation. According to the
authors, "some of the estimates suggest interaction between universities and firms affects innovation
performance and some does not. The differences are on the one hand explained by firm size and by
sector, on the other hand by the different applications of matching estimators" (Loof, Broström, 2008,
p 87). In our paper most ATT estimates were not significant, revealing a weak association of UIL
with innovation.

       The quality of the matching procedures can be assessed in the last lines of Tables 5 and 6 by
the pseudo R2 and by the mean absolute standardized bias, before and after matching. It is expected
a lower pseudo R2 (near zero) after matching, which occurred in all cases. There should be no
systematic differences in the distribution of covariates between the two groups, therefore the pseudo
R2 must be reasonably low (Caliendo and Kopeining, 2005). Finally, we observed bias reduction after
matching in all estimates.

5 Conclusions

        The aim of this study was to evaluate the university-industry linkages (UIL) in terms of their
effects on innovation, focusing on the performance of Brazilian firms. Although some of the literature
on the subject supports the hypothesis that there is influence of cooperation with the university on
the innovative capacity of the firm, some studies do not identify causal relationship between UIL and
innovation. The results of our study indicate that, in Brazil, collaboration with the university has a
weak relationship with innovation, when it is measured by patent applications and net sales and
exports of new or significantly improved products.
        We used two empirical strategies to evaluate the effect of collaboration with the university on
innovation. In the first strategy, we run cross-sectional ordinary least squares regressions with 2008
and 2011 data. The results showed a positive and significant influence of the collaboration with the
university on the innovative performance of the firm. However, the second empirical strategy, which
consisted in the use of matching estimators to determine the average effect of treatment on the treated
(ATT), exhibited ambiguous results. Estimates made with the 2008 sample, despite having positive
coefficients for the UIL, showed no significant association between collaboration with universities
and innovative firm performance, measured in terms of patent applications and net sales and exports
of new or significantly improved products. According to estimates in 2011, which did not include
patent applications for lack of data, there is also no association between UIL and net sales of
innovative products. Considering different matching algorithms, the only robust result was a positive
and significant effect of UIL on the export of new products in 2011.
