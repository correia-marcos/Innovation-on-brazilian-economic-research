    O presente estudo analisa o ciclo de vida da poupança privada dos indivíduos no Brasil,
    refletindo sobre a evolução da proporção de poupadores dado o processo de
    envelhecimento da população. Para isso, através das POFs 1995-1996, 2002-2003 e
    2008-2009, compararam-se as probabilidades de poupar e de despoupar3 dos indivíduos
    conforme suas idades, empregando um modelo logit multinomial. Como sugere a
    hipótese do ciclo de vida, os resultados confirmam uma incidência maior de poupadores
    em idades intermediárias da fase adulta, frente a um percentual maior de despoupadores
    entre os idosos. Entretanto, dada a estrutura etária brasileira, a mudança demográfica
    ainda deve ser positiva nos próximos anos para o crescimento do número de
    poupadores.

    This study analyzes the life cycle of private individuals' savings in Brazil, reflecting on
    how the proportion of savers changes as the population ages. To this end, a multinomial
    logit model is used to compare the probability of savings and dissavings for individuals,
    according to their ages, based on data from the Household Budget Surveys (HBS) of
    1995-1996, 2002-2003 and 2008-2009. As the life cycle hypothesis suggests, the results
    confirm a greater incidence of savers among middle-aged adults, compared to a greater
    percentage of dissavers among the elderly. However, given the age structure of the
    Brazilian population, demographic change is still expected to result in an increase in the
    number of net savers over the coming years.

1. INTRODUCTION
        Savings is a key macroeconomic variable, despite theoretical controversies about its
real role in economic growth. The issue has drawn even more attention with the Solow growth
model (1956), which holds that, leaving technology constant, economic growth will be
determined by a country's population growth rate and national savings rate. Subsequently,
other models have continued to include savings among the variables that influence economic
growth.
       In this context, the demographic transition is especially significant because household
savings, an important component of national savings, will be directly impacted by population
aging. This relationship received attention in the mid-20th century, when two closely related
theories linking the age of individuals to their savings and consumption behavior became
prominent: the life cycle hypothesis (MODIGLIANI and ANDO, 1957; ANDO and
MODIGLIANI, 1963) and the permanent income hypothesis (FRIEDMAN, 1957). Both
assume that individuals seek to maximize their utility through a consumption profile
compatible with their lifelong earnings.
         Because consumption needs and income vary with an individual's age, the life cycle
hypothesis holds that young people's consumption needs exceed their income, due mainly to
education and housing expenses, while in adult middle age, higher incomes allow individuals
to save more. Finally, during retirement, reduced income requires individuals to spend the
savings they have accumulated during middle age. According to the permanent income
hypothesis, individuals would prefer to distribute their consumption uniformly over time,
without having to reduce it because of lower income during their retirement. Therefore, it
states, they consume only that portion of their income that will persist over their lifetime. In
other words, just as in the life cycle model, adults will save during the period of their
maximum income.
        Against the background of the life cycle model, and in view of the rapid demographic
transition Brazil is currently undergoing, with a marked reduction in fertility and mortality
rates in recent decades, the present study aims to estimate the effect that age has on the
probability that individuals will be savers or dissavers. This makes it possible to reflect on the
effects of demographic transition on the private savings of individuals and the country. To
accomplish this, the three most recent Household Budget Surveys (HBS) were analyzed with
regard to trends over time, and the results are compared with the existing literature.


2. Review of the literature

        Leff (1969) was among the pioneers in empirical studies that sought to examine the
relationship between savings and aging. Through a linear regression model using a set of 74
countries, the author estimated the savings rate in relation to income (S/Y) and savings per
capita (S/N), using the dependency ratio of young people4 and the dependency ratio of elderly
people 5 as regressors, as well as the rate of economic growth and per capita income. The
author found that in both the total sample and the subset of developing countries, a greater
proportion of young and elderly people had a negative effect on savings, but with differing

active individuals (15 to 64 years of age).

degrees of elasticity: a 1% increase in the proportion of young people reduced the savings rate
four times more than a 1% increase in the proportion of elderly people.
        Gupta (1975) sought to discover not only the direct effect of dependency ratios on the
savings rate but also their indirect effects through variations in income. To do this, the author
used the two-stage least squares model for 40 developing countries. His results indicate that
the total effects of the dependency ratios were even greater than those found by Leff (1969).
        However, while studies using aggregated data have found dissavings with increases in
the dependency ratio of elderly people (Leff, 1969; Gupta, 1975; Wachtel, 1984; Bosworth,
Burtless, and Sabelhaus, 1991), studies using individual data have found little statistical
significance (Heller, 1989; Masson and Tryon, 1990). Seeking explanations for this
difference, Weil (1994) used data from a 1984 American study entitled "Panel Study of
Income Dynamics" to examine the intergenerational relations among households. The
hypothesis was that an elderly person might affect the savings not only of his or her own
household but also the savings of other households. The results suggested that, assuming
constant income, the prospect of an inheritance could increase consumption; that is, while the
elderly person might not be spending savings, there could be a reduction of savings in a
younger generation in expectation of receiving an inheritance.
        Lee et al. (2000) attempt to explain the marked increase in the savings rate in Taiwan
in the second half of the 20th century. Using a simulation model, the authors argue that the
answer to the phenomenon is the dramatic increase in life expectancy, which requires funding
a longer period of retirement. Subsequent studies using panel data corroborated these findings
for various countries: Bloom et al. (2003), who note the exception that while the rate of
savings among all ages may be increasing, decades of growth in the proportion of elderly
people may cause a reduction in aggregate savings; and Kinugasa and Mason (2007), who
argue that the gains in savings due to people's increasing life expectancy are much higher than
the gains due to the smaller proportion of young dependents.
        Thus, Mason and Lee (2006) define the period which the demographic transition
contributes to an increase in savings as the second demographic bonus. In turn, Bloom et al.
(2007) argue that longer life expectancy affects savings only in countries whose social
security systems are capitalized but would not apply to countries that adopt a system of
simple distribution, as is the case of Brazil. As the authors note, this is because the system of
simple distribution reduces individuals' concern for saving enough to support themselves in
their old age.
        Nonetheless, Neri, Carvalho and Nascimento (1999) used a qualitative study
conducted by the Brazilian Credit and Savings Association (Associação Brasileira de Crédito
e Poupança - Abecip) in 1996 that aimed to examine the process of accumulation and
dissipation of financial wealth over the life cycle, especially the need for assets in old age.
The main reason for savings among the Brazilian elderly is precaution, with almost half of
savers wanting to be prepared for any emergencies. Among young people, the most cited
reason for saving was to accumulate funds for the future, which is consistent with the life
cycle hypothesis. Finally, the habit of saving to ensure the future of the next generation was
not found, indicating that the occasional inheritances left to family in the Brazilian context
were unexpected rather than planned. Still in the Brazilian case, Stampe (2013) estimates that,
with population aging, consumption declines in some sectors, but grows in others, making
overall consumption stable at more advanced ages.
                                                                                                   4

3. Methodology

        The economic definition of savings is the difference between income and
consumption. However, it is difficult to apply this concept using the HBS data, as some part
of each individual's consumption occurs within the household, making it impossible to arrive
at an exact calculation of each individual family member's savings. Therefore, an initial
estimate of savings and dissavings was arrived at by examining financial investments and
withdrawals, including savings accounts, fixed income funds, bank Certificates of Deposit,
stock holdings and private pension funds. Those who invest sums greater than their
withdrawals are assumed to be savers, while those who withdraw more than they invest are
classified as dissavers.
        Because this study focuses on individuals' private savings, another challenge faced is
how to treat the acquisition of real estate, as many people consider the purchase of a primary
home as a form of savings for retirement. Thus, a second scenario included in the category of
savers those individuals who invested more in the purchase of homes and land than the total
value of real estate property sold, while those who reduced the total value of their real estate
holdings were considered dissavers.
       Finally, a third and final scenario combined the first two, taking into account both
financial transactions and real estate dealings. That is, savers were defined as individuals
whose combined financial investments and real estate purchases exceeded their combined
financial withdrawals and real estate sales.
       Thus, in the first scenario (considering only financial transactions), micro-data of the
Household Budget Survey (HBS) were used to calculate the sum of the investments and
withdrawals made over the past 12 months by individual , with the financial balance for the
period given by the following equation:

                                                                           .                 (1)

       The dependent variable is given, then, by the following classification for each
individual:
       If             , the individual was a saver over the past 12 months (category Saver),
 If               , the individual was a dissaver over the past 12 months (category Dissaver),
  If               , the individual was neither a saver nor a dissaver over the past 12 months
                                        (category NSND).

        It is important to underscore that according to the classification above, an individual
whose total deposits and total withdrawals were equal would have a balance of zero. For
example, someone who invested R$ 1,000 in stocks and withdrew R$ 1,000 from a savings
account has zero balance, being neither a saver nor a dissaver (NSND). On the other hand,
someone who invested R$ 1,000 in a bank CD and withdrew R$ 800 from a savings account
is considered a saver because the balance is positive.
        In the second scenario (real estate acquisition), the method is very similar, as it is also
possible to identify the amounts spent and received in the real estate market over the last 12
months through the HBS, including both financed purchases and cash transactions. However,
this case presents an extra wrinkle, as the purchase or sale of a primary residence appears in
the HBS as a collective transaction, making it impossible to attribute the acquisition or sale to
a specific family member or members. It is therefore assumed that the acquisition or sale of
the property is conducted only by the head of household and that person's spouse (if
                                                                                             5

applicable), dividing the value of the property proportionally according to the total income of
these two family members. Finally, in the third scenario, which includes both financial and
real estate transactions, the balance is derived simply by summing the other two scenarios.
       Once the three categories (Saver, Dissaver and NSND) had been established for each
scenario (financial, real estate and total transactions), a multinomial logit model was
constructed, according to the equation below:

                                                (       )
                               (       )                             .                     (2)
                                           ∑        (       )


       Where (         ) is the probability of individual be of category – assign 1 for the
Saver category and 2 for the dissaving category, while NSND is the reference category 0 –,
is the matrix of characteristics of individuals and       is the vector of parameters to be
estimated.

       We can thus estimate, for each age, the probability that an individual is a saver or a
dissaver. In the present work, the matrix      was estimated using age and age squared as
regressors. In addition, in one of the sections of results, the estimates were tested with the
presence of control variables of socioeconomic, educational and demographic characteristics,
which, when employed, assigned the national averages for the calculations of probability.


4. Results

       An initial descriptive analysis (Table 1) shows that between 1995/1996 and
2002/2003, there was an increase in the proportion of savers in both the financial scenario
(from 5.6% to 6.2%) and the real estate scenario (from 0.9% to 1.4%), while between
2002/2003 and 2008/2009, the number of savers declined in the financial scenario (from 6.2%
to 5.7%) but continued to grow in the real estate scenario (from 1.4% to 1.7%). So, adding the
financial and real estate scenarios, the percentage of savers rose from its 1995/1996 level of
6.2% to reach 7.3% in 2002/2003, then declined to 7.0% during the final period.
       It is possible that the explanation for this decline in the number of savers between
2002/2003 and 2008/2009 lies in the economic context, considering that the 2008-2009 HBS
was conducted during a global economic crisis to which the Brazilian government responded
by stimulating consumption through tax reductions and public spending, while household
income fell (TCU, 2009). Although the POF 2002-2003 was also collected in a period of
uncertainties, when the election for the first term of former President Lula took place.
       Table 1 also shows that in all the scenarios and all the periods analyzed, those who had
depleted their savings over the previous 12 months had a higher mean age than those who had
added to their savings. The savers, in turn, are older than those who were neither savers nor
dissavers.
        A simple analysis of the sample averages indicates that younger people are less likely
to engage in financial and real estate transactions, the reasons for which will be explored in
more detail in the following subsections. Moreover, the fact that dissavers are older than
savers in all the periods and scenarios confirms the suspicion that the demographic transition
could have an impact on the net difference between savers and dissavers.

       In the next two subsections, multinomial logit models are used to more accurately
measure the effects of age on an individual's propensity to save. First, estimates of the
propensity to save or dissave are calculated for each of the three scenarios without using
control variables, that is, a real scenario of the ages most and least likely to save in Brazil.
       In the second subsection, however, control variables are used in an effort to
understand how the propensity to save or dissave by age would behave if variables such as
income, educational level, gender, etc., are held constant.

4.1. Results without the use of controls

       Table 2 shows the estimates of the multinomial logit model coefficients for the three
scenarios, using only age and age squared as explanatory variables and NSND as the
reference category. It can be seen that in all scenarios and periods, both the odds ratio of being
a "Saver" and the odds ratio of being a "Dissaver", in relation to being an NSND, have an
association with age that appears as an open-bottom parabola because the coefficients are
positive for age and negative for age-squared, indicating that there is a maximum point in
both bases. It is also worth noting the relative similarity among the coefficients in all three
periods studied.

       By transforming the coefficients, as described in Section 3, we can calculate the
estimated probability that an individual will be a saver or dissaver, given his or her age, as
shown in Figure 1. The probability of saving remains fairly stable during the periods studied
in both the financial scenario (with a peak of 54 years in 2008/2009) and the real estate
scenario (where the age of greatest propensity for savings was 43 in the final period).
        In contrast, the likelihood of dissaving, which always reaches its high point at an older
age than that of the likelihood of saving, occurs increasingly later over the years (with the
exception being in the financial scenario between 2002/2003 and 2008/2009). Thus, in the
final period, the highest point occurred at the age of 69 years in the financial scenario, at the
age of 59 years in the real estate scenario, and at the age of 69 years in the scenario that
combined financial and real estate transactions.
       As a result, the net difference between the two probabilities in the scenario that
combines financial and real estate transactions has also advanced over the periods, rising from
41 to 42, and later to 44 years of age. This figure deserves particular attention in the analysis
because it represents the net effect of new savers. For example, if in every 100 individuals at
age , eight are savers and five are dissavers, the net balance is three additional savers.

        According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de
Geografia e Estatística - IBGE) (2013), the mean age of the population between 16 and 90
years was 41 in 2015; it is increasing and expected to reach 45 in 2030, as shown in Figure 2.
Thus, because the probability of saving in both scenarios (financial + real estate) reached its
maximum at 44 years in 2008/2009, with a tendency to rise from one survey to the next, there
are indications that, at least until 2030, the population structure should contribute to a rise in
the percentage of savers, as Bloom (2010) has also observed.
        In fact, the projections for 2045, with a mean age of 49 years, could also represent a
positive contribution to private savings because the age for maximum savings may be higher,
as the trend shows. Only in 2060, when the mean age reaches 52 years and a large percentage
of the population is elderly, if the trend continues, would the demographic structure contribute
negatively to the number of savers.

4.2. Results with the use of controls

        The previous subsection demonstrated that in the three periods examined, there is a
quadratic relationship between age and the net difference in the probabilities of saving and
dissaving, in keeping with the life cycle hypothesis: people tend to save less during their
youth, save most during adulthood, and then save less again after they pass that age.
However, if everyone, regardless of age, had the same income, level of education, gender,
etc., would this relationship change?
        To answer this question, the present subsection recalculated the same dependent
variable, but with the following controls: the logarithm of the individual's annual income, the
logarithm of household income per capita, number of household members, years of education,
gender and two dummies (whether the person is a civil servant or an employee of a private
company). Table 3 shows the estimated coefficients using the multinomial logit model.

        Carrying out the same transformation performed in the previous subsection and
attributing the national average to the control variables, we can calculate the probability that a
person is a saver or dissaver, given the person's age. Figure 3 shows a marked change in
behavior in the financial scenario, in that the net difference between the probabilities is
greater in the youngest age group. In other words, if young people had the same income and
other characteristics as people in the more mature group, they would be the group with the
greatest difference between savers and dissavers.
        In the real estate scenario, however, the analysis changes, returning to the maximum
points for savers, dissavers and net differences. This means that even when all the controls are
in place, there would be a middle age group, consisting of people between 34 and 44 years of
                                                                                             11

age, with greater propensity to purchase or sell real estate, with the net difference peaking at
33 years old.
        The results of this section show that young people would show a high propensity to
save if their other characteristics resembled those of older generations. The explanation for
this probably lies in their long life expectancy and their desire to maintain an appropriate
standard of living throughout the entire period.

5. Conclusions

        For all three periods analyzed, the results found for savings in the financial scenario
and in the combined financial scenarios and real estate scenarios are consistent with the cycle
of life hypothesis. When no control variables are used, the propensity to save is small among
young people, increases among mature adults and declines again in old age. The main cause
of a low savings rate among young people is that their needs are greater than their income,
while older people deplete the savings they accumulated during their adult lives in order to
maintain their pattern of consumption over their lifespan.
        When control variables such as income are introduced, this hypothesis is strengthened,
as young people would become the biggest savers if they had the same characteristics as
individuals of other ages. In other words, young people save less not as a matter of choice but
due to their high needs and their budget constraints. Elderly people, on the other hand, are less
likely to save, even when control variables are introduced, once again corroborating the life
cycle hypothesis.
        Without the use of controls, the three periods showed very similar results in the
financial scenario. The age at which individuals' propensity to save peaked varied between 53
and 52 years old in the first two household budget surveys and reached 54 years old in the
final survey. The net difference increased by slightly more, from 39 to 44, and finally to 46
years of age, while the probability of the points of maximum probability remained around
10% in all three surveys. These results are similar to the conclusions reached by Bloom et al.
(2007), who show that the effect of longer life expectancy on savings is very small in
countries where the pension system is based on simple distribution.
        Although the elderly have a lower propensity to save, there are indications that, at least
for the next several decades, the aging of the population should increase the number of savers
because the largest segment of Brazil's population structure is still approaching the age at
which individuals are most likely to save. However, as Bloom et al. (2010) have also shown,
beyond that point, the large number of elderly individuals is expected to weigh negatively on
the number of net savers.
