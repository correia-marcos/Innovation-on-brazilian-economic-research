            The Brazilian Electricity Sector adopted the auction mechanism to allocate Power Transmis-
        sion assets. The auctions’ results are impacted by interdependence and the capacity constraint.
        We develop a theoretical model to evaluate these issues in a procurement auction sequence.
        The theoretical model shows that the joint action of interdependence and of capacity restriction
        decreases the competitiveness of the participants and the payoff of auctioneers. Using Switch-
        ing Regression models and Quantile Regressions, we found that the interdependence affected
        the probability of winning and the behavior of the bidding. We suggest policies based in the
        achieved results.

1         Introduction
Repeated auctions can be affected by synergies between objects and by bidders suffering of capacity
constraint. We study how these issues, acting together, are affecting procurement auctions for Power
Transmission contracts in Brazil. In this industry, operating and maintaining structures in the same
region can be a economy of scale opportunity, leading to synergies between contracts. Despite that,
building complex facilities requires the allocation of significant amount of resources and additional
contracts during this phase can lead to higher costs.
     Although these two issues have been analyzed in different industries, the Brazilian Power Trans-
mission Sector (BPTS) has two particular characteristics that can emphasize the effects and requires
further investigation: First the industry complexity and high investments can reduce entry; Second
the participation of big public companies in the competition. Furthermore, the raising number of
failures in the sector’s auction can clearly be a result of a miss-inclusion of these effects on the
regulator actions and policies.
     In the following section of this paper we describe the BPTS setting and the results of previous
auctions. In section 3 we propose a theoritical model for the analyzed problem. In section 4 we model
these effects in the BPTS setting to understand possible consequences to the industry. In section 5
we empirically assess the interdependency and the capacity constraints effects in the BPTS setting.
Section 6 concludes the study.


2         Brazilian transmission auctions
During the 90s wave of restructuring the electricity sector, Brazil decided for the vertical separation
of power generation, transmission and distribution. In the same period, the electricity regulatory
agency - ANEEL was created and entitled to promote public tenders for contracting services on the
three areas. For the power transmission sector, the ANEEL introduced a hybrid auction to allocate
contracts for building, operating and maintenance the transmission facilities.
     The pay-as-bid auction has two stages, a sealed and an open one. In the first phase, the
companies submit a closed financial bid of how much it requires for the service, which must be lower
than the maximum allowed revenue (RAP) set by the regulator. All bids are revealed after all offers
are placed and the lowest offer wins. The second-phase auction only happens if there is at least one
bid in a 5% range from the best one. In the open stage, bids start from the first phase best offer and
finishes when no company wants to lower the currently best offer. The winner then submits a power
transmission project and signs an 30 year contract.
    To minimize monitoring difficulties and costs, the regulator checks quality and deadlines during
the building phase. Furthermore, during the operation phase, the contracted company is punished
in case of power transmission failures, and the fine is proportional to interruptions reasons and
duration1 .
     If the company does not suffer from interruptions its revenue is constant and equal the winner
bid value. During the concession length, the regulator reviews this revenue each 5 years utilizing the
discounted cash flow procedures and accounting for the weighted average capital cost2 .
     According to EPE (2015) by 2014 the country had more than 111.000 KM of power lines and
133.000 MW of installed capacity. Its length is justified by the power generation model, that highly
relies on hydro power, usually located far from the cities.

     To accommodate consumption expansion the regulator holds several auctions every year. In
average 4.060 km of power lines are contracted per year, enhancing the system reliability. The peak
of contracting was 2008, when over 10.000km of power lines was auctioned. The consistent expansion
pattern resulted in more than 60.000 km power lines contracted since 2001. The figure 1 shows the
contracted extension length by year.

    It is noticeable an pattern of aggressive bidding in the Brazilian auctions. For instance, in 2007
the average discount on the Revenue Cap reached 55%, while the biggest discount was 60% and
happened in 2008. The Figure 2 shows the discounts and the number of offered contracts evolution
along the years.
     Francelino & Polito (2007) accounts the high level of discounts to the higher competition level,
especially coming from Spanish companies. According to the author, there are several reasons for
this aggressive behavior, but the main are the easy access to credit and tax benefits.
     Castro (2006) shows a model to explain the growing discounts: they are related to the country
risk reduction, that’s it, with the perception of investment risk in country by foreigners investors. Yet,
according to the author, that’s not enough to explain the aggressive behavior on the transmission
auctions: the optimism created by the easy access to credit by the National Development Bank
(BNDES) and financial markets should be taken in account.
     In a different assessment Hirota (2006) evaluates that the transmission sector has been affected
by the interdependency between the already installed facilities and the objects being auctioned.
According to the author, a transmission line that’s going to be build in an area that already has
transmission facilities can benefit from scale gains, ”as the transmission company won’t need to build
new facilities or do new environmental studies, lowering the cost and raising the project value”. In
this way, the existent economy scale creates an interdependency effect among transmission contracts
and affects bidding.
     Tozei et al. (2014) analyze the effects of consortia participation on the average bid and discount
in the BTA. They claim that consortia were less competitive than individual firms, offering higher
bids/ lower discounts for the projects. Carlos & Saraiva (2008) highlights that the interdependency
comes from economy scale in jointly operating and managing nearby transmission facilities. The
authors also shows that this effect is relevant in companies bid strategy and that interdependent
objects auctions tend to have more aggressive bidding behavior.

     Ausubel et al. (1997) analyzed auctions for communication services with the intention to identify
the impact of geographic synergies on its closing prices. The author observes that besides the capacity
constraints, synergy effects conduct closing prices to higher levels when the second best bidder has
connected licenses.
     The Brazilian Transmission Auctions (BTA) allow companies to partner and bid as a consortia,
thereby companies may decide to join a group to, among other reasons, reduce the effects of its own
capacity constraints. Nevertheless, Tozei et al. (2014) claims that in average consortia participation
are not related to more aggressive bids when compared to individual firms.
     We define backlog as the number of not finalized projects, in a specific date, hold by a company.
Our hypothesis is that bidders are accounting for projects not finalized in the day the new project
is supposed to start, not the numbers of projects in the day of the auction. Figure ?? shows the
average number of submitted bids per auction in each year. We grouped bidders by the following
backlog intervals: [0, 4], [5, 9],[10, 15].
     Until 2007 all bidders have maximum of 4 projects in execution, from 2008 companies with at
least 5 projects start participating more often and represent a significant part of the total number of
bids, representing almost 50% in the first auction of 2015. Moreover, between 2009 and 2013 even
companies with more than 10 participated in the auction.
     Figure3 presents the number of projects won by companies in categories of backlog level. The
figure shows that, despite the small participation rate, companies with more than 5 unfinished
projects won several projects, overcoming companies with less than 5 projects in 2009, 2011, and
2012.
      Serrato (2006) utilizes a Frontier Production Model and ANEEL’s restricted data from 1997 to
2005 to analyze efficiency in the Brazilian Transmission Sector. The author claims that although in
average firms get more efficient over time, the older companies (mostly state companies) are more
efficient in terms of costs than the newer companies. Furthermore, the new companies are more
efficient in costs related to management but presents higher fixed costs, which are related to financial
costs. The author, also affirms that while older and newer companies have proportionally the same
total cost related to the infrastructure, the relative size of the companies is not related to its efficiency.
They also concludes that firms that operates in smaller areas are more efficient.

    It is worth mentioning that Serrato reinforces the presence of the two analyzed effects on the
BTA: the relative inefficiency of newer companies can be related to (financial) capacity constraint;
and the efficiency gains prompted by the operation of nearby and interdependent infrastructure.


3    Interdependency and capacity constraint
According to Pitchik & Schotter (1988), in sequential auctions, objects can be interdependent. It
can occur due to complementarity and capacity constraint. To Gandal (1997), sequential auction
can be divided in distinct parts, auctions of independent value units and interdependent value. For
the former, the unit value is not related to previous added units, while it is related for the second.
    Krishna (2002) separates multiple auctions units by identical and not identical object units.
According to him, identical units are perfect substitutes, while not identical can be substitutes or
complements. The object is substitute if the marginal value of acquiring an additional object ”A” is
smaller the bigger the previously acquired objects set ”B”. So,

                                     xi (A ∪ B) < xi (A) + xi (B)


                                where xi : Marginal value of agent i .

     Ashenfelter & Genesove (1992) analyzed identical units results in condominium units auctions
and compared to negotiation results. They found that prices decreases with the number of auctioned
units and after auction negotiated units reaches lower prices. The same pattern was identified by
Ashenfelter (1989) analyzing wine auctions.
    More recently, Reiss & Schondube (2010) study a first price sequential auction of independent

                                                  5
objects in which competitors face capacity constraint. They identified a pattern of equivalence
between commercialized object prices and auctioned values.
    Some works analyze the objects complementarity and its effect on the prices trend. Gandal
(1997) verified the interdependency existence in sequential auctions for cable TV licenses in Israel.
The author claims that due to economies of scale, bids for the last auctions tend to be more aggressive.
Ausubel et al. (1997) analyzed auctions for communication services on the intention to identify the
impact of geographic synergies on its closing prices. The author observes that although capacity
constraints, synergy effects conduct closing prices to higher levels when the second best bidder has
connected licenses.
    Some works evaluate the synergy existence in the Brazilian transmission auctions. Motta &
Ramos (2011) conclude that the existence of interdependency between objects, associated with the
competition level, is the growing discounts reason. Carlos & Saraiva (2008) and Hirota (2006) also
concluded on the existence of interdependency between objects in the transmission auction.
     The literature indicates that the complementarity between objects affect the prices trend. As
the marginal value of acquiring an object is higher when the agent already owns a related object, the
later auctioned objects have higher closing prices than former ones and the bids are more aggressive
when sequential auctions gets closer to its end. On the other hand, the capacity constraint has the
opposite effect on price trend, as a significant part of resources were applied in the first object.
     Jofre-Bonet & Pesendorfer (2003) assess results of repeated auctions of highway contracts in
California. They evaluate if the existence of an ongoing contract can affect the company capacity
of winning new contracts. According to the authors as the building contract duration can last for
months, winning a contract means allocate resources while the construction lasts. In this way the
presence of inter-temporal capacity constraint reduce the available resources and then reduces the
competitor chance of winning new contracts.
     Silva (2005) examines road construction procurement auctions and finds that bidders with syn-
ergies have higher participating probability and tend to bid more aggressively. Also, firms capacity
unconstrained tend to bid more aggressively than one that is capacity constrained.
    Saini & Suter (2015) utilizes experiments to assess bidding behavior in a sequential procurement
auction where bidders suffers from capacity constraint. They find that bidders account for capacity
constraint effects but they underestimate its magnitude.
     The power transmission contract requires the winner company to build, maintain and operate
the transmission facility. The power lines and substation construction can request the following steps:
topography and environment study, deforestation and area cleaning, land and rock excavation, and
construction. These activities shows the need of specialized machinery and labor, which can be source
of capacity constraint. Also, the contract set specific schedules for the construction and operation
start, varying from 18 to 36 months.
    These contracts characteristic allow the bidding strategies to be affected by capacity constraint.
     In sequential auctions of not identical objects the interdependency and capacity constrains, when
acting together, affects more than prices trend. The competitor may have to choose what auctions
to participate as each object can reflect in different capacity constraint and interdependency effects.
Also, not competing for a contract can allow opponents to be more competitive in later rounds,
reducing the winning probability.

4         Theoretical model
Here we model the procurement sequential auction of complementary objects. We utilize the perfect
information hyphotesys. The interdependency of the objects act in a way that for any bidder j, its
evaluation x of the objects A and B is such that

                                              xj (A ∪ B) > xj (A) + xj (B)

    This relation means that the marginal value of adding an object A to a set B is larger than the
value of the object when considered in separate.
     For a procurement auction, the object’s complementarity can emerge from economy scale reasons.
So, the bigger the number of interdependent objects (I), the lower the object marginal cost of adding
another object. For simplification, we consider the cost as a function of I, C(I), such that

                                     dC                d2 C
                                        <0                  >0   C(I) > C(I + 1)                   (1)
                                     dI                dI 2
     The bidder j maximize the expected payoff πe = (Bj − Cj )P (Bj < B−j ), where Bj is its own
bid, B−j is the opponent bid and Cj is the cost. The auctioneer reserve price is R, so B ≤ R.


4.1         Auctions of three objects under interdependence
In this first game we consider two risk neutral identical bidders, J = 2, and three complementary
objects (N = 3)3 with identical auctioneer reserve price R. The game state Z represents the number
of objects operated by each bidder (the interdependency level). We start with the initial state
Z = {0, 0}.

    1. We start assessing what’s the biggest excedent a competitor could achieve in this three objects
       auction. Suppose player 1 adopts strategy B1 = C(0) −  while player 2 bids B2 = C2 . The
       auction result is

          Round 1
          J1 : C1 = C(0) → B1 = C(0) −  → π1 = ([C(0) − ] − C(0)) = −
          J2 : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(0) → π2 = 0

          Round 2
          J1 : C1 = C(1) → B1 = C(0) −  → π1 = ([C(0) − ] − C(1)) > 0
          J2 : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(0) → π2 = 0

          Round 3
          J1 : C1 = C(2) → B1 = C(0) −  → π1 = ([C(0) − ] − C(2)) > 0
          J2 : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(0) → π2 = 0

      π1 = 2C(0) − C(1) − C(2) − 3 > 0,         π2 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0


  2. We now analyze the game utilizing backwards induction. In the last round, supposing player 1
     won the two previous stages, the best bid player 2 can do is bidding its own cost. In reaction
     to that, player 1 should bid its adversary cost minus . The resulting auction is
      Round 3
      J1 : C1 = C(2) → B1 = C(0) − ] → π1 = C(0) − C(2) − 
      J2 : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(0) → π2 = 0

      Round 2
      Facing a two auctions object ahead, against an competitor with interdependency, the best a
      player can do is to bid its own cost. Let’s imagine that it bids lower than its cost and wins the
      game. In the third round, it is going to compete in equal forces, and the result is an auction
      where both player bid its costs. So, the player cannot recover the discount made in the previous
      round and its final payoff is negative.
      Then, in the second round the player won’t bid any value lower than its own cost, while the
      one who has interdependency bids just  below the adversary’s cost,
      J1 : C1 = C(1) → B1 = C(0) − ] → π1 = C(0) − C(1) − 
      J2 : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(0) → π1 = 0

      Round 1
      Under this setting, the game is reduced to winning the first round, as the winner will have
      advantages for the next rounds. The most aggressive strategy that can be utilized is to discount
      the potential next rounds gains in the first round bid. So,
      J1 : C1 = C(0) → B1 = C(0) − [2C(0) − C(1) − C(2) − 2] = C(1) + C(2) + 2
      J2 : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(0) − [2C(0) − C(1) − C(2) − 2] = C(1) + C(2) + 2

      Suppose player 1 is drawn,
      π1 = C(1) + C(2) − 2C(0) + 2 < 0,        π2 = 0

      Final Payoff

      π1 = 0,      π2 = 0


    In the first round bidders are induced to offer all gains that can be reached in the following
rounds due to interdependency. This way, as in the two objects case, all the excedent is captured by
the auctioneer, due to the high level competition. Also, a growing bid pattern is verified along the
rounds.


4.2    Interdependency and capacity constraint
The game we develop now is an expansion adding the hypothesis that bidder face inter-temporal
capacity constraint. It means that winning an object, the player faces a cost rise in the following

                                                  8
                                                                                            ∂C
round. We now consider that players cost is a function Ci = h(Int, Cap) such that          ∂Int
                                                                                                  < 0 e
 ∂C
∂Cap
     > 0.
     So while interdependency reduces costs, the capacity constraint raises it. Also, the factors have
different duration. While interdependency lasts during all auction rounds, the capacity constraint
affects just the next round.


4.3    Extreme high capacity constraint
We begin assessing the game when the capacity constraint is extremely high, such that in the round
following the win the player’s cost is equal to the auctioneer reserve price, so for that round Ci = R.

  1. Let’s assess the three objects game strategy equilibrium, with initial state Z = {0, 0}.
      In this game, players know that the first round winner is in disadvantage in the second round
      but in advantage in the third. If she wins the first round, will be capacity constrained in the
      second and the adversary wins. In the third, though, she is in a favorable position as the
      adversary is under constraint and she has interdependency.
      Due to that, players want to bid stronger in the first round and recover the discount in the
      last round. If the discount is too large though, it can be more interesting to stick just with
      the second round. Players will increase the discount until the point where they’re indifferent
      between objects 1 and 3 or just object 2.
      Round 3
      J1 : C1 = C(1) → B1 = R −  → π1 = R −  − C(1)
      J2 : C2 = R → B1 = R → π2 = 0

      Round 2
      J1 : C1 = R → B1 = R → π1 = 0
      J2 : C2 = C(0) → B1 = R −  → π2 = R −  − C(0)

      Round 1
      J1 : C1 = C(0) → B1 = C(0) − [C(0) − C(1)] = C(1)
      J2 : C2 = C(0) → B1 = C(0) − [C(0) − C(1)] = C(1)

      Suppose player 1 is drawn
      π1 = C(1) − C(0) < 0,       π2 = 0

4.4    Moderate capacity constraint
  1. Consider that players costs are a function of the Interdependency (I) and Capacity Constraint
     (T) such that C(I, T ) = c(γI − µT ), for γ, µ ≥ 1, 0 < c < 1. The case where µ < γ can
     be interpreted as a reduction of the interdependency effect, in a way that it would be fully
     effective just after a period of time. If it is the case that µ = γ then we can also understand it
     as a delayed interdependency effect.
      Although one could say capacity constraint have minor effects on costs or that the impact degree
      depends on the firms size, this model seeks to assess the situation where capacity constraint is
      a strong effect and can reduce bidders competitiveness for some time period. So, considering
      µ > γ represents the situation where winning an object will make the bidder less competitive
      than its opponent, even if only for a round.
      Here we suppose that capacity constraint raises competitors costs in two ”degrees”, while
      interdependency lower costs in one ”degree”, so µ = 2 and γ = 1.

  The smaller capacity constraint reduces the competition degree, allowing the auctioneer to reach
  larger excedents. The 2 Degrees case is associated to lower competitors payoffs, in comparison
  when capacity constraint is higher.


2. Let’s now assess the game with three objects and two competitor where one holds an in-
   terdependent object. Suppose player 1 is low cost L and player 2 is high H, Z = {1, 0},
   C(I, T ) = c(γI − µT ) where µ = 2 and γ = 1. To solve this game, let’s also suppose L
   wins the first round. If it happens, in the second round, costs are equal between agents,
   CL = c(1(1 + 1) − 2(1)) and CH = C(0).

     • In case L also wins round 2, we have the following on the third
       Round 3
       JL : C1 = C(1) → B1 = C(0) −  → π1 = C(0) −  − C(1) > 0
       JH : C2 = C(0) → B1 = C(0) → π2 = 0

     • In case L loses the second round, the third is
       Round 3
       JL : C1 = C(2) → B1 = C(−1) −  → π1 = C(−1) −  − C(2) > 0
       JH : C2 = C(−1) → B1 = C(−1) → π2 = 0


  As payoff is bigger in the second case, the type ”L” agent just wants to win the round 2 in case
  it can be at least as good as when she loses second round and wins the third. So, if second
  round payoff in case of victory is X, then x + C(0) −  − C(1) ≥ C(−1) −  − C(2). So, L is
  indifferent between scenarios when x = C(−1) + C(1) − C(2) − C(0).
  Due to that, type L player lowest bid in the second round is C(−1) + C(1) − C(2). As player
  H’s has payoff zero in both cases, she is indifferent and has lowest bid equal to its cost C(0).
  As L has a ”higher lowest bid”, the second round is
  Round 2
  JL : C1 = C(0) → B1 = C(−1) + C(1) − C(2) → π1 = 0
  JH : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(−1) + C(1) − C(2) −  → π2 = C(−1) + C(1) − C(2) −  − C(0) > 0

  So, player H wins Round 2.
  The same assessment is made for the case where L loses the first round:

     • In case L wins round 2
       Round 3
       JL : C1 = C(0) → B1 = C(0) → π1 = 0
       JH : C2 = C(1) → B2 = C(0) −  → π2 = C(0) −  − C(1) > 0




                                             11
        • In case L loses round 2
          Round 3
          JL : C1 = C(2) → B1 = C(0) −  → π1 = C(0) −  − C(1) > 0
          JH : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(0) → π2 = 0


     As the cases are symmetric, both require the same payoff on the second round π = C(0) −
      − C(1). In spite to that, players costs are different, requiring different bids to achieve such
     minimum payoff.
     Minimum Bid
     JL : C(0) −  − C(1) + C(1)
     JH : C(0) −  − C(1) + C(−1)

     As C(−1) > C(1), we have
     Round 2
     JL : C1 = C(0) → B1 = C(0) −  − C(1) + C(−1) → π1 = C(0) − 2 − 2C(1) + C(−1)
     JH : C2 = C(0) → B2 = C(0) −  − C(1) + C(−1) −  → π2 = 0

     So, player L wins second round.
     Closing this assessment let’s check the bidders lowest bid in first round.

5    Empirical
In this section we quantitatively assess the effects of interdependency and capacity constraint acting
together on the Brazilian transmission auctions.
     As suggested by Rocha et al. (2013) the selection between winner and losers is endogenous,
resulting in a bias when estimating an OLS due to non observable variables that turns a bid winner.
      The bid can be explained by non observable variables as information asymmetry, company’s
efficiency, interdependency, etc. These non observable effects are revealed when its bid is the winner.
One approach to deal with this situation is to admit that those variables won’t change the relation
between the independent variables and the bid, what would imply in heterogeneity between winner
and loser coefficients Rocha et al. (2013).

    In the transmission auction, the regulator reveals all the bids, but it is only observable in
the different states: winner or loser. This setup can be handled by the Roy Model, also called
Switching Regression Model by Maddala (1983) and Tobit type 5 model by Amemiya (1985).
                             0                                                              0        0
     Using this procedure, x1 are the winning probability explanatory variables, while x2 and x3
explain bids in the winners group (w = 1) and losers group (w = 0), respectively. In this exercise we
utilize bidder characteristics as explanatory variables for the winning probability while both bidder
and auction characteristics to explain bidding.

     The auctioneer Revenue Cap (RC) is likely to be the most important variable to explain bids.
In a procurement auction it works as an upper bound for the bid. Specifically for the Brazilian trans-
mission auction, the Reserve Price is estimated by making the Net Present Value of the investment
cash flow goes to zero. Doing that, the investment return is equal to the Weighted Average Capital
Cost (WACC), what reflects the average cost of different financing alternatives in the market. The
investment cash flow considers among other the initial investment to build the transmission structure,
the land usage costs and the projects development.
     Although the reserve price already accounts for variables market indicators, we also include on
our database variables like the Long Run Interest Rate (T JLP ), Brazil-risk (EM BI + BR), and the
relation between the RevenueCap by the Estimated Investment.
     As object characteristics we include location, extension and number of substations. The last
two variables directly impacts the necessary investment requested by the object. The longer is the
line extension the higher are the costs with cables, towers and land while substations are related to
expensive equipments.

                                                 13
    Each Brazilian region can affect investments and maintenance costs differently due to economic
and geographic reasons. The North region is known for presence of the very dense Amazon forest
what requires high equipment transportation costs due to location access difficulties. The region, as
the South-East, can also be hardly affected by lightning and strong wind storms. Also, the South
and South-East due to higher population density can have more costly land.
     As a auction environment variable, we have the number of registered companies, what refers to
the companies that have attended to some requirements previously made by the auctioneer. Although
all those registered companies are allowed to bid in the auction, not all actually do bid. For some
reason, companies may decide not to bid. The number companies that are registered and bid in the
auction are called by (Num˙Bid ). While the winning probability is directed affected by Num˙Bid, it
should not be affected by the Num˙Regist as the companies may not actually bid. On the other way,
as all companies bid simultaneously, the Num˙Regist seems to be more important for bid estimation.
     For bidder personal information we utilize dummies variables indicating if the company is state-
owned (State = 1) or foreign (F oreign = 1). The Interdependence level (Interdependency) is defined
as the sum of contracts held by the company, in the specific region the object will be build. This
variable works as a proxy for the economy of scale that can be provided by the structures in operation.
     The player may adjust its strategy when playing against a competitor that is stronger or weaker
than himself. To account for this adjustments we created a variable that measures the difference in
the Interdependence Level. The Diff Interdependency is calculated as a difference of interdependency
levels: the player and its opponent with higher interdependence level (among the opponents registered
to compete for the object).
    When in a disadvantage situation the bidder may want to bid even harder if it’s competing
against a high Interdependency level company. On the opposite situation, when competing against
weaker opponents the bidder may not want to bid too strong.
     Silva (2005) and Jofre-bonet & Pesendorfer (2000) defends that as the number of projects under
construction grows the firm may suffer from a capacity constraint, i.e. it may be less competitive
as a bigger part of its resources are in use. The Backlog variable counts the number of projects in
execution hold by a bidder, as a proxy for the capacity constraint faced by the firm in the auction.
     While operating contracts can add competitiveness to the bidder, it is possible that having mul-
tiple projects in the building stage can decrease bidder competitiveness due to Capacity Constraint.
To evaluate this effect, Backlog counts the number of projects, in the building phase, the company
will hold on the date the contract it is competing for is supposed to start.
     A possible way to get away from Backlog effects is by setting partnership with other companies
to share responsibilities. For this reason, we also utilize a dummy variable for the situation where
the bidder is actually a Consortia (Consortia) of companies4 .
    We proceed estimation for two different variables, the Bid (Bid) value and the relative discount
(Disc) between the RevenueCap and the Bid. While the first represents how much the company is
accepting the contract, the second is a government measure of how much it saved by auctioning the
object.
     Before running the Switching regression model, we present OLS estimation for the log(bid)
in Table 2. The model (1) presents the estimations without the use of controls other than the
log(Investment), which is highly significant in all estimations. For that model, the coefficient of the
interdependency is significant while the backlog one is not. In model (2), with the addition of the
Year controls, both coefficients are reported significant at 1% level. As expected, the interdependency
coefficient is negative and the backlog is positive.

     In the third model, we control for the contract Region, the Auction, Contracts specif ics as the
line extension and the number of substations, the Company type, and Macroeconomics variables as
the Long Run Interest rate and the nation risk index. The estimated coefficients for the interdepen-
dency and backlog are higher and still significant at 1% level. The model (4) adds the Difference of
Interdependency to the control set, although it seems to not affect much the coefficient estimates.
     The model (5) is distinct from the model (4) due to the remotion of the auction fixed control.
Comparing the two models, we can verify that the coefficients of Interdependency and CapacityConstraint
don’t change significantly. By doing that we connect the estimated models with the model (6), that
use the same set of controls as model (5).
     The model (6) in Table 2 utilizes an adaptation of the procedure proposed by Silva (2005). The
author tests for the existence of interdependency between contracts auctioned in the same day, part
in the morning and the rest in the afternoon. The so called ”morning effect” is related to the stronger
afternoon bids realized by bidders that won contracts during the morning.
     Our adaptated model tests if winning contracts in the auction day is related to lower bids for
contracts in the same region. For that we use the variable ”Interdependency During” auction. As the
author, we control for any previous interdependency, i.e. for contracts previously won. Also following
the author, we control for the Backlog level before the auction start.

     Accordingly to Silva (2005), in his study the ”morning effect” benefits on the fact that bidders
know the contracts of the current auction, but not the contracts in the following one - to be held
in about one month later. Therefore, the bidders focus on the interdependency gains of the current
auction.
     As presented in the last column of the table 2, the interdependency and backlog coefficients
are not significant. It is worth noting that the expansion plans are presented long time before the
auction, and usually bidders knows the contracts in several following auctions, in contrast to the
setup in the De Silva study.
     We proceed estimations for the Participation Decision and For the Winning likelihood. In
both exercises, we found positive and significant correlation with Interdependency and negative and
significant correlation with CapacityConstraint5 .
    Table 3 shows the estimation results for OLS and for Switching Regression Model (SRM) proce-
dures for the Discount. It presents the estimated coefficient and Standard Error (in parentheses) for
each procedure and equation. The SRM should correct the auto-selection bias between the winner
and loser groups.
    The OLS estimates, in column (1), shows a positive coefficient for the Interdependency and
a negative for the Backlog. As expected, a higher interdependency level is correlated to a higher
Discount, i.e. with a lower bid. As part of the SRM, in column (2), we reports the estimations for
the winning probability.
     Comparing results in column (3) and (4) we can see that while Backlog is negatively correlated
the Disc in the winner group, it is not significant for the Loser group. Also, for both groups, the
coefficient for the Interdependency is positive and significantly different from zero.
     The likelihood-ratio test for the joint independence of the three equations is reported in the last
line of the output. The test suggests that the three equations are jointly independent, as required by
the model. Both ρ0 and ρ1 are positive and statistically significant, meaning that there is positive
selection into the Winner group and negative selection into the Loser group. Since ρ1 is positive,
it suggests that winners Disc are higher than a randomly selected one from the sample would be.
Since ρ0 is positive, it suggests that loser Disc are smaller than a randomly one selected one would
be.
     We repeat the SRM analysis for the Bid as the dependent variable6 . Again the estimated ρ1 and
ρ0 are significant and the model reportedly controls for selection bias, but now both parameters are
negative. As expected, the Interdependency coefficient is reported negative and significant for both,
the winner and loser groups. Furthermore, the Backlog is significant and negative for the winner
group, but not significant for the loser one. Although the signs are the opposite of the previous
model, the informations are in the same path.
    It is worth noting that, as a result of the theoretical model with perfect information, would expect
the Diff of Interdependency to be positive, suggesting that higher interdependency level would reflect
higher bids in both groups. Besides that, the variable was not reported significant in any model.
     Due to log-log estimations properties, the coefficients of log(investiment) have a elasticity in-
terpretation. it is worth noting that, for the log(bid) estimations, we observed that the elasticity
ranged between 0.9 and 1. As expected, variations in the investment prompt similar variations in
the average bid.
    To further analyze the relation between the bid and the interdependency and backlog levels, we
run a Quantile Regression Model (QRM). This method allows to infer if the variables coefficients

6    Conclusion
The theoretical model let us infer that, interdependence and capacity constraint acting together: 1-
Decrease bidders competitiveness; 2- Decrease auctioneers payoff; 3- Can lead to a raising prices pat-
tern; 4- Can be minimized by introducing additional competitors; and 5- Highlights the importance
of correct reserve price setting.
     We verified a significant negative correlation between the firm’s backlog and the auction partici-
pation, i.e. a negative correlation between the firms capacity constraint and its participation. Finally,
we also observe a positive correlation between the interdependency and both the participation and
the winning probability.
     We empirically confirmed that both interdependency and capacity constraint are highly corre-
lated to the Brazilian transmission auctions results, bid and discount. Therefore, the interdependency
between the transmission projects are related to lower investment costs and are strategically utilized
by bidders in this auction. On the opposite direction, the capacity constraint is related to higher
and less competitive bids. Consequently, the capacity constraint is associated with lower winning
probabilies and the interdependency is associated with higher winning probabilities.
     Furthermore, the use of the Switching Regression Model reduced the auto-selection bias of the
estimations and reinforced the directions of the correlations previously estimated.
     We can’t confirm the existence of ”morning effect” between the same-day auctioned contracts.
We believe that, by presenting the long term national expansion plans, the regulator diminishes the
effect in favor of interdependency effects over several other auctions.
     The implications of the above conclusions for policy makers are: 1- Capacity constraint is affect-
ing the Brazilian transmission auction, and may be one source to induce companies lack of interest;
2- Interdependency and Capacity constraint affects bidders behavior and should be introduced to the
methodology of specification of the reserve price. 3- Plans to rapid expand the grid can be frustrated
if these effects are not considered; 4- Competition can minimize backlog effects and induce companies
to bid lower.
