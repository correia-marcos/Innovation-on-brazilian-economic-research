     The main objective of this article is to examine the effects of macroprudential policy in the
     context of a theoretical model, in particular, a dynamic stochastic disequilibrium (DSDE) model.
     The DSDE model is a dynamic and stochastic general equilibrium model with intertemporal
     optimization of the agents in the economy, which is similar to dynamic stochastic general
     equilibrium (DSGE) models. The economic models are populated by households (active and
     inactive). The active households face the risk of dropping out of the labor force (i.e., risk
     permanent income loss), losing labor and profit sources of income and becoming inactive. Once
     the household is inactive, it cannot reenter the labor force and thus faces a probability of death.
     The firm sells final consumer goods to households in a perfectly competitive market and buys
     differentiated goods from a continuum of intermediate firms. These intermediate firms borrow
     from households to finance a part of its capital stock. The central bank sets monetary policy
     using a Taylor rule and macroprudential policy including a reserve requirement directly in the
     budget constraint of the active households The model assumes that nominal wage inflation is
     subject to bargaining between workers and firms, that is, labor market do not clear through
     an accommodating nominal wage. The DSDE model indicates that macroprudential policy also
     influence the system and are able to reduce credit, prices and output in the system.

     O objetivo principal deste artigo é examinar os efeitos da política macroprudencial no contexto
     de um modelo teórico, em particular, um modelo de desequilíbrio estocástico dinâmico (DSDE).
     O modelo DSDE é um modelo de equilíbrio geral dinâmico e estocástico com otimização
     intertemporal dos agentes na economia, que é semelhante aos modelos estocásticos de equilíbrio
     geral estocástico (DSGE). Os modelos econômicos são preenchidos por famílias (ativo e inativo).
     As famílias ativas enfrentam o risco de abandono da força de trabalho (ou seja, risco de perda de
     renda permanente), perdendo as fontes de renda de salário e lucro e ficando inativas. Uma vez que
     a família é inativa, não pode voltar a força de trabalho e, também, enfrenta uma probabilidade
     de morte. A empresa vende bens de consumo final às famílias em um mercado perfeitamente
     competitivo e compra bens diferenciados de um contínuo de empresas intermediárias. Essas
     empresas intermediárias emprestam empréstimos a famílias para financiar uma parte de seu
     estoque de capital. O banco central define a política monetária usando uma regra de Taylor
     e uma política macroprudencial incluindo um depósito compulsório diretamente na restrição
     orçamentária das famílias ativas. O modelo pressupõe que a inflação salarial nominal está sujeita
     a negociações entre trabalhadores e empresas, ou seja, o salário nominal não ajusta o equilíbrio de
     forma acomodatícia. O modelo DSDE indica que a política macroprudencial também influencia
     o sistema e é capaz de reduzir o crédito, os preços e a produção no sistema.

Introduction
        The general objective of this article is to analyze an economy through dynamic models with
microfoundations that exhibit intertemporal optimization and rational expectations. The construction
of a DSGE model that incorporates the general and dynamic aspects and behavioral interactions
of firms, consumers and governments allows for analysis and simulation of the economy. Thus, the
objective is to elaborate a model that facilitates the evaluation of the impacts of economic policies,
including fiscal, monetary, and macroprudential policies1 , allowing the analysis of fluctuations in the
main macroeconomic variables.
        The use of DSGE models for macroeconomic analysis is recent. Few Brazilian studies have
analyzed the mechanisms through which exogenous shocks, mainly in the financial sector, are
transmitted to the real economy, and the relation between these policies and the reduction of financial
instability is still obscure. Many DSGE models have already explored the monetary purpose of the
instruments, although, in general, they focus only on the interest rate. A plethora of questions remain
about the implementation and regulation of these macroeconomic models in the financial sector.
        The present article intends to extend the DSDE model of Schoder (2016) to include a simple
macroprudential policy hypothesis adapted from Vinhado and Divino (2016) and to simulate the
model responses by calibrating the parameters.
        The DSDE model is similar to DSGE in that its microfoundations feature intertemporal
optimization and rational expectations. The DSDE model assumes that wage rate inflation is fixed by
a collective bargaining process between firms and workers’ representatives and that the risk of income
loss faced by the household is permanent. Thus, the household accumulates precautionary savings.
The former assumption implies that the nominal wage is not an equilibrating variable as in the DSGE
model, and the latter assumption indicates a Keynesian consumption function relating consumption
to current income and wealth. Finally, we add a monetary authority adopting an RR to control the
supply of funds directly to the household as a macroprudential policy problem. The remainder of this
article is organized as follows. Section 3.1 provides some references for the DSGE model. Section 3.2
describes the DSDE model. Section 3.4 presents the results: first explaining the implications of the
DSDE model, second indicating the model parametrization, and finally, displaying the simulation
exercises for the DSDE model. A conclusion is provided in the final section of this article.


1 Theoretical references
        Many DSGE models in New Keynesian economics seek to introduce rigidity and shocks so that
economic theory approaches reality and, consequently, fits the observed data. Christiano, Eichenbaum
and Evans (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2003) are references for DSGE models following the
adjustment principle, which pursue adherence to the observed data (COSTA-JUNIOR, 2015). Models
developed at IPEA (VEREDA; CAVALCANTI, 2010; CAVALCANTI; VEREDA, 2011) and the BCB
(CASTRO et al., 2011), called SAMBA, consider large and medium-sized firms and are reference
models compatible with the Brazilian economic context.
        Some articles initially explored the assumptions that characterize the financial sector and
are included in DSGE models. For example, the financial accelerator hypothesis (BERNANKE;
GERTLER; GILCHRIST, 1999) and more complex forms, such as the banking sector (BRZOZA-
BRZEZINA; MAKARSKI, 2011) and banking conglomerates (GERALI et al., 2010), consider the
inclusion of financial friction on the demand and supply sides of credit.
        Regarding financial sector models, Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999) present one of the
first DSGE models to include financial friction. The authors also include the financial accelerator

    The macroprudential policy debate incorporates instruments that are used periodically in the pursuit of the financial
    stability of the overall economic system (GALATI; MOESSNER, 2011).

mechanism so that the focus of financial friction is on the demand side of credit and the financial
system amplifies the economic cycle. Brzoza-Brzezina and Makarski (2011) develop a model with
more financial sector elements, including friction in the demand for credit requiring collateral from the
borrower and a banking sector that charges different funding and lending rates than the established
policy rate.
        A second aspect of the literature explores another element of economic policy and regulation:
stabilizing the financial system as a whole through macroprudential policy. That is, some papers study
the role of macroprudential policies and try to incorporate them into modeling. Some economists
(WOODFORD, 2011; SVENSSON, 2012) discuss the need to analyze the impacts of macroeconomic
policies through modeling that includes a macroeconomic framework that is separate from monetary
policy, with its own instruments and objectives (policy goals) to reduce the systemic risk of the
overall economy. Some of the instruments that can be incorporated are compulsory deposits, CRs,
government-imposed taxes, and capital controls in the case of open economies.
        On the other hand, many recent articles highlight the role of macroprudential policy, its
instruments and its objectives, including Galati and Moessner (2011), Vinals et al. (2011), Collin et
al. (2014), ENGLAND (2009), Borio (2011), Shin (2010), CGFS (2010), among others. These authors
agree that the general objective of macroprudential policy is financial stability. Galati and Moessner
(2011) provide one definition of financial stability: a financial system that is robust to external shocks.
This means a financial system that is resilient to normal-sized shocks such that it can reciver and
perform its standard functions (SILVA; SALES; GAGLIANONE, 2013; BORIO; DREHMANN, 2009;
VINALS et al., 2011).
        To evaluate the conduct of macroeconomic policy, several papers analyze the role of macropru-
dential instruments in the economy and in the financial system as a whole. Some show that many
countries use these as auxiliary instruments of monetary policy and/or as tools of financial stability.
Brzoza-Brzezina, Kolasa and Makarski (2013) introduce CRs in order to examine their impact on the
economic system using a DSGE model for the euro zone; moreover, Ferreira (2016), Brandi (2013)
do so for the Brazilian system, Glocker and Towbin (2012), Agénor, Silva and Awazu (2011) assess
the impact of the RR using a DSGE model in the Brazilian context, and Vinhado and Divino (2016)
include the two instruments cited above in their model.


2 Model
        The DSDE model proposed by Schoder (2016) is the reference for our analysis. The DSDE is
a DSGE model with modifications to the labor market and household problems. In the latter case,
the household faces an uninsurable risk of permanent income loss that creates precautionary saving
motives, which in turn, lead to a consumption function that is related to current income and wealth.
In the former case, the nominal wage is not an equilibrium variable that clears the labor market. The
financial system is included in the model based on the adaptations of Vinhado and Divino (2016).
The central bank sets monetary policy and macroprudential rules in order to ensure financial stability.
        The economic model is populated by households (economically active and inactive). The final
good firm sells consumer goods to households in a perfectly competitive market and buys differentiated
goods from a continuum of intermediate firms. These intermediate firms borrow a part of the capital
stock from the households. The central bank sets monetary and macroprudential policy, aiming first
for a Taylor rule with inflation stabilization. For macroprudential policy, the central bank regulates
the economically active households’ wealth directly by setting an RR in the budget constraint. The
model also considers the government budget to be balanced at all times. The model assumes that
the labor market does not clear through an accommodating nominal wage; in particular, nominal
wage inflation is subject to a bargaining process between workers and firms. In the simplest case, the
rate of wage inflation is constant. The economy grows at deterministic rate given by labor-embodied

2.1 Households
        There are two types of households: active and inactive. The first are born into generations of
constant size (size 1) and are part of the labor force. They face a per-period risk U of permanent
income loss, that is, of the risk of dropping out of the labor force, losing labor and profit sources of
income and becoming economically inactive. Once a household is inactive, it cannot return to the
labor force. An inactive household faces a per-period probability of death D. 2
        The representative inactive household i does not work or obtain income and faces a per-period
probability of death (independent of age). The source of income is the wealth he accumulated during
the active state. The stock of wealth is equal across households entering the inactive stage at the same
time (t − s), but it is different between households that become inactive at different times. Here, bi,t−s,t
is the end-of-period t real wealth held by an inactive household when it becomes inactive in t − s with
s ∈ {0, 1, ..., ∞}. The household sells wealth at beginning of period t (Rt Pt bi,t−s,t , where Rt and Pt
are the nominal interest rate and the price level, respectively) to an insurance market in a framework
similar to that proposed by Blanchard (1985) and considering that he may die between t and t + 1
(that is, at beginning of period t + 1). Thus, the inactive household receives a flow value of bequests
from the insurance company (of households still alive Rt−1 Pt−1 bi,t−s,t−1 and of dead households whose
wealth is distributed by the insurance company to households that are still alive DRt−1 Pt−1 bi,t−s,t−1
). The problem of inactive households is to choose the optimal paths for consumption (ci,t−s,t ) and
wealth (bi,t−s,t ) subject the budget constraint3 and conditional on staying alive in a dynamic program
of the following form:


                        Vi (bi,t−s,t−1 ) = max {lnci,t−s,t−1 + β(1 − D)Et Vi (bi,t−s,t )}

                                                                    Rt−1 (1 + D)
                                         s.t. ci,t−s,t + bi,t−s,t =              bi,t−s,t−1
                                                                        Πp,t

where β is the discount factor, Πp,t is the gross rate of price inflation, Vi (bi,t−s,t−1 ) is the value function
in t, bi,t−s,t−1 is the state variable, and Et is the expectations operator. The model derivation is
provided in Annex A1. The model aggregation is available in Schoder (2016).
         The following equations display the problem of the active households as a dynamic program.
The problem is to choose optimal paths for consumption (ca , t) and wealth (ba,t ) subject the budget
constraint. Active households consume and face a risk U of dropping out of the labor force (i.e., the
risk of a permanent income loss), and to insure against this risk, the active households will accumulate
precautionary savings.4 They have the same wealth regardless of when they were born, and they
cannot die and lose their income in the same period. The labor supply will be fixed at n, and every
active household is affected by unemployment:

                   s.t. ca,t + ba,t = ω(1 − ut )n + πd,t − tt − τt +       ba,t−1 − µt ba,t
                                                                      Πp,t

    The law of motion of the active population size Θa,t is Θa,t − Θa,t−1 = 1 − U Θa,t−1 , and the inactive population
    size Θi,t is Θi,t − Θa,t−1 = U Θa,t−1 − DΘit−1 . The steady state values are Θa = 1/U and Θi = 1/D.

    The adoption of the savings buffer setup is from Carroll (1997), Rabitsch and Schoder (2016) in which the household
    faces the risk of a permanent income loss and will optimally accumulate precautionary savings. One of the main
    findings is that the level of steady-state consumption in the buffer stock savings model is lower than in conventional
    models.

where ωt , ut , πd,t and tt are the real wage, the unemployment rate, distributed profits, and a lump-sum
government tax, respectively; Va (ba,t−1 ) is the value function in t; ba,t−1 is the state variable; Vi (ba,t )
is the value function of active households that become inactive at the beginning of t+1; and τt
is a simplification for aggregation. It is assumed that wealth is equally distributed across active
non-newborn and newborn households at any point in time. Therefore, a newborn receives ba,t − τt ;
in other words, the non-newborn transfer is τt of the household wealth. 5 Macroprudential policy is
represented as µba,t . The central bank charges µ of the household’s wealth as a direct RR in order to
control the supply of funds.
        Calculating the first-order conditions (FOC) of the household problem and their aggregation
yields the following main equations. The FOCs of an inactive household are as in equation 1, which
proportionately relates their consumption in period t to their beginning-of-period wealth by a factor
κ, where κ = (1 − β(1 − D)). Since an active household internalizes the inactive household’s solution,
this gives rise to a crucial property of the household problem: a Keynesian-type consumption function
at the steady state. This is because the consumption choice of an inactive household is proportional
to its previously accumulated real wealth:

U B̃a,t−1 is the wealth that became inactive at the beginning of t. Equation 2 is the aggregate budget
constraint of the inactive household, and 3 is the aggregate budget constraint of the active household,
which are normalized by the trend Γt . Only active households receive wage and profit income, whereas
newly inactive households receive funds from wealth carried over as a previously active household:

        Finally, the FOC w.r.t. consumption yields the aggregate consumption Euler equation for the
active households in which the discounted expected marginal utility of consumption in the next period
includes the risk of permanent income loss and depends on real wealth. This equation is implied by
the substitution of the inactive household FOCs for the active household FOCs, observing that the
        Rt

    Schoder (2016) assumes that the transfer is financed by a tax on wealth (τt = τ ba,t ), and hence, τ = U . This is
    because (1/U − 1)τ ba,t = ba,t − τ ba,t ; that is, the payment aggregated over all non-newborn active households must
    equal the receipts aggregated over all newborn active households.

2.2 Firms
       The representative final good firm buys a wide variety of intermediate inputs and sell them as
a unique basket of consumption goods to households in a perfectly competitive market. The final
good firm uses good yt as an input and takes the price pt as given for a continuum of differentiated
intermediate firms. The minimization cost problem of the final good firms leads to a demand for
intermediate good given the final good technology, the price of the intermediate good and the demand
for the final good. In others words, the minimization cost problem is subject to final good firm’s
production function and leads to an inverse relationship between the input price and the demand for
a given output of final goods:
                                                                    Z 1

        The intermediate good demand depends on the price of the intermediate good relative to the
price of the final good.
        There is an infinite continuum of intermediate good firms. The representative firm sells
differentiated goods to the final firm with some market power under monopolistic competition; it is
thus a price maker. The intermediate good yt is produced using a constant-returns-to-scale Cobb-
Douglas technology combining labor lt and capital kt−1 as inputs and facing quadratic adjustment
costs in investment and prices. The production function is the following:

                                              yt = (Γkt−1 )α (Γt lt )1−α

where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 is the output elasticity of capital, and Γt lt is the the labor-embodied productivity
that grows at a deterministic rate. At the end of period t, the intermediate firm produces yt using
labor lt and capital kt−1 as inputs (given capital adjustment costs) and choosing the capital good kt to
be used in production in the subsequent period. The model includes a firm-specific capital assumption
in which firms own their capital stock, and their initial capital stock cannot be reduced. For instance,
7
    Price elasticity of substitution of inputs is the relative change of the ratio of the intermediate goods yi,t over
    the relative change of the ratio of the according price yi,t . The minimization cost problem is subject to the
    Dixit-Stiglitz(1977) aggregator, which aggregates technology including monopolistic competition and increasing
    returns in the short run. The elasticity is invariant to quantity of intermediate firms (infinite number), so the
    elasticity and markup are constant.


                                                                6
the firm’s capital cannot be rented or sold in the market because it is specific to a given firm. This is
the case, for example, among real estate companies and firms that use specialized equipment. The
following capital accumulation equation states that the capital stock available at the end of period t is
equal to the capital stock available in the last period, kt−1 , net of period t capital stock depreciation,
δKt−1 , with δ being the depreciation rate, plus the amount of capital accumulated during period t,
which is determined by investments made during that period it :

                                                       kt = it + (1 − δ)kt−1

       In addition, the intermediate firm’s problem includes how much of its investment will be
financed externally, that is, the supply of bonds dt . Firms obtain resources from households, issuing
bonds equal to the number of units of capital kt , where the price of one unit of capital is equal to qt .
This constraint depends on a fixed portion of capital goods measured as an efficient price:

                                                                dt = λqt kt

where λ is the target debt-capital ratio, and qt is Tobin’s q.
        Furthermore, the intermediate firm faces adjustment costs in prices and capital. We assume
quadratic costs for both costs. This means that the adjustments costs increase disproportionally faster
than the amount of capital (or good prices) to be adjusted. Additionally, the function assumes a zero
value when there is no shock to increase the cost and when the investment covers depreciation (in the
case of price adjustments, when prices do not change). In other words, in setting the nominal prices
of their goods and installing new capital in their factories, firms face costly adjustments. The capital
and price adjustment costs are assumed to evolve according to the respective equations:

                                                                !2                                       !2

where τi and τp are the adjustment cost scaling parameters, namely, the degree of capital and price
rigidity, respectively.

        All intermediate firms set their prices using the same markup over the same marginal costs.
The elasticity of substitution of inputs is derived from the final firm demand for intermediate goods
and determines the markup that the intermediate firms charge over their marginal cost (given the
price adjustment cost). Consequently, the intermediate firm has a certain degree of market power in
monopolistic competition and can set the prices of goods. Nevertheless, price setting incorporates
nominal adjustment costs, as noted by Rotemberg (1982). In other words, the model includes nominal
price rigidity in which prices are adjusted more slowly than ideal. This adjustment cost leads to good
prices that are lower than they would be without nominal rigidity, and as a result, the markup over
marginal costs is also smaller. The first term in equation 9 refers to the logic of the markup over the
marginal cost; the last two terms are related to the price adjustment cost.
        The FOCs w.r.t. it and kt show that the intermediate firm decision is related to investment in
terms of the capital stock by the shadow price of investment qt , namely, by Tobin’s theory of investment.
It expresses the capital price measured as capital profitability and comes from the constraint – the law
of motion of capital – from the firm’s optimization problem (Lagrangian multiplier). For instance, the
firm will optimally choose it given by qt . In others words, the optimal investment choice in t depends
on the value of qt . Tobin’s q in this model implies the marginal value of an additional unit of capital
in terms of profits, taking into account capital adjustment costs, that is, when increasing investment
today by a one unit, equation 10 (the marginal loss of an increase in it ) must be equal to equation
11 (the marginal gain due to an extra unit of capital in the subsequent period). In other words, qt
"measure[s] how much profits the firm would gain by having one more unit of capital installed in the
next period" Schoder (2016).

        Equations 11 and 12 refer to the logic of qt . Equation 12 reveals that the long-run desired level
of capital is dependent on the long-run level of output (expected sales) Ỹt+1 , real wages (represented
as real marginal costs ϕt+1 ) and real interest rates (represented in Et Λt,t+1 ). The short-run dynamics
of the desired capital stock are implied by the equations given changes in those variables. For instance,
an increase in the real wage given a certain level of output (sales) and a real interest rate, leads to
an increase in the desired capital stock (substitution effect). Alternatively, an increase in the real
interest rate reduces the desired capital stock given the real wage and the level of output. Note that
the short-run dynamics of the desired capital stock, that is, the response of investment to shocks and
how long a response takes, also depend on the adjustment costs.

2.4 Monetary and fiscal policy

where G̃ is steady-state government spending, and VG,t is an exogenous fiscal policy shock. The
monetary authority defines monetary and macroprudential rules to ensure monetary and financial
stability, respectively. The monetary authority sets the interest rate according to a simple Taylor rule
that considers only inflation stabilization:

(sensitivity) of the interest rate to deviations in inflation from the steady-state rate, and VR,t is a
monetary policy shock.

2.5 Market clearing and model closure
        The DSGE model assumes an accommodating nominal wage that ensures that the labor supply
equals the labor demand. The DSDE has a Keynesian closure in the sense that the rate of wage
inflation is subject to a bargaining process between worker and firm representatives, with a Nash
solution to the optimization problem. In other words, nominal wage inflation is a non-accommodating
variable in the labor market:

where Vt is an exogenous shock to bargaining power, ω̃(Πω,t ) is the steady-state real wage, and r(Πω,t )
is steady-state profit rate. These last two variables represent the return functions of workers and firms,
respectively, where the former increases with the rate of wage inflation and the later decreases. Thus,

this is a game between the return functions of two agents concerned with the long-run implications of
the bargaining process. The FOC shows the evolution of the desired rate of wage inflation (Πω,t ):


                                                        ω̃(Πω,t ) r0 (Πω,t )
                                     1 = (1 − 1/νt )                                                       (20)

        The parameter φu can assume values of 0 or 2; that is, it is equal to 2 when there is feedback
from the labor market to wage formation and 0 when there is no feedback effect. Thus, the rate
of wage inflation is constant. The relation between the growth rate of real wage and wage or price
inflation is given by:
                                             ω̃t

      The macroeconomic balance condition that aggregate demand equals output ensures that the
good market clears:
                                                                          !2

       Therefore, this model hypothesizes that the labor market is not cleared by the nominal wage,
and the consequence is output determination by aggregate demand.

policy, fiscal policy, worker bargaining power and macroprudential policy. They evolve according to:

where εR,t , εG,t , εµ,t and εν,t are assumed to be exogenous, i.i.d. and normal innovations (∼ N (0, 1)).


3 Model results
        The representation of the economy as a general equilibrium model with linearized equations
derived from the dynamic optimization problem of the agents in the economy is subject to some
restrictions, is not a trivial methodology and is dependent on a numerical solution and a state-space
representation. Therefore, the adoption of these models generates requires the researcher to use
complex mathematical methods to solve the optimization problems of the agents, including new
hypotheses and linear approximations of these conditions around a chosen point, the steady state.
Non-trivial effort is exerted to obtain the numerical solution to the model and its simulation in
order to investigate the dynamics of the relations of interest. This process essentially depends on the
calibration of the parameters and the assignment of values compatible with economic reality. The
following section describes the parameter calibration and out-of-steady-state dynamics in order to
analyze the economy characterized by the DSDE model, as well as the model implications of the
DSDE hypothesis.

3.1 Implications of the hypothesis and steady state of the DSDE model
        The intertemporal consumption problem includes the risk to active households of dropping
out of the labor force. Moreover, active households consider the solution to the inactive household
problem (consumption proportional to real wealth). In the Euler equation, the active household’s
expected utility of consumption depends on its previously accumulated wealth. The standard Euler
equation includes consumption dependent on individual preferences; in contrast, the DSDE model
includes current wealth as related to current consumption. Therefore, the DSDE Euler equation can
be called a Keynesian-type consumption function (CARROLL, 1997; RABITSCH; SCHODER, 2016;
SCHODER, 2016).8 This can be seen since there is a equilibrium relationship among income, wealth
and consumption. The equilibrium consumption and wealth conditional on income can be calculated :

                                Then we have two equations (Euler equation and budget constrain of active household)
                                in the consumption-income ratio and the wealth-income ratio for which the existence of
                                a unique solution can be shown under certain parameter constellations. As we can see,
                                introducing the risk of permanent income loss to the conventional consumer problem
                                implies the existence of an equilibrium consumption-income ratio and wealth-income
                                ratio. With rising income, consumption will increase by a fixed proportion which is
                                very similar to a Keynesian consumption function. (SCHODER, 2016, p.6)

        Another implication of the DSDE Euler equation is related to the interest rate. In the standard
DSGE model with zero unemployment, the natural interest rate is implied by a parameter restriction
on the Euler equation. The central bank’s target interest rate also needs to equal the natural interest
rate derived from the Euler equation for the steady state to be obtained. The DSDE model has a
different logic. The steady-state interest rate (derived from the Euler equation) needs to equal the
target rate; however, the former rate is not implied solely by parameter restrictions. There is a new
element of the Euler equation in which consumption is related to wealth and the real interest rate,
that is, the steady-state interest rate is implied by the steady states of other variables. In other
words, the real interest rate is implied by almost the entire system. Is this the natural interest rate?
Not always. In the steady state, the unemployment rate can be different than zero, and with the
assumption of a constant nominal wage (without labor feedback), the labor market will not be cleared
by the nominal wage, leading to a steady-state interest rate that is different from a steady state in
which there is no unemployment. The steady-state interest rate is calculated by using a given wage
inflation rate that may or may not equal the natural rate (labor market clearing).
        The steady state of the model is calibrated with unemployment of 10%. This means that the
steady-state interest rate is not equal to the natural rate in this calibration. It is important to note
an additional implication of the interest rate mechanism. The real interest rate has to be lower than
the deterministic growth rate for the existence of a meaningful steady state in the DSDE model.
This restriction stems from the precautionary savings motive that needs a stock of wealth that grows
slower than income; otherwise, wealth would increase exponentially. Schoder (2017) alludes to the
fact that the DSDE model is dynamic inefficient (a criterion of Pareto efficiency), since the resources
are underutilized in equilibrium.
        Moreover, the nominal wage is not an accommodating variable that adjusts to clear the labor
market, i.e., there is unemployment that is not merely frictional, and nominal wage movements do
not eliminate unemployment entirely. As a consequence, business fluctuations (output changes) are
not given by changes in the factor markets. This means that the equilibrium adjustment of aggregate
output occurs through aggregate spending, which is demand-driven adjustment. Although there is
an effect of supply shocks on demand and output through labor market feedback (a supply shock

    "In comparison with the standard model, the buffer-stock model predicts a much higher marginal propensity to
    consume out of transitory income, a much higher effective discount rate for future labor income, and a positive
    rather than negative sign for the correlation between saving and expected labor income growth" Rabitsch and
    Schoder (2016, p.2).

changes relative bargaining power, nominal wage inflation and, consequently, demand), the output is
determined by aggregate demand. This is a feature of disequilibrium models.

3.2 Parameter calibration
         The main parameters of the model are calibrated as in Schoder (2016). In the relevant part of
the parameterization, it is appropriate to conduct a literature review of the Brazilian and international
literature on the assigned values. The values can be based on the relevant literature and/or estimated
via Bayesian techniques and the information contained in the data. This procedure is intended to test
the ability of the model to fit the data and to represent stylized facts. The objective of this chapter is
to first conduct a simulation exercise using the values assigned by Schoder and adding the parameter
values related to macroprudential policy, particularly the RR, as in Vinhado and Divino (2016).
         Table 1 lists the parameters and the values they were assigned for the model simulation. The
probability of income loss of an active household (U) is such that the old age dependency ratio9 is 0.3,
that is, U/D = 0.3, κ is implied by (1 − β(1 − D)), and N is the aggregate labor supply calibrated
such that 10% of labor force is unemployed in the steady state. Here, φυ,u takes the value 0 for no
labor market feedback and 2 for labor market feedback.
         Regarding central bank macroprudential policy, φµ assumes the value 0.255, as stipulated in
Vinhado and Divino (2016). The central bank response to credit volume fluctuations is assumed to be
tepid (1/4 of the increase/decrease in credit volume) because the RR is only somewhat frequently
used. This parameter is the only value calibrated as in Vinhado and Divino (2016), and we have
defined a steady-state RR of 20% (0.2). The remaining parameters are defined as in Schoder (2016).

3.3 Impulse-response analysis
       This section presents a model simulation exercise for macroeconomic variables in the DSDE
model given as exogenous shocks. The predicted macroeconomic effect is revealed by an impulse-
response analysis over an interval of forty quarters. The model dynamics are reported given an
exogenous shock to budget-neutral fiscal policy, monetary policy, macroprudential policy and worker
bargaining power. The main idea is to understand not only the effect of macroprudential policy but
also the overall transmission mechanism of the model. The following figures display the responses to
exogenous policy economic shocks that cause deviations from the steady state.

3.3.1 Fiscal policy shock
        Figure 1 plots the impulse-response functions for a 1% budget-neutral government spending
shock. The baseline model assumes constant wage inflation (unemployment elasticity of the workers’
bargaining power φν,u = 0) and lump-sum taxes of the same amount as government expending (the
purpose is to maintain a balanced budget). The model dynamics work similarly to those in a textbook
Keynesian model, with multiplier effects in output, consumption and investment for twenty quarters
and without crowding-out effects for the last two variables. Output increases by approximately 1.00
units, and consumption increase by approximately 0.08 units in the sixth quarter and investment
increase by about 0.09 units in the fourth quarter. Consumption and net income initially decrease
after an interest rate hike.
        Despite higher taxes and RRs at the beginning of the period, disposable income increases make
it possible for households to spend more on consumption goods. The credit volume increases, and
higher prices reduce the real wage at a given nominal wage, which in turn, decreases the unemployment
rate and stimulates investment. The interest rate increases, reducing prices and elevating real wages.
The propagation mechanism is the adjustment not only of prices but also of quantities.

3.3.2 Monetary policy shock
        The transmission mechanism for a 1% interest rate shock in the economic model is displayed
in Figure 2. Output, consumption and investment decrease, and the interest rate increases moderately
as prices return to their steady-state values. Disposable income and credit volume decrease, as does
the RR volume. The real wage increases given the initial fall in prices, but since firms consider real
marginal costs when setting the prices of intermediate goods, the prices eventually increase and the
real wage decreases, with some persistence after twenty periods. The prices and capital adjustment
costs also contribute persistence to the aggregate demand variables and their components as they
return to their steady-state levels. An increase in real wages is sufficient only for returning investment
to the steady-state level. The substitution effect does not work in the initial period because, given
predetermined capital, a higher real wage is correlated with a decrease in the output-capital ratio
(Yt/Kt-1 - equation 13), which in turn, reduces the initial output. A decrease in investment is
associated with a rising real interest rate that reduces the desired capital stock.

3.3.3 Macroprudential policy shock
        The effects of an exogenous contractionary RR shock in the DSDE model are depicted in
Figure 3. The macroprudential policy shock has the opposite effects on macroeconomics variables as a
government expenditure shock. A higher RR acts similarly to a lump-sum tax in the model, decreasing
disposable income and, given multiplier effects, reducing output, investment and consumption. The
credit volume also decreases. With an initial decrease in prices, the consequence is an increase in real
wages and increase in unemployment rate. Returning to equilibrium after a macroprudential policy
shock takes about as long as recovery following a fiscal policy shock.
        Vinhado and Divino (2016) note that macroprudential policy could be either a substitute for
or a complement to monetary policy given its effects on lower inflation in their model. The decrease in
prices following a contractionary RR rate shock is reproduced in the DSDE model, which is consistent
with the related literature on the effects of the economic cycle.

3.3.4 Worker bargaining power shock
        Figure 4 shows the impulse-response functions for a 1% persistent shock to worker bargaining
power in the model. The increase in price inflation induces an increase in real wages and a subsequent
decrease in aggregate demand and its components. Given a labor supply and a capital stock, increases
in real wages and in the real interest rate are sufficient to increase real marginal costs and to reduce
the expected profits of firms (evaluated as Tobin’s q), causing increases in unemployment and price
inflation and decreases in income, credit volume and RR volume.

Conclusion
         The overall proposal is to verify the model’s response, through key macroeconomic variables,
to changes in economic policies and to external shocks. This article seeks to contribute to theoretical
modeling for the evaluation of macroeconomic scenarios, particularly for models of dynamic intertem-
poral optimization, which are widely used by policy makers to understand the Brazilian framework
and to forecast economic variables. Specifically, this analysis contributes to the important function of
evaluating economic policy strategies and their effects on long-term growth.
         The article proposes the inclusion of a macroprudential instrument, an RR that acts directly on
household wealth, in a Keynesian framework in which households face the probability of income loss,
save in a precautionary way, are subject to unemployment and wage inflation is fixed by Nash solution
to a bargaining process between worker and firm representatives. The continuum of intermediate
good firms faces quadratic adjustment costs in capital and prices and is subject to some restrictions
in its operating environment.
         This is the first simulation of the DSDE model with macroprudential policy, and although it
is still being calibrated, the model has already demonstrated some expected results. RRs reduce price
inflation, credit volume and the interest rate. Also, the RR causes a small recession in the economy,
with reductions of output, consumption and investment, but the reduction in aggregate demand is
smaller than that from a monetary policy shock. However, one problem was identified: the increase
in variable volatility after a given shock. Fiscal and monetary policy shocks showed some outcomes
predicted by Keynesian models without the crowding out private investment given an increase in
government spending and a negative impact on aggregate demand given an interest rate shock. This
is a peculiarity of disequilibrium models with fixed prices even in the steady state. The bargaining
problem between workers and firms over the rate of wage inflation is a important assumption of the
DSDE model and is another Keynesian feature.
         Based on the model elaborated above, future developments of the model should estimate the
parameters from the Brazilian data using Bayesian techniques in order to determine for the actual
values of the structural parameters of the model in the Brazilian context and to fine-tune the model
using data. Another possibility is the inclusion of financial intermediation by banks or the financial
sector. It is expected that the incorporation of the financial sector into our model would highlight
transmission channels from this sector to the real economy, as well as the economic policy shocks,
particularly macroprudential policies, that can help smooth the business cycle.
