         Resumo
         O artigo apresenta um modelo macroeconômico formal na tentativa de explicar o impacto
         líquido das variações na taxa de juros sobre a inflação no longo prazo. No modelo proposto, o
         grau de endividamento das empresas é explicitamente introduzido na análise da acumulação
         de capital, do prêmio de risco dos bancos e da inflação. Em um ambiente marcado pela
         incerteza fundamental, as diferenças sobre como credores e devedores avaliam os riscos
         futuros tendem a emergir, e, portanto, nada garante que a quantidade de crédito concedido
         para as empresas que equilibra o mercado de crédito também permita uma trajetória
         sustentável da acumulação de capital no longo prazo. Demonstra-se que a estabilidade
         financeira da dinâmica da acumulação de capital está intimamente associada à estabilidade a
         longo prazo do processo inflacionário. Neste modelo, o impacto a longo prazo do aumento
         das taxas de juros sobre a inflação depende da capacidade de resposta dos preços a mudanças
         nos salários reais e pagamentos de juros. Em outras palavras, os preços no longo prazo podem
         subir ou cair em razão de uma mudança na taxa de juros, dependendo de qual efeito
         prevalece. Esses resultados lançam luz sobre a eficácia dos regimes de metas de inflação
         como forma de controlar os preços no longo prazo.

         Abstract
         This paper sets out a formal macroeconomic model to account for the net impact of changes
         in the interest rate on long-term inflation. In this model the degree of firms’ indebtedness is
         explicitly introduced in the analysis of capital accumulation, commercial banks’ risk
         premium, and inflation. In an environment of fundamental uncertainty, differences on how
         lenders and borrowers assess future risks tend to emerge, and hence nothing guarantees that
         the market-clearing amount of credit granted to firms also guarantees a sustainable path of
         capital accumulation in the long run. It is shown that the financial stability of the capital
         accumulation dynamics is closely linked to the long-run stability of the inflationary process.
         In this model, the long-term impact of raising interest rates on inflation depends on the
         responsiveness of prices to changes in the real wages and interest payments. In other words,
         prices in the long run can go up or down after an interest rate shock depending on which
         effect prevails. These findings shed some light on the effectiveness of inflation-targeting
         regimes to steers prices in the long run.

1    Introduction

From the standpoint of mainstream economists, inflation is mainly caused by excess demand. According
to the New Consensus Macroeconomics1 paradigm if the market interest rate is lower than the natural
interest rate, then the excess of money supply will lead to an unemployment rate that is also lower than
the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). The NAIRU is a long-run equilibrium rate
of unemployment which depends exclusively on structural factors such as the labour market regulations
and social programs, for instance. In this spirit, the Central Bank sets a target inflation rate and uses short-
term interest rates, its main monetary policy instrument, in order to fine-tune the economy and steer
prices.
   Post-Keynesian economists, on the other hand, reject the idea that inflation is caused by excess money
supply, once the money supply is considered to be endogenous. They also do not believe in the existence
of a NAIRU, since the unemployment rate in the short and in the long run depends of firm’s expectations
about the effective demand. In Post-Keynesian theory inflation is caused mainly by distribution conflict
between workers and capitalists instead of excess money supply. In spite of these issues, some authors
have shown that inflation targeting is not completely incompatible with the Post-Keynesian theory
(Davidson, 2006; Sawyer, 2006; Lima and Setterfield, 2008) and hence analyse the impact of interest rate
shocks on prices.
   However, the Post-Keynesian inflation-targeting policies, like the New Consensus policies, are
basically concerned about the short-run time frame. Very few works examine the consequences of interest
rate shocks on the inflation rate in the long run. Hein (2008) and Hein and Stockhammer (2011)
developed a Kaleckian model where inflation-targeting monetary policies can control accelerating
inflation in the short run by decreasing the employment rate until it matches the ‘stable inflation rate of
employment’ (SIRE). In the long run, however, the SIRE becomes endogenous to the interest rate and
hence a contractionary monetary policy, in these models, affects differently the actual unemployment rate
and the SIRE. Thus, if a raising interest rate reduces more the SIRE than the actual employment rate, then
the bargaining power of workers increases, wages accelerate and prices speed up. It can only happen
because these models assume that wages are positively related to the gap between the actual rate of
capacity utilization and the equilibrium capacity utilization that corresponds to SIRE. Therefore, in these
models, long-run price instability is essentially caused by a mismatch between the actual and the
equilibrium rates of capacity utilization. Nonetheless, by assuming that the amount of credit granted to
firms relative to the capital stock remains constant, these models neglect the fact that changes in the price
of loans (the interest rate) affect the quantity of loans.
   By relaxing the assumption of a constant debt-capital ratio, this work aims to show how raising interest
rates change the debt structure of firms and hence affect the long-run inflation rate. In a scenario of
fundamental uncertainty, borrowers and lenders tend to form different expectations about the future.
Firms and commercial banks are unable to know objectively the maximum amount of loans that firms can
take without becoming insolvent, and hence lenders are likely to limit the supply of additional credit. But
even if borrowers and lenders agree on the market-clearing amount of loans, nothing guarantees that the
equilibrium amount of credit granted to firms also ensures their solvency over time. In times of
exceedingly high optimism lenders may be willing to supply credit until the point where firms are unable
to repay their debts. Since firms set a mark-up over their prime costs, raising wages and interest payments
are identified in this work as the main causes of long-term inflation. As discussed below, a contractionary
monetary policy is more likely to reduce wages and increase the interest payments from firms to rentiers.
Therefore, only if the negative impact of raising interest rates on wages overcompensates the increase in
the interest payments, then the long-term inflation will be reduced. We also show that in the case of a

 The New Consensus Macroeconomics models are characterised by three key components: (i) an aggregate demand curve; (ii)
a short-run Phillips curve that relates the inflation rate to the output gap; (iii) a Central Bank reaction function, that is, the
Taylor Rule. For more details see Clarida et al (1999), Taylor (2000) and Meyer (2001).
                                                                2
financially unstable system, a mix of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies might help to bring the
economy back to a stable, solvent path.

2    The model

We assume a one-sector, closed economy. We also assume a fixed-coefficient production function where
labour (𝐿) and capital (𝐾) are used as factors of production. Since we suppose a constant capital-potential
output ratio, the capacity utilization (𝑢) is given by the output-capital ratio. Given the existence of excess
capacity, the rate of capacity utilization must adjust to accommodate excess demand or supply.

2.1 Classes

There are two classes in the economy, workers and capitalists. Workers earn only wages (𝑊) and
consume all their income. Capitalists are divided into entrepreneurs and rentiers. Entrepreneurs earn
profits of enterprises and save a constant fraction of their income. Rentiers earn income from the stock of
credit granted to firms at a given market interest rate (𝑖) and also save a constant fraction of their income.
Total income is given by

    𝑌 = (𝑊 ⁄𝑃)𝐿 + Π                                                                            (1)
    𝑢 = 𝜎𝑢 + 𝑟                                                                                 (2)
    𝜎 = (𝑊 ⁄𝑃𝑎)                                                                                (3)
    𝑟 = Π⁄𝐾 = (1 − 𝜎)𝑢                                                                         (4)

where 𝑃 is the price level, 𝜎 is the wage share of income, Π is total profit, 𝑟 is the profit rate and 𝑎 = 𝑌⁄𝐿
is the labour productivity. Following Hein (2008), we split total profits (Π) into profits of firms (Π𝑐 ) and
income of rentiers (Π𝑓 )

    Π = Π𝑐 + Π𝑓 = Π𝑐 + 𝑖𝐵                                                                      (5)

where 𝐵 is the stock of credit granted to firms.
  The debt-capital ratio is

    𝜆 = 𝐵⁄𝐾                                                                                    (6)

2.2 Interest rate and the endogenous risk premium

The nominal interest rate (𝑖𝑛 ) is given by the sum of the ex-ante real interest rate (𝑖𝑟𝑒 ) and the expected
inflation (𝑝𝑒 )

    𝑖𝑛 = 𝑖𝑟𝑒 + 𝑝𝑒                                                                              (7)

Following Lima and Setterfield (2008), we assume that the Central Bank is credibly committed to achieve
the inflation target, 𝑝𝑇 . This creates a conventional anchor for the expectations of decision makers, so that

    𝑝𝑒 = 𝑝𝑇                                                                                    (9)

Since there is no unexpected inflation, ex-ante and ex-post nominal interest rate are equal, and hence

    𝑖𝑛 = 𝑖𝑟 + 𝑝 𝑇                                                                             (10)



                                                       3
Commercial banks calculate the nominal market interest rate (𝑖) by marking up the benchmark nominal
interest rate set by the Central Bank (𝑖𝐶𝐵 )

     𝑖 = 𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙                                                                                        (11)

where 𝜙 is the risk and liquidity premium. This mark-up is a risk and liquidity premium set by
commercial banks and depends on the degree of competition in the banking sector, the debt-capital ratio,
and the capacity utilization, as follows

    𝜙 = 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆 − 𝜙2 𝑢                                                                                (12)

where 𝜙0 , 𝜙1 , 𝜙2 > 0. The intercept 𝜙0 stands for the degree of monopoly in the banking system. We
follow Charles (2008) and assume that the risk premium is positively related to the debt-capital ratio.
From the perspective of the bankers, and assuming the size of all firms of the economy are identical, the
higher the firms’ debt as a proportion of their stock of capital, the higher the default risk perceived by the
banks, and hence the higher the risk and liquidity premium lenders will require in order to financing new
capital goods. Accordingly, the increasing risk, from the lenders’ standpoint, due to a raising debt-capital
ratio can be seen as a constraint to the supply of loans to firms and hence to the process of capital
accumulation itself. This mechanism is inspired by Kalecki’s (1937) principle of increasing risk.
According to the author, as investments grow, this happens because: i) the greater is the investment the
more is his wealth position endangered in the event of unsuccessful business; ii) the greater is the
investment the more is the danger of illiquidity. Even though, in this case, Kalecki’s (1937) principle
refers to the risk perception from the firms’ standpoint, in this work we suggest it also can be used to
understand how lenders perceive risk. As Kalecki himself pointed out, “[i]f, however, the entrepreneur is
not cautious in his investment activity it is the creditor who imposes on his calculation the burden of
increasing risk charging the successive portions of credits above a certain amount with rising rate of
interest” (Kalecki, 1937, p. 442). Moreover, it is worth noting that in this work the principle of increasing
risk is not used with respect to the capital stock, as in Kalecki (1937). Instead, here, this principle is
associated with the proportion of capital goods financed by loans in the total capital stock. In this way, a
more accurate relationship can be stablished between the capital accumulation and the borrowers’
solvency, as perceived by lenders. The equation (12) also assumes that the capacity utilization is
positively related to the risk premium (Lima and Meirelles, 2007). More buoyant demand conditions
reduce the bank’s liquidity preference and hence lower 𝜙.
   By assuming that the risk and liquidity premia is positively related to changes in the amount of credit
granted to firms, we follow the Post-Keynesian structuralist endogenous money theory (Minsky, 1975;
Palley, 1996). Here it is assumed that any increase in the demand for loans and, consequently, deposits
with commercial banks is fully accommodated by the central bank’s supply of monetary reserves. This
assumption falls in line with the horizontalist view developed by Kaldor (1982) and Lavoie (1984).
However, unlike the horizontalist view, where the risk and liquidity premium set by commercial banks
over the benchmark interest rate is unaffected by increasing credit demand, we follow the structuralists by
claiming that, as the credit supply granted to firms increase, commercial banks start to worry about the
liquidity of their own portfolios and of their borrowers. This leads commercial banks to restrict the
amount of loans by raising the market interest rate. In other words, it is assumed that an increase in the
credit supply granted to firms increases the liquidity and risk premia of commercial banks, even if the
base rate set by the central bank remains constant2. Following Hein (2008), Figure 1 represents the
structuralist endogenous money theory with complete accommodation of the central bank.

where 𝐵 𝑆 and 𝐵 𝐷 are the supply and demand for loans respectively, 𝐷 is the deposits with commercial
banks, 𝑀 is the money reserves and 𝑀 𝑆 is the money supply. Figure 1 illustrates how the demand for
credit creates deposits which, in turn, make reserves.
    Nevertheless, borrowers and lenders may disagree about how much credit should be granted to firms
(Wolfson, 1996). There is a difference between the firms’ demand for loans, according to the firms’ own
perception, and the firms’ demand for loans, from the rentiers’ standpoint. In Figure 2 below the
borrower’s demand for credit is represented by the notional demand curve, 𝐵 𝐷𝑁 , and the credit demand
by creditworthy borrowers from the lender’s perspective is represented by the effective demand curve,
𝐵 𝐷𝐸 . This difference exists because, in a scenario of fundamental uncertainty, borrowers and lenders tend
to form asymmetric expectations about the future. By fundamental uncertainty, we mean that, due to
sudden and constant transformations in the world, there is always a great amount of information about the
future that cannot be known ex ante by decision makers, since the future is yet to be created; therefore,
probabilities, whether objective or subjective, cannot be attributed to a list of possible future events as this
list itself cannot be known3. In this scenario, banks manage to set a series of creditworthiness criteria
based on, for instance, the expected profitability of the investment project to be financed, the value of the
firms’ collateral, the firms’ past projects history, and so on. However, the capacity of lenders to
thoroughly evaluate the firms’ demand for loans that maximises firms’ rate of capital accumulation and
rentiers income in an environment where decision makers face fundamental uncertainty with respect to
the outcomes of current investments remains partly subjective. In this scenario, rentiers may constrain the
amount of credit granted to firms even when still there are profitable investment projects to be
undertaken. If banks relax those creditworthiness criteria, the risk premium and the market interest rate
are reduced, thus allowing an increase in the firms’ demand for loans, which raises total profits and
capital accumulation. However, if banks relax excessively those criteria, then credit will be granted to
firms that should be turned down.

                                                       [FIGURE 2]

Figure 2 illustrates an economy where banks are more risk-averse than firms. At a given market interest
rate 𝑖0 banks are willing to grant credit to firms up to the point 𝐵𝐸 , which means that 𝐵𝐸 𝐵𝑁 is equal to the
amount of credit rationed. Commercial banks will refuse to finance any investments beyond this point,
regardless of the firm’s predisposition to pay higher interest rates, up to 𝑖1 . Note that the gap between the
effective and the notional demand curves widens as the interest rate increases; it happens because the
higher the interest rate the more difficult it is for borrowers to pay their debts4.
   Even though it is more plausible to assume that banks are more risk-averse than firms, as the latter
tend to be more optimistic about their investments whereas the former is usually more prudent, we can
imagine that there are times when we find the opposite. This phenomenon is particularly true during
periods of crisis, preceded by a rapid expansion of credit. The optimism in the economic boom is abruptly
stopped during the crisis, causing the Central Bank to act in an attempt to prevent (or minimise the effect
of) credit crunch. However, even in the event of a quick and effective action of the monetary authorities
in containing these effects on the financial system, there is no guarantee that firms are willing to take on
new debt. It is worth mentioning that in such situations in which the Central Bank was able to re-establish
the conditions of liquidity and solvency of the banking sector and hence make it apt to the beginning of a
new credit cycle, it is possible that firms still evaluate more carefully the use of external funds. The
increased uncertainty generated by the crisis and the possible need to reduce debt in a context which is
expected a fall in future demand mean that, despite the recovery of the banking system and liquidity
offered, firms are afraid to take more external financing. The following proverb captures with relative
accuracy this general framework: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink”.

  According to New Keynesians, it may also happen due to adverse selection problem. Higher interest rates attract mostly firms
willing to undertake excessively risky investments and with no intention to refund the loan in case the profits obtained from
these investments are insufficient (Wolfson, 1996).
                                                              5
2.3 Capital accumulation

Now we assume that the rate of capital accumulation desired by firms depends on the profit rate retained
by firms, and a quadratic function of the debt-capital ratio. The linear function of the capital accumulation
plans is given by

          Δ𝐾 𝐼
   𝑔𝑑 =     = = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 (𝑟 − 𝑖𝜆) + 𝛼2 (𝜓 − 𝜆)𝜆                                                (13)
          𝐾  𝐾

where 𝛼0 , 𝛼1 , 𝛼2 , 𝜓 > 0. Following Kalecki (1971) and Dutt (1984) we argue that the higher the expected
profit rate, the higher the propensity of firms to invest. For convenience, we assume that profits expected
by firms are equal to current profits. Assuming a bank-based financial system, there are two main forms
in which capital goods can be financed: internal funds constituted by retained profits and external funds
constituted by debts. Hein (2007) claims that the debt-capital ratio, associated with the interest rate, can
only have a negative impact on investments due to its discount effect on profits. More formally, in Hein
(2007) and Hein (2008), the partial effect of an increased debt-capital ratio on investments is negative.
   Contrastingly, other things held constant, in equation (13) we assume that, in the space (𝜆, 𝑔𝑑 ), 𝑔𝑑 is
concave down on its relevant domain 𝜆 ∈ ℝ+ . In this quadratic term we also find the parameter 𝜓. An
increase in the entrepreneurs’ animal spirit, higher expected and current profit rates, and more favourable
demand conditions tend to encourage borrowers to take more risks and increase the demand for loans,
which in turn raises the value of 𝜓. More formally, it can be said that 𝜓 can be better described by an
implicit function 𝜓(𝜓0 , 𝑟, 𝑢) where 𝜓0 is the entrepreneurs’ animal spirit. However, let us assume 𝜓 is
constant and normalised to unity (𝜓 = 1) – this assumption can be relaxed at the expense of simplicity.
With this assumption we can focus more on the effects of credit rationing on the dynamics of the
economy. Figure 3 below illustrates equation (13) in the space (𝜆, 𝑔𝑑 ), as follows

                                                 [FIGURE 3]

In this context, prime investments financed by credit manage to boost profits and capital accumulation. In
this stage, within the solvency region, an increase in the amount of loans to firms boosts retained profits
and capital accumulation. Firms’ willingness to borrow more money increases, and so does the
investment rate. This dynamics goes until firms reach the critical debt-capital ratio where any additional
credit granted to firms is only enough to sustain the maximum rate of capital accumulation. If firms
continue to borrow money, any increase in the debt-capital ratio beyond its critical point will reduce
firms’ retained profits and the investment rate; in this case, firms will fall into the default region. In other
words, the principle of increasing risk also holds from the firms’ standpoint. However, as aforementioned,
there is an important qualification with respect to Kalecki’s (1937) original use of the principle of
increasing risk. Either from the perspective of lenders or from the perspective of borrowers, here, the risk
increases due to a raising debt-capital ratio instead of the expansion of the capital stock. It follows from
that that there is a debt-capital ratio, 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑔𝑑 , that maximises the aggregate investment rate, other things
held constant. However, in an environment of fundamental uncertainty, it is impossible for borrowers and
lenders to know the maximum amount of loans granted to firms that guarantees solvency over time.

2.4 Aggregate saving

Assuming that excess capacity prevails, capacity utilization adjusts to equalise investments and savings.
In this scenario, we have

   𝑔𝑠 =     =                                                                                 (14)

(5) and (6), we obtain

      = 𝑠𝑐    = 𝑠𝑐           = 𝑠𝑐 [𝑟 − 𝑖𝜆]                                                 (15)

   𝑔 𝑠 = 𝑠𝑐 [𝑟 − 𝑖𝜆] + 𝑠𝑓 𝑖𝜆 = 𝑠𝑐 𝑟 + (𝑠𝑓 − 𝑠𝑐 )𝑖𝜆                                         (17)

Assuming, for simplicity, 𝑠𝑓 = 𝑠𝑐 , we obtain the so-called Cambridge equation

   𝑔 𝑠 = 𝑠𝑐 𝑟                                                                              (18)

2.5 The goods market equilibrium capacity utilization and growth

When there is excess capacity, capacity utilization adjusts to equalise the desired and the actual rates of
capital accumulation so that in the goods market equilibrium we have 𝑔𝑑 = 𝑔 𝑠 . From equations (18),
(13), (12), (11) and (4), we have

   𝛼0 + 𝛼1 [(1 − 𝜎)𝑢 − (𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆 − 𝜙2 𝑢)𝜆] + 𝛼2 (1 − 𝜆)𝜆 = 𝑠𝑐 (1 − 𝜎)𝑢              (19)

Solving for 𝑢 we have the equilibrium capacity utilization:

          𝛼0 − (𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆)𝜆 + 𝛼2 (1 − 𝜆)𝜆
   𝑢∗ =                                                                                    (20)
                (𝑠𝑐 − 𝛼1 )(1 − 𝜎) − 𝛼1 𝜙2 𝜆

The stability conditions for the equation above is (𝑠𝑐 − 𝛼1 )(1 − 𝜎) − 𝛼1 𝜙2 𝜆 > 0. Since 𝑢∗ ∈ (0,1) the
inequality 𝛼0 + 𝛼2 (1 − 𝜆)𝜆 > (𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆)𝜆 must be fulfilled. From equation (20), we can see that
the partial derivatives 𝑢𝜎∗ > 0 and 𝑢𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 < 0 are unambiguously signed. As for the partial 𝑢𝜆∗ , other things
being equal, since the quadratic term of the equation (20) is negative, there must be a critical value of
debt-capital ratio in the relevant domain, say 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑢∗ , that maximises 𝑢∗ . Therefore, if 𝜆 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑢∗ , then
𝑢𝜆∗ > 0; and if 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑢∗ < 𝜆, then 𝑢𝜆∗ < 0.
    If we substitute the equation (20) either in (18) or in (13), we obtain the equilibrium investment rate.
Thus, plugging (20) and (4) into (18), we obtain

          𝑠𝑐 (1 − 𝜎)[𝛼0 − (𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆)𝜆 + 𝛼2 (1 − 𝜆)𝜆]
   𝑔∗ =                                                                                    (21)
                      (𝑠𝑐 − 𝛼1 )(1 − 𝜎) − 𝛼1 𝜙2 𝜆

Equation (21) follows the same conditions of stability and existence of equation (20). Like the goods
market equilibrium capacity utilization, 𝑢∗ , we can also say that there must be a critical value, say 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 ,
that maximises the equilibrium rate of investment. From equation (21), we can see that the partial
derivatives can be signed as 𝑔𝜎∗ = 𝑠𝑐 [(1 − 𝜎)𝑢𝜎∗ − 𝑢∗ ] ≷ 0, 𝑔𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 < 0, and 𝑔𝜆∗ > 0 for 𝜆 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 and
𝑔𝜆∗ < 0 for 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 < 𝜆. Equation (21) is also represented by an inverted U-shaped curve as in Figure 3. The

                                                     7
only difference now is that equation (21) describes the equilibrium investment rate, 𝑔∗ , instead of the
aggregate investment function, 𝑔𝑑 . Please note that, since 𝑔∗ = 𝑠𝑐 𝑟 ∗, the critical values that maximise the
investment and profit rates under the goods market equilibrium condition are the same.

3    Monetary policy and long-run inflation rate

In this section we will analyse the impact of changes in the interest rate on the long-run inflation rate.

3.1 Wages

Following Dutt (1994), we claim the growth rate of nominal wages is positively related to the gap
between the wage share desired by workers (𝜎𝑤 ) and the actual wage share, as follows

    𝑤 = 𝛽𝑤 (𝜎𝑤 − 𝜎)                                                                          (22)

where 𝑤 is the rate of change in the nominal wage, 𝛽𝑤 > 0 is a parameter.
   The wage share desired by workers depends on bargaining power of workers which, in turn, is
positively related to the rate of employment. A tighter labour market increases the bargaining power of
workers. Following Hein and Stockhammer (2011), let us assume a proportional relationship between the
rate of employment and the rate of capacity utilization.
Thus, we can say that there is a positive relationship between the rate of capacity utilization and the wage
share desired by workers, as follows

    𝜎𝑤 = 𝛽𝑢                                                                                  (23)

where 𝛽 is a constant.

3.2 Prices

Drawing upon the work of Kalecki (1971), we state that in an oligopolistic market firms set the price level
(𝑃) according to a mark-up (𝜇) over prime costs. Therefore, at a point in time, price level is given by

                  𝑊    1
    𝑃 = (1 + 𝜆)     ⇒     =𝜎                                                                 (24)
                  𝑎   1+𝜇

Equation (24) demonstrates an inverse relationship between mark-up and the wage share.
  At a point in time the price level is given by the equation (24), but over time we follow Dutt (1994)
and hence the inflation rate can be given by

    𝑝 = 𝛾𝑚 (𝜎 − 𝜎𝑐 )                                                                         (25)

where 𝑝 is the rate of inflation, that is, the inflation rate, 𝛾𝑚 > 0 is a parameter, and 𝜎𝑐 is the wage share
desired by firms. Equation (25) states that the larger the gap between the actual wage share and the wage
share desired by firms, the larger the gap between the actual mark-up and the mark-up desired by firms.
   Given the introduction of interest in the model, the mark-up must be able to cover the profits of
enterprises and interest payments. Hence, the mark-up and the wage share desired by firms change due to
two factors, i.e., the capacity utilization and the interest payments, as follows

    𝜎𝑐 = 𝛾0 − 𝛾1 𝑢 − 𝛾2 𝑖𝜆                                                                   (26)



                                                      8
where 𝛾0 , 𝛾1 , 𝛾2 > 0 are parameters. Firms will be able to set a higher mark-up and hence a lower 𝜎𝑐 if
they increase their perception of their monopoly power. It is assumed here without loss of generality that
𝛾1 > 0, since a stronger demand increases the capacity utilization, and thus encourage firms to target a
lower 𝜎𝑐 . Nonetheless, it is worth noting that Kalecki (1954) also argued that an increase in the excess
capacity could induce firms to increase the mark-up because of an increase in overhead costs, thereby
implying that 𝛾1 < 0. An increase in interest payments also increases the overhead costs, which may or
may not induce firms to raise their mark-up. Here the mark-up is interest-elastic, as we are assuming
𝛾2 > 0.
   Substituting equation (26) in (25), we obtain

   𝑝 = 𝛾𝑚 (𝜎 − 𝛾0 + 𝛾1 𝑢 + 𝛾2 𝑖𝜆)                                                              (27)

Equation (27) describes the extended inflation rate equation. If there exists excess capacity, then 𝑢 = 𝑢∗ ,
as discussed in equations (19) and (20). Since 𝑢∗ is a function of 𝜎, 𝜆 and 𝑖𝐶𝐵 , if we want to demonstrate
the impact of the interest rate on the inflation rate, then we must be able to analyse first how changes in
the interest rate set by the Central Bank affect the long-run dynamics between the wage share, 𝜎, and the
debt-capital ratio, 𝜆.

3.3 The long-run dynamics between the wage share and the debt-capital ratio

Let us now take the differential of 𝜆 with respect to time. From equation (6), we have

   𝜆̇ = 𝜆(𝐵̇ − 𝑔)                                                                              (28)

Since the variation in the credit granted to firms is equal to the rentier’s saving, we have

                               𝐵̇
   𝐵̇ = 𝑆𝑓 = 𝑠𝑓 Π𝑓 = 𝑠𝑓 𝑖𝐵 ⇒      = 𝑠𝑓 𝑖 = 𝑠𝑐 𝑖                                                (29)
                               𝐵

Substituting (29), (21), (12), and (11) in (28), we have

   𝜆̇ = 𝜆𝑠𝑐 [(𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆 − 𝜙2 𝑢∗ ) − (1 − 𝜎)𝑢∗ ]                                          (30)

It follows from equation (3) that the differential of the wage share with respect to time is given by

   𝜎̇ = 𝜎(𝑤 − 𝑝 − 𝑎̇ )                                                                         (31)

where 𝑎̇ are the rate of change of the labour productivity, 𝑎. Substituting (26), (25), (23), (22), and also
assuming for simplicity that 𝑎̇ = 0, that is, the labour productivity remains constant over time, and
𝑢 = 𝑢∗ , we obtain

   𝜎̇ = 𝜎{𝛽𝑤 (𝛽𝑢∗ − 𝜎) − 𝛾𝑚 [𝜎 − 𝛾0 + 𝛾1 𝑢∗ + 𝛾2 𝜆(𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆 − 𝜙2 𝑢∗ )]}                 (32)

In the long run both the wage share and the debt-capital ratio stabilise, that is, 𝜆̇ = 𝜎̇ = 0. Since both loci
𝜆̇ = 𝜎̇ = 0 yield equations of third degree, we can have up to three solutions of the non-linear dynamical
system on the relevant domain. Hence, let us assume for convenience that there exists two distinct non-
trivial solutions to the system, where (𝜆, 𝜎) = (𝜆𝐸1 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝜎𝐸1 ) and (𝜆, 𝜎) = (𝜆𝐸2 > 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝜎𝐸2 ) for all
𝜆 ∈ ℝ+ . It is worth noting that, by assuming 𝜆𝐸 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , we are saying that the financial structure of the
firms is in the solvency region; if 𝜆𝐸 > 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , then firms are in the default region. That said, the Jacobian
matrix of partial derivatives of the dynamical system constituted by equations (30) and (32) is given by

           𝜕𝜎

where ℎ = 𝛽𝑤 𝛽 − 𝛾𝑚 (𝛾1 − 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 ) > 0, which means it is assumed that the responsiveness of wages
(𝛽𝑤 𝛽) and market interest rate (𝛾𝑚 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 ) outweigh the elasticity of mark-up (𝛾𝑚 𝛾1 ) to changes in the
capacity utilization. In fact, none of the partial derivatives above can be unambiguously signed.
Therefore, in order to examine the stability conditions of the system we must impose some constraints
over the parameters.
   Let us examine equation (33). Even though the sign of 𝐽11 can go either way, the stability condition of
the partial differential (33) requires that an increase in the debt-capital ratio share reduces its own growth
rate. Formally, this stability condition is satisfied if the following inequality holds: (𝑖 + 𝜙1 𝜆) − 𝜙2 𝜆𝑢𝜆∗ −
(1 − 𝜎)(𝑢𝜆∗ + 𝑢∗ ) < 0. If the economy is in the solvency region on the relevant domain, that is, 𝜆𝐸 <
𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , then it is more likely that this inequality will be satisfied, as 𝑢𝜆∗ > 0; it means that the positive
impacts of an increase in the debt-capital ratio on investments exceed the increase in the premium risk.
Alternatively, if the economy is in the default region, that is, 𝜆𝐸 > 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 and hence 𝑢𝜆∗ < 0, then it is more
likely that 𝐽11 will be positive.
   In equation (34) we assume the condition [𝜙2 + (1 − 𝜎)]𝑢𝜎∗ > 𝑢∗ is satisfied, and hence the partial
𝐽12 = 𝜕𝜆̇⁄𝜎 is negative. Given 𝑢𝜎∗ > 0, an increase in the capacity utilization caused by a raise in real
wages encourage lenders to reduce the risk premium set over the Central Bank interest rate; increased real
wages also contracts (expands) the rate of investments in a profit-led (wage-led) economy. Assuming
without loss of generality that the economy is profit led, the inequality above is satisfied if the increase in
the capacity utilization, induced by a redistribution of income in favour of labour, reduces more the risk
premium and the market interest rate than it decreases the rate of capital accumulation. In a wage-led
economy, on the other hand, it is more likely to find 𝐽12 = 𝜕𝜆̇⁄𝜎 < 0, as an increase in 𝜎 reduces 𝑖 and
increases 𝑔∗ simultaneously.
   Equation (35) is also ambiguously signed. Note that if the term |𝛾𝑚 𝛾2 (𝑖 + 𝜙1 𝜆)| is sufficiently large in
absolute value, then the differential (35) is negative for all 𝜆 on the relevant domain. However, since we
want to isolate the effect of increased indebtedness of firms on prices and capital accumulation, let us
assume for convenience that |ℎ𝑢𝜆∗ | > |𝛾𝑚 𝛾2 (𝑖 + 𝜙1 𝜆)| for all 𝜆 ∈ ℝ+ . If this inequality is satisfied, and
also assuming ℎ > 0, then the sign of 𝐽21 depends exclusively on the sign of 𝑢𝜆∗ . It follows from equation
(20) that if 𝜆 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , then 𝑢𝜆∗ > 0 and 𝐽21 > 0, which means that an increase in 𝜆 boosts 𝑢∗ and hence
raises more wages than prices; and if 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 < 𝜆, then 𝑢𝜆∗ < 0 and 𝐽21 < 0, implying that an increase in 𝜆
reduces 𝑢∗ and hence lower more wages than prices.
   Lastly, in equation (36), the sign of 𝜕𝜎̇ ⁄𝜎 can go either way. However, the stability condition requires
that an increase in the wage share reduces its own growth rate. Hence, the following condition must be
satisfied: ℎ(𝑢𝜎∗ 𝜎 + 𝑢∗ ) + 𝛾𝑚 𝛾0 < 𝛾𝑚 𝛾2 𝜆(𝑖 + 𝜙2 𝑢∗ ) + 2(𝛽𝑤 𝛽 + 𝛾𝑚 )𝜎. Please note that if the parameters
measuring the speed of adjustment of the gaps between the actual wage share and the wage shares desired
by workers and capitalists is large enough, 𝛽𝑤 and 𝛾𝑚 , then the stability condition is fulfilled. A higher
interest rate also helps to stabilise equation (36), as it increases mark-up and hence reduces the growth of
real wages. Nonetheless, it is worth saying that satisfying this inequality is a necessary, but it is not
sufficient condition to achieve stability for the whole system. It means that, even if a higher interest rate
stabilises the equation (36), it does not necessarily stabilises the whole system of dynamical equations. In
fact, as demonstrated below, it is the opposite, that is, a sufficiently high interest rate destabilises that
system.

                                                      10
   Let us analyse now the conditions under which the dynamical system is stable. Since, by assumption,
𝐽11 < 0, 𝐽12 < 0 and 𝐽22 < 0, we can say that the stability of the system depends on the sign of 𝐽21 .
Thus, we must examine both cases, that is, 𝐽21 > 0 and 𝐽21 < 0.
   In the solvency region, where 𝜆𝐸 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑢𝜆∗ > 0, we have 𝐽21 > 0. Since the trace and the
determinant of the Jacobian matrix constituted by the partials (33) – (36) are 𝑇𝑟(𝐽) = 𝐽11 + 𝐽22 < 0 and
𝐷(𝐽) = 𝐽11 𝐽22 − 𝐽21 𝐽12 > 0 respectively, the system is stable around the equilibrium point (𝜆, 𝜎) =
(𝜆𝐸1 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝜎𝐸1 ). In the default region, on the other hand, 𝜆𝐸 > 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑢𝜆∗ < 0, thus implying that
𝐽21 < 0. Note that if 𝑢𝜆∗ < 0, it is more likely that 𝐽11 will become positive. Therefore, assuming 𝐽21 < 0
and 𝐽11 > 0, the trace 𝑇𝑟(𝐽) = 𝐽11 + 𝐽22 cannot be unambiguously signed anymore. However, since the
determinant 𝐷(𝐽) = 𝐽11 𝐽22 − 𝐽21 𝐽12 is negative, the equilibrium point (𝜆, 𝜎) = (𝜆𝐸2 > 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝜎𝐸2 ) is a
saddle-point.
   Figure 4 below presents the phase-diagram of the dynamical system. Both loci 𝜆̇ = 𝜎̇ = 0 can be
represented by a third-degree equation. In equation (30), 𝜆̇ = 0, the cubic term is positive, whereas in
equation (32), 𝜎̇ = 0, it is negative. In the solvency region, where we have 𝐽21 > 0, the locus 𝜆̇ = 0 is
downward sloping around the stable equilibrium point, as − 𝐽11 ⁄𝐽12 is negative; whereas, given 𝐽11 < 0,
the local slope of the locus 𝜎̇ = 0, that is, − 𝐽21 ⁄𝐽22 , is positive around the stable equilibrium. In the
default region, where 𝐽21 < 0 and 𝐽11 > 0, the locus 𝜆̇ = 0 is upward sloping, since − 𝐽11 ⁄𝐽12 > 0;
whereas the locus 𝜎̇ = 0 in this region is now downward slopping around the solution of the system, and
hence − 𝐽21 ⁄𝐽22 < 0 becomes positive.

                                                [FIGURE 4]

Before we finish this subsection, we must pose the following question: what happens if the economy is in
the saddle-point equilibrium? Any disturbance in the system that shifts the equilibrium solution to the left
of 𝜆𝐸2 will make the system move towards the stable equilibrium in the solvency region. However, if any
displacement in the equilibrium solution shifts the system to the right of 𝜆𝐸2 , then the system will fall into
a trajectory of low wage share and ever-increasing debt-capital ratio. In this scenario, expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies can bring the system back to the stable equilibrium in the solvency region.
By reducing the benchmark interest rate the Central Bank simultaneously reduces the growth rate of loans
and raises the firm’s retained profit, thus boosting capital accumulation; ergo, the expansionary monetary
policy reduces 𝜆 by decreasing 𝐵̇⁄𝐵 and increasing 𝑔∗ . If we assume that 𝛼0 in the aggregate investment
function (13) is the government expending relative to the capital stock, then an expansionary fiscal policy
increases the equilibrium capacity utilization, foments investments and hence also helps to reduce 𝜆.
Therefore, in an unstable economy, expansionary monetary and fiscal policies bring the system back to
the solvency region by reducing the firm’s indebtedness.

3.4 The impact of the interest rate on the wage share and the debt-capital ratio: a comparative
    static analysis

In this subsection we analyse how changes in the interest rate affects the wage share and the debt-capital
ratio. To do this, we assume the parameters of the model satisfy the conditions of stability around the
equilibrium point (𝜆, 𝜎) = (𝜆𝐸1 < 𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝜎𝐸1 ) presented in Figure 4. That said, the dynamical system
constituted by equations (30) and (32) in the loci 𝜆̇ = 𝜎̇ = 0 is given by

   𝜆̇| 0 = 𝜆𝑠𝑐 [(𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆 − 𝜙2 𝑢∗ ) − (1 − 𝜎)𝑢∗ ]                                    (37)
   𝜎̇ | 0 = 𝜎{𝛽𝑤 (𝛽𝑢∗ − 𝜎) − 𝛾𝑚 [𝜎 − 𝛾0 + 𝛾1 𝑢∗ + 𝛾2 𝜆(𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆 − 𝜙2 𝑢∗ )]}          (38)

Taking the differential with respect to 𝜆, 𝜎 and 𝑖𝐶𝐵 , and substituting the equations (33) – (36) in the
differential, we have

   𝐽11 𝑑𝜆 + 𝐽12 𝑑𝜎 = −𝐴𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵                                                                  (39)

where, given 𝑢𝑖∗ < 0, we have 𝐴 = [𝜆𝑠𝑐 (𝜎 − 𝜙2 )𝑢𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 ] ≷ 0 and 𝐵 = (ℎ𝑢𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 − 𝛾𝑚 𝛾2 𝜆) < 0.
  If we rearrange the equations (39) and (40) in matrix notation and invert the system,5 we obtain

        𝑑𝜆⁄𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵      1     𝐽           −𝐽12 −𝐴
    [           ]=       [ 22              ][ ]                                                             (41)
        𝑑𝜎⁄𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵    2𝐷(𝐽)  −𝐽 21        𝐽11 −𝐵

From (41) we obtain the simultaneous impact of a raise in the interest rate on the wage share and the debt-
capital ratio. Here we must bear in mind that the determinant, 𝐷(𝐽), is positive, and that the stability
condition implies 𝐽11 , 𝐽12 , 𝐽22 < 0 and 𝐽21 > 0. As we can see, the sign of the term 𝐴 can go either way,
which means we have two distinct possible cases, that is, 𝐴 > 0, 𝐵 < 0 and 𝐴 < 0, 𝐵 < 0. To keep it
short, only the first case will be discussed in detail here without loss of generality. The alternative case is
presented briefly in the appendix.
   Therefore, given 𝐴 > 0 and 𝐵 < 0, the impact of a change in the interest rate on the wage share and

Figure 5 portrays the possible scenarios following from the differentials (42) and (43). The slopes of the
curves in the loci 𝜆̇ = 𝜎̇ = 0 are essentially the same as in Figure 4.
   We must now analyse how a raise in the interest rate shifts both curves 𝜆̇ = 𝜎̇ = 0. It follows from
equation (39) that a change in the interest rate changes the intercept of the curve 𝜆̇ = 0 at the rate
−𝐴⁄𝐽12 > 0. In other words, a raise in the interest rate shifts the curve 𝜆̇ = 0 upwards. From equation
(40) it can be seen that an increase in the interest rate shifts the curve 𝜎̇ = 0 downwards, as −𝐵⁄𝐽22 < 0.
   Let us first analyse the unequivocal direct relationship between the interest rate and the debt-capital
ratio in Figure 5. As for the relationship between interest rate and debt-capital ratio, 𝜆 = 𝐵⁄𝐾 , we must
keep in mind that, given 𝐵̇ = 𝑠𝑓 𝑖 = 𝑠𝑓 (𝑖𝐶𝐵 + 𝜙0 + 𝜙1 𝜆 − 𝜙2 𝑢∗ ), an increase in the benchmark interest
rate (𝑖𝐶𝐵 ) by the Central Bank always increases the growth rate of the firms’ outstanding debt, as
𝜕𝐵̇⁄𝜕𝑖𝐶𝐵 = 𝑠𝑓 (1 − 𝜙2 𝑢𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 ) > 0 where 𝑢𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 < 0. Besides, in equation (21), it is demonstrated that an
increased interest rate impacts negatively on the equilibrium investment rate (𝑔𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 < 0), as it reduces the
capacity utilization (𝑢𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 < 0) and the retained profits of firms by increasing the interest payments in
favour of rentiers. Ergo, an increased interest rate expands 𝐵, reduces 𝑔∗ , and hence unequivocally raises
the debt-capital ratio 𝜆.
   Now we examine the ambiguous impact of the interest rate on the wage share as presented in Figure 5.
Let us examine first the impact of changes in the capacity utilization on the wage share. Since we assume
that wages plus the risk premium are more elastic than prices to changes in the capacity utilization, that is,
ℎ > 0, the partial effect of an increase (decrease) in the capacity utilization also increases (decreases) the
wage share. We know from equation (20) that the partial impact of an increased interest rate on the
capacity utilization is negative, 𝑢𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 < 0; on the other hand, as the curve 𝜆̇ = 0 moves upwards along the
5
 Let A be a 2x2 matrix and x and b be 2x1 matrices. If it is so, then the non-trivial solution of the linear system Ax=b is given
by x=A-1 b, where A-1 = (1⁄𝐷(A))𝑎𝑑𝑗A.
                                                               12
curve 𝜎̇ = 0 after an increase in the interest rate, 𝜆 raises and affects positively the capacity utilization,
𝑢𝜆∗ > 0, in the solvency region, as also demonstrated in equation (20). Therefore, the net effect of interest
rate shocks on the rate of capacity utilization is ambiguous. If the net impact of an increased interest rate
on the capacity utilization is negative, then real wages drop and income is redistributed in favour of
capitalists. Moreover, the increase in 𝜆 and 𝑖 also increases the firms’ overhead costs, forcing
entrepreneurs to set a higher mark-up over prime costs which, in turn, leads to higher inflation and
reinforces the fall in the real wages. In Figure 5, this is the case where an increase in the interest rate
shifts the initial equilibrium towards the solution (𝜆, 𝜎) = (𝜆′𝐸 , 𝜎𝐸′ ). Contrastingly, if the positive partial
effect of an increased debt-capital ratio on the capacity utilization, 𝑢𝜆∗ , is sufficiently large so that it
overcompensates the negative partial effect of 𝑖𝐶𝐵 on real wages, then a raise in the interest rate can in
fact increase real wages, and hence the wage share. This case is a theoretical possibility, even though,
from experience, it seems highly unlikely that a raise in the interest rate also raises the wage share. We
have this scenario when the initial equilibrium is displaced towards the solution (𝜆, 𝜎) = (𝜆′′𝐸 , 𝜎𝐸′′ ), as
portrayed in Figure 5, after a raise in the interest rate.

3.5 The net impact of an interest rate shock on the long-run inflation rate

This subsection seeks to examine the conditions under which Central Banks can efficiently use interest
rates to steer price increases. To do so, we analyse the transmission channels through which an interest
rate shock affects the inflation rate. Equation (27) describes the inflation rate as a function of the wage
share, the debt-capital ratio, and the interest rate. By taking the differential of the inflation rate with
respect to the interest rate we have

    𝑑𝑝   𝜕𝑝 𝑑𝜎   𝜕𝑝 𝑑𝜆   𝜕𝑝
       =       +       +                                                                       (44)
   𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵 𝜕𝜎 𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵 𝜕𝜆 𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵 𝜕𝑖𝐶𝐵

where 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕𝜎 = (1 + 𝛾1 − 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 )𝑢𝜎∗ , 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕𝜆 = [(𝛾1 − 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 )𝑢𝜆∗ + 𝛾2 (𝑖 + 𝜆𝜙1 )], and 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕 𝑖𝐶𝐵 =
(𝑑𝜎⁄𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵 ) + 𝛾2 𝜆 + (𝛾1 − 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 )𝑢𝑖∗𝐶𝐵 . Since none of the partial differentials are unambiguously signed,
we must set some constraints over the parameters. By assuming 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕𝜎 > 0, we are saying that, in
equilibrium, the partial effect of a raise in the wage share on the inflation rate is positively, as the wage
increases the prime costs of the firms. If 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕𝜆 > 0, then the partial effect of an increase in the debt-
capital ratio also increases the amount of interest payments from firms to rentiers, thus forcing the former
to raise the mark-up. Lastly, let us assume, for simplicity, that the absolute value of 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕 𝑖𝐶𝐵 is
negligible.
   Equation (44) shows that the net impact of a raise in the interest rate on prices is ambiguous. Let us
assume, without loss of generality, that an increase in the interest rate displaces the initial equilibrium
solution (𝜆𝐸 , 𝜎𝐸 ) towards the new equilibrium (𝜆′𝐸 , 𝜎𝐸 ′) instead of (𝜆′′𝐸 , 𝜎𝐸′′ ), as shown in Figure 5. That
said, we want to know the net impact of an interest rate shock on inflation when such an increase in the
interest rate raises the debt-capital ratio, 𝜆′𝐸 − 𝜆𝐸 > 0, and reduces the wage share, 𝜎𝐸′ − 𝜎𝐸 < 0
simultaneously. In this case, the Central Banks can only reduce inflation by raising interest rates if the
following condition is satisfied

                           𝑑𝜎                                           𝑑𝜆
   (1 + 𝛾1 − 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 )𝑢𝜎∗ |     | > [(𝛾1 − 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 )𝑢𝜆∗ + 𝛾2 (𝑖 + 𝜆𝜙1 )]                          (45)
                          𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵                                         𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵

that is, if 𝑑𝑝⁄𝑑 𝑖𝐶𝐵 < 0, then the inequality (45) is fulfilled. From equations (42) and (43) we know that,
when the solution of the system shifts from (𝜆𝐸 , 𝜎𝐸 ) towards (𝜆′𝐸 , 𝜎𝐸 ′), we have 𝑑𝜎⁄𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵 < 0 and
𝑑𝜆⁄𝑑𝑖𝐶𝐵 > 0. Please note that if the initial level of the market interest rate is sufficiently high, then the
right-hand side of the inequality (45) becomes greater than the left-hand side, and hence the condition
above is not fulfilled. It means that the simple use of interest rates as a monetary policy tool to control
inflation is self-undermining. That is, if Central Banks successively raise the benchmark interest rates,
                                                       13
then firms will be forced to increasingly set higher mark-ups over prime costs, hence boosting inflation.
Furthermore, countries with a sufficiently high initial level of interest rates might not be able to promote a
successful reduction in inflation by raising interest rates, if such an initial level of the market interest rate
does not fulfill the condition (45). This case is of paramount importance for undeveloped countries, such
as Brazil and Turkey for instance, where interest rates tend to be exceedingly high. The same conclusions
we drew for the initial level of interest rates also hold for the initial level of the debt-capital ratio, as the
greater the 𝜆, the lesser the left-hand side of inequality (45). It basically means that if firms in the
economy are heavily indebted, then an increase in the interest rate also increases the interest payments
from firms to rentiers, which forces the formers to raise mark-ups and prices.
   Figures 6 and 7 below illustrate two possible scenarios we can obtain when a raise in the benchmark
interest rate reduces the wage share and increases the debt-capital ratio. Based on a linear approximation
described in equation (44), in the first quadrant we plotted the iso-inflation curves in the system (𝜆, 𝜎).
Note that, for convenience, we assume that 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕 𝑖𝐶𝐵 is negligible. If 𝜕𝑝⁄𝜕 𝑖𝐶𝐵 < 0, for instance, then an
increase in the interest rate reduces the value of the iso-inflation curve for constant levels of the wage
share and debt-capital ratio. By assuming that (𝛾1𝑢𝑖∗ + 𝛾2 𝜆) = 0, we are also assuming that changes in
the interest rate do not affect the values of the iso-inflation curves.
   That said, since −{[(𝛾1 − 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 )𝑢𝜆∗ + 𝛾2 (𝑖 + 𝜆𝜙1 )]⁄(1 + 𝛾1 − 𝛾2 𝜆𝜙2 )𝑢𝜎∗ } < 0, the iso-inflation
curve is downward slopping. Note that, other things equal, the more sensitive prices are to changes in the
wage share (debt-capital ratio), the more gradual (steeper) the iso-inflation curve. The second and fourth
quadrants only portray the relationship between interest rate and wage share and debt-capital ratio,
respectively, as observed in Figure 4.
   The first scenario in Figure 6 portrays the case where the Central Bank effectively reduces inflation by
raising the interest rate.

                                                 [FIGURE 6]

In this case, the Central Bank successfully manages to bring the inflation back to the target.
   Figure 7, on the other hand, presents the scenario where an increased interest rate actually reinforces
the inflationary trend in prices.

                                                 [FIGURE 7]

In this scenario, an expansionary monetary policy might be able to reduce inflation, as the debt-capital
ratio is more responsive to interest rate shocks than the wage share. That is, the negative impact of a
decrease in the benchmark interest rate on the debt-capital ratio outweighs the positive impact on the
wage share and hence reduces inflation. Contrastingly, the effect of an expansionary fiscal policy on
prices is ambiguous. As discussed in the end of the subsection 3.3, an increase in the government
expenditure relative to the capital stock reduces 𝜆. It follows from the inequality (45) that a decrease in 𝜆
increases the left-hand side of the inequality; however, the impact of a reduced 𝜆 on the right-hand side of
the inequality is ambiguous. Moreover, an increase in government spendings, 𝛼0 , would also affect the
values of the partials 𝑢𝜎∗ and 𝑢𝜆∗ , thereby making it more difficult to evaluate the impact of an
expansionary fiscal policy on changes in the long-term inflation rate.

4   Summary

This paper developed a formal model to account for the net impact of a raising interest rate on long-term
inflation. Here we identify two basic transmission channels through which monetary policy affects prices:
i) a raise in interest rates is more likely to decrease unit labour costs by reducing wages; ii) an interest rate
shock is more likely to expand overhead costs by increasing interest payments. The net impact of a
contractionary monetary policy on long-term inflation, then, depends on the relative responsiveness of
prices to changes in the wage share and interest payments. Thus, inflation is the result of distributive
conflict between workers, entrepreneurs and rentiers for a larger share of national income.
                                                       14
   By introducing the idea that interest rate shocks also affect the amount of credit granted to firms, we
demonstrate how changes in debt payments from firms to rentiers impact on firms’ overhead costs and
hence inflation. In a scenario where decision makers face fundamental uncertainty, firms and commercial
banks tend to form different expectations about the future, which usually leads to credit rationing since
banks tend to be more risk-averse than firms. Moreover, nothing guarantees a priori that the market-
clearing amount of loans set by borrowers and lenders yields a sustainable trajectory of capital
accumulation and inflation over time. In the case of a financially unstable system, we demonstrate that a
mix of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies can bring the economy back to a stable path of capital
accumulation and inflationary process.
   It is worth noting that this is a closed economy model. In an open economy, given that relative prices
do not change in the long run, the firms would hardly be able to pass on rising costs to prices indefinitely.
This would squeeze the profitability of domestic firms and undermine the accumulation of capital in the
long run. However, we leave the analysis of the open economy for future research.
   In short, we can say that our model raises a critique with respect of the ability of central banks to
effectively achieve the inflation target in the long run. In the New Consensus Macroeconomics there is a
clear-cut difference between the short and the long run. The NAIRU, according to this paradigm, is a
long-run equilibrium rate of unemployment which depends exclusively on structural factors and hence is
not subjected to short-run fluctuations. However, as demonstrated here, the equilibrium employment rate,
which is a function of the capacity utilisation, depends on the dynamics of indebtedness of firms over
time. Prices are also affected by multiple factors, such as the labour cost, the level of mark-up set by
firms, and market interest rates. Therefore, our model suggests that the inflation target set by the central
bank may not be constant since the equilibrium employment rate, wages, firms’ mark-up and market
interest rates (liquidity and risk premium) also vary over time.
