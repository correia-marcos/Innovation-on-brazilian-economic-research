Abstract
We analysed the effect of income on repeat criminal victimization in Brazil using data from the 2009
National Household Sample Survey and its special supplement on public safety. Two count-data
models were estimated for four types of crime: theft, robbery, attempted theft/robbery, and assault.
We found a nonlinear positive effect of income on repeat victimization for the three types of property
crimes, and a nonlinear negative effect of income on assault.

1. Introduction
    In the criminal universe, phenomena rarely follow a normal distribution. It is rather a universe
governed by “concentrations.” A small part of the territory tends to accumulate a large proportion
of crime (hot spots). A small number of criminals tend to commit a disproportionate amount of
crime (predators). Victimization also follows this trend, as a small group of victims is usually the
preferred target of a disproportionate amount of offenses.
    Situational criminology suggests that these concentrations are explained by a combination of
excessive risk factors and the absence of protective factors. An unmonitored area with intense
circulation of people and goods, low visibility, and signs of disorder becomes more attractive for the
commission of crimes. Low-weight infants, living in homes with unmarried teenage mothers, raised
by lone parents, or who leave school early are more likely to become criminals. Unmarried young
people, who often tend to leave their home unguarded, consume alcohol, and be careless with their
fancy phones are preferred prey for criminals.
    From the standpoint of public crime prevention policies, these concentrations are advantageous,
as they make it possible for resources to be allocated to areas and populations at risk through fo-
cused interventions, reducing risk factors and increasing protective factors. Identified hot spots can

programs – designed for people already involved with the criminal justice system – can focus on
strengthening educational and therapeutic treatments for young offenders. Police departments can
develop courses, booklets and guidelines for preventive measures to be adopted by owners of estab-
lishments that are attacked often. The problem is that it is difficult, or even impossible, to change
many risk factors. You can improve the surveillance of an area, but a central shopping promenade
might be always used for the same purposes and activities, implying risk. You can improve the
employability of young offenders, but you cannot modify their age, gender, IQ, or their involvement
in crime in the past. Victims can change risk behaviors and install security equipment, but there are
intrinsic characteristics of location, lifestyle, and architectural design, among others, which cannot be
modified. That is why increasing protective factors can shift some crimes to other areas or victims,
but some of them will inevitably remain concentrated in the same locations and targets.
    Many previous studies analyzed why some locations are more attractive to criminals than others
and why other ones concentrate certain types of crimes, while other studies investigated risk factors
associated with criminal trajectories of repeat offenders. Very little has been written, however, about
the phenomenon of repeat victimization (more than one of the same type of crime). Which variables
could help us understand why, despite being a relatively rare phenomenon, victimization mainly
affects a small percentage of victims?
    Repeat victimization has some known characteristics. Most people are not victimized at all, but
those who are present a high risk of being victimized again. Thus, prior victimization is one of the
best indicators of future victimization. Moreover, recurrence can be rapid. In repeat victimization,
the same type of criminal incident is experienced by the same victim or target within a specific
period of time, as within a year, for example. Thus, repeat victimization refers to the total amount
of offenses experienced by a victim or target, including initial and subsequent offenses.
    Previous evidence of the causes of repeat victimization in Brazil was uniquely found by Carvalho
and Lavor (2008) using data from a national survey carried out in 1988. The focus of their study
was particularly on the effect of income inequality on property crime (composed of theft and rob-
bery). Our study seeks empirical advances in the modelling of causes of repeat victimization. In
particular, the main objetive of this paper is that of analyzing the effect of income on repeat criminal
victimization by types of crime from an economic perspective.
    Victimization is a complex process and, consequently, one that is difficult to be modeled empir-
ically. There is a no single well-structured theory to guide empirical analyses in this field. Studies
have usually been based on two approaches that consider victims as objects of study, highlighting
the importance of their “lifestyle” and creation of “opportunities” for criminals to carry out their
crimes. Empirical analyses have been mainly based on the theoretical framework proposed by Co-
hen et al. (1981). Using data from some previous studies, these authors expanded and formalized
a sociological theory (which they refer to as the “opportunity model of predatory victimization”)
to explain victimization risk. According to this approach, there are five factors strongly related to
risk: exposure, proximity, guardianship, target attractiveness, and definitional proprieties of specific
crimes.
    Some factors with a bearing on repeat victimization can have a different effect according to the
type of crime in question, especially if the nature of the crime is considered, i.e. property crimes or
crimes against a person. Income, in particular, is widely debated in the literature. We are accustomed
to associating crime with poverty, which is true in connection with homicides and other violent crimes
against a person. Thus, a negative relationship between income and victimization is plausible. In the
case of property crimes, however, its effect is ambiguous. On the one hand, higher income reduces
the propensity to engage in crime, but on the other it produces more attractive targets, as property
crimes are primarily crimes of opportunity. The higher the income, the more goods a victim has,
the greater the criminal opportunities. But this relationship is not necessarily linear: low-income
individuals or places are less attractive, but after a certain threshold a higher income tends to increase
                                                    2
defences against crime through strategies and equipment designed to “block opportunities,” such as
video cameras, alarms, and security devices. In short, wealthier individuals are on the one hand
more economically attractive to criminals, but on the other they have stronger reasons and more
money to spend on their own security, especially after their first victimization. Therefore, the effect
of income on repeat victimization is ambiguous, but its net effect can be observed empirically.
    We believe that the sociological approach cited above is also helpful as a framework to understand
the process of repeat victimization, i.e. why some people are victims of the same type of crime twice
or more times. Our analisys is also based on a simple victimization model proposed by Gaviria and
Pagés (2002), where an individual’s wealth is the focus. In particular, the hypotheses tested here
are: 1) income causes a positive, albeit nonlinear, effect on repeat victimization; 2) income causes a
nonlinear negative effect on repeat victimization. This paper intends to test these hypotheses using
the most recent victimization data from a nationwide sample survey carried out in Brazil. Estimations
for four types of crimes (theft, robbery, attempted theft/robbery, assault)4 were performed separately.
The design of complex surveys was taken into account, since ignoring the sample design tends to
underestimate the actual variance. In summary, these are the main improvements made here in
relation to the previous empirical study.
    This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a brief description of a useful theoretical
framework for discussing the effect of income on repeat victimization; Section 3 provides details
about the empirical modelling; results are discussed in Section 4; and Section 5 concludes the study.

2. A Simple Victimization Model
    Gaviria and Pagés (2002) proposed a simple victimization model that, together with the approach
proposed by Cohen et al. (1981), is very useful for the empirical modelling that we’ll do in the next
section and for understanding the results presented in Section 4.
    Justus and Kassouf (2013) summarized the model’s framework. There are two actors (citizens
and criminals) and two stages. In the first stage, citizens (who are only different from one another
according to their wealth level) decide how much they will spend on private protection. In the second
stage, citizens are matched with criminals who in turn decide whether or not to commit a crime upon
observing the wealth (w) of their prospective victims and their investiments on private protection
(e). Assuming that criminals make their decisions on the mere basis of pecuniary factors, we can say
that they weigh two factors: if they are successful in committing the crime, they will be rewarded
with a portion of the victim’s wealth, given by α times w (α ≤ 1); and if they fail – the probability of
which is p – they pay a penalty equivalent to F . According to Justus and Kassouf (2013) the authors
haven’t point this out, but one must consider that failure means that the criminal was accused,
arrested, convicted, and punished as provided for in the law.
    Three additional assumptions are made: the probability of being caught is assumed to increase
monotonically with spending on private protection (i.e. p = p(e), where p0 > 0); victims and
criminals are considered as risk-neutral; criminals are assumed to have complete information in that
they observe their victim’s wealth and are able to correctly infer their risks of being caught.
    In this context, a criminal will attempt to victimize citizen i who possesses a wealth of wi and
spent ei on private protection as long as the following inequality holds

                                            (1 − p[ei ])αwi − p[ei ]F > 0                                           (1)
    Since all citizens are potential victims for criminals, a given citizen i can avoid becoming a victim
if he or she spends at least hi on private protection, where hi indicates the spending on protection
that would make a criminal indifferent between attempting to steal from i because the risk involved
would be too high. In sum,

      Assault is an aggraveted physical agression against a person and the three other types are property crimes.

                                         hi = p                                                     (2)

where p(−1) is the inverse of function p that links private spending on protection to the probability
of a criminal being punished.
    Equation(2) gives, for each wealth level, the minimal spending on private protection required to
prevent crime by deterring criminals. Therefore, citizens must decide whether they will spend hi on
their own protection or will not invest on its at all. They will spend hi only if it does not exceed the
prospective losses of being victimized. That is, if

    Wealthier persons would need, ceteris paribus, greater spending on private protection to avoid
victimization. This is the conclusion reached based on the first derivative of Eq.(2) with respect to
w,

    But are wealthier persons willing to spend more on protection to avoid being victimized? Or
will they instead prefer to bear some risk? The answer depends on the second derivative of h with
respect to w,

                                   = −                                                              (5)
                             dwi2               (F + αwi )4 p0 [hi ]3
    Equation (5) will be negative, unless the second derivative of p is both negative and large in
absolute value. So the wealthy will routinely invest in private security to avoid being victimized
unless p exhibits sharp diminishing returns to scale.
    If the marginal returns of an extra amount spent on private protection against crime are very
low, the wealthy will find it too expensive to reach the necessary level of protection to avoid being
victimized and will rationally decide to bear some measure of risk. Otherwise, they will spend the
portion of their wealth deemed necessary to avoid being victimized.
    In summary, according to the approach adopted by Gaviria and Pagés (2002), the wealth of
individuals determines both their economic attractiveness as victims and their capacity to protect
themselves from criminals by paying for their protection.
    Justus and Kassouf (2013) argue that according to the findings of Becker (1968), Ehrlich (1973),
Cohen et al. (1981) and Gaviria and Pagés (2002) it is to be expected that, given the opportunity cost
of crime, the likelihood of failure determined by government spending on public safety, the penalties
provided for in the law, and the costs involved in planning and committing a crime, criminals will pick
their victims based on their evaluation of those who are more economically attractive for the criminal
act. In this subjective evaluation, criminals take into account both the wealth of potential victims
and the likelihood of failure determined by how much they spend on their own protection. By doing
this, criminals optimize the expected return on crime. Therefore, the behavior of potential victims
has a direct bearing on the optimization process that is implicit in the rational choice of a criminal.
Thus, if the principle of economic rationality on the part of criminals holds, the risk of victimization
increases with wealth. However, as pointed out by Gaviria and Pagés (2002), wealthier individuals
have stronger reasons and more money to spend on their own security to protect themselves from
criminals. On the other hand, poorer individuals lack the financial means to pay for their protection
to avoid being victimized, but are less economically attractive potential victims to criminals than
wealthier individuals.

3. Empirical Modelling
    The first difficulty in investigating the causes of crime is that reliable information is hard to
come by (or virtually non-existent). Existing official data, especially that available in police records,
consists only in underestimated figures for actually committed crimes. The number of criminal
occurrences is underestimated because many of them are not actually registered in a formal police
report. A police report involves assessments and decisions of various individuals involved in an event
seen as a “police matter.”
    Actually, as suggested by victimization surveys conducted in several countries, there is clear
evidence that the actual crime rate is significantly higher than that reported based on official data.
A victimization survey is based on a random sample of a given population, which is asked about
instances of certain types of crimes in a given period of time. Besides allowing for better measurement
of the actual crime rate, among other advantages, these surveys make it possible for one to know
the characteristics of the victims and provide important inputs for empirical studies on the causes of
criminal victimization.
    In this study, we used cross-sectional data from Special Supplements on Food Security, Vic-
timization and Justice included in the National Household Sample Survey of 2009 (2009 PNAD in
Brazilian acronym) carried out by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE in
Brazilian acronym). Our empirical models were estimated taking into account the design of com-
plex surveys, since ignoring such sample design tends to lead to an underestimation of the actual
variance.5
    It must be said that our data set offers at least three advantages as compared to official crime
figures: 1) its coverage is nation-wide; 2) the response variable (i.e., crime) is free from bias caused
by measurement errors resulting from under-reporting, and 3) it allows for the effects of household
income, education, and other factors on the number of crimes to be identified based on non-victimized
individuals.
    The response variable of the empirical models is a count-data: the amount of times an individual
was victimized during one year. Models for four types of crimes were performed separately: robbery,
theft, attempted theft/robbery, and assault. Table 1 shows the distribution of victimization count-
data by type of crime.

   The next step is also very difficult, as it is not trivial to specify a model without a well-structured
crime causation theory. Fortunately, we can use the work of Cohen et al. (1981) and Gaviria and
Pagés (2002) as a starting point.
   We emphasize that for each explanatory variable selected there are several approaches that try
and explain why and how risk of victimization are affected. For instance, men are more victimized
because they tend to adopt risky behaviors due to the cultural roles assigned to them or to their
higher testosterone levels. Whites and nonwhites tend to live in different areas of cities with different

      For details see Skinner et al. (1998).

levels of crime. Young people have a more active lifestyle that exposes them to greater risks, and
married people tend to spend more time in their homes. Denser urban areas facilitate anonymity and
make crime less detectable. People who study or work spend more time on the street, increasing their
chances of victimization, and higher-income individuals carry more attractive goods than others.
    In this study, income is the predictor of our greatest interest. Thus, we take into account the
logarithm for monthly household income – lln(inc) – and also the number of individuals within
a family (famsize) for property crimes (theft, robbery, attempted theft/robbery). For assault vic-
timization, we decided to use the logarithm for monthly per capita household income – ln(incp).
Regarding types of crime, another difference is that for property crimes hours of work outside one’s
home in a week are used, while for assault only a dummy variable is used that assumes 1 if the
individual is employed and 0 if otherwise (works).
    Besides the 27 dummy variables used to take into account possible regional differences among
Brazilian states, the other dependent variables that are common to the four models are: age in years
(age) and the square of this variable (agesq); a dummy variable to distinguish gender, which assumes
value 1 for males and 0 for females (man); a dummy variable to distinguish color or race (white),
which assumes value 1 for white or Asian people and 0 for black, mulatto or indigenous people; a
dummy variable for location of residence, which is 1 for urban areas and 0 otherwise (urban); a
dummy for type of residence, which is 1 for house and 0 for apartament (house); a dummy variable
for marital status, which is 1 for married and 0 for single (married); a dummy variable for student
status, which is 1 for students and 0 otherwise (student); years of schooling (school); a dummy
variable which is 1 if the person owns a car or motorcycle and 0 otherwise (ownvehi). Table A.1
describes all these variables precisely.
    Because the dependent variable is discrete, its distribuition places probability mass at nonnegative
integer values only. Fully parametric formulations of count models accommodate this property
distribution. Cameron and Trivedi (2009) and Kleiber and Zeileis (2008) are convenient references
for the methodological background for count-data model. A mix of both references was used in the
next paragraphs.
    The modeling exercise began with the standard linear regression model, which is estimated by
OLS,

                                      yi = x0i β + εi ,   i = 1, ..., n,                               (6)
where yi is the number of times an individual i was victimized in one year, xi is the column vector
of covariates for observation i, which is described later, β is a k × 1 vector of regression coefficients
and εi is the error term.
    There are three aspects in the linear regression model for a conditionally normally distributed
response y: 1) linear predictor ηi = x0i β, through whichµi = E(yi |xi ) depends on the k × 1 vectors xi
of observations and β of parameters; 2) the distribution of the dependent variable yi |xi is N (µi , σ 2 );
and 3) the expected response is equal to linear predictor, µi = ηi .
    The class of generalized linear models (GLMs) extends 1) and 3) to more general families of
distributions for y and to more general relations between E(yi |xi ) and the linear predictor than the
identity. Specifically, (yi |xi ) may now follow a density or probability mass function of the type

where θ, referred to as the canonical parameter, depends on the linear predictor, and the additional
parameter φ, referred to as the dispersion parameter, is often known. In addition, the linear predictor
and the expectation of y are now related by a monotonic transformation (referred to as the link
function of the GLM),

    For fixed θ, (7) describes a linear exponential family. Then, the distribution of the dependent
variable yi |xi is a linear exponential family, a class that includes the Poisson and binomial distribution.
    Thus, in addition to other possibilities, the family of GLMs extends the applicability of linear-
model ideas to data where responses are binary or counts.
    We start with a standard model for count data, which is a Poisson regression. As observed above,
it is a generalized linear model. Using the canonical link for the Poisson family (the log link), the
model is

                                          E(yi |xi ) = µi = exp(x0i β)                                  (8)
    In a Poisson distribution, the variance equals the mean (equidispersion). It is necessary to check
this built-in feature. Poisson regressions are often plagued by overdispersion, which means that the
variance is greater than the linear predictor permits.
    Overdispersion can be tested for by considering the alternative hypothesis

                                         Var(yi |xi ) = µi + α · h(µi ),                                (9)
    where h is a positive function of µi . Overdispersion corresponds to α > 0 and underdispersion to
α < 0.
    A common specification of the transformation function h is h(µ) = µ2 was used. Therefore,
the formal test of the null hypothesis of equidispersion, Var(yi |xi ) = E(yi |xi ) for all i, against the
alternative of overdispersion, is based on the equation

                                     Var(yi |xi ) = E(yi |xi ) + α2 E(yi |xi ).                        (10)
H0 : α = 0 was tested againstH1 : α > 0 implemented by an auxiliary OLS regression of the
generated dependent variable, {(yi − µ̂)2 − yi }/µ̂ on µ̂, without an intercept term, and performing
a t test for whether the coefficient of µ̂ is zero, which is asymptotically standard normal under the
null hypothesis.
    The t statistics are 11.98 for theft, 8.72 for robbery, 10.29 for attempted theft/robbery, and 14.37
for assault, with one-sided p-value of 0.000 for all models. The results suggest that the Poisson
model for the victimization data is not well specified, as there appears to be a substantial amount
of overdispersion.
    A possible solution is to consider a more flexible distribution that does not impose equality of
mean and variance. The most widely used distribution in this context is the negative binomial. It
may be considered a mixture distribution arising from a Poisson distribution with random scale, the
latter following a gamma distribution. Its probability mass function is

                                   Γ (θ + y)      µy θ θ
                   f (y; θ, φ) =             +            ,      y = 1, 2, · · · , µ > 0, θ > 0.       (11)
                                    Γ(θ)y!)    (µ + θ)y+θ
   It must be said that the variance of the negative binomial distribution is given by
                                                           1
                                       Var(y; θ, φ) = µ + µ2 ,                                     (12)
                                                           θ
which is of the form (3) with h(µ) = µ2 and α = 1/θ.
    For estimating negative binomial model (NB) with known θ, the shape parameter of the fitted
negative binomial distribution for the four models (i.e., types of crimes),θ̂, suggested that there is a
considerable amount of overdispersion, corroborating with the results of the test for overdispersion.
    A problem often faced with count data regressions is that the number of zeros is often much
larger than a Poisson or negative binomial regression permits. In fact, Table 1 indicates that our
data contains a large number of zeros. For instance, at least 94.7% of all people were not victimized.
Thus, models for zero-inflated data are better.
                                                   7
    The zero-inflated model was originally proposed to handle excess zeros relative to the Poisson
model. It supplements a count density,f2 (·), with a binary process with a density of f1 (·). If the
binary process takes on a value of 0 with a probability of f1 (0), then y = 0. If the binary process
takes on a value of 1 with a probability of f1 (1), then y takes on the count values 0, 1, 2, · · · from
the count density f2 (·). This lets zero counts occur as a realization of the binary process and as a
realization of the count process when the binary randon variable takes on a value of 1.
    Suppressing regressors for simplicity, the zero-inflated model has a density of
                                    (
                                      f1 (0) + {1 − f1 (0)}f2 (0) if y = 0
                            f (y) =                                                                  (13)
                                      {1 − f1 (0)}f2 (0)          if y ≥ 0
    In this study, the f1 (0) was parameterized through a Probit model and a negative binomial
distribution for the count component was used. The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model
is a mixture specification with a negative binomial count component and an additional point mass
at zero.
    We estimated a regression of victimization on all further variables for the count part and modelled
the inflation component as a function of man and white. Apart from these variables, the previous
study performed by Carvalho and Lavor (2008) takes into account a dummy variable for owning a
TV set. Here, this control was not used because today almost all people have a TV set at their
home. Moreover, the dummy variables for the Brazilian states were used as variables in the inflation
component.
    The LR test of Vuong to discriminate between the NB and ZINB models (see Cameron and
Trivedi, 2009, 586-590) was applied. The test statistic is standard normally distributed, with large
positive values favoring the ZINB model and large negative values favoring the NB model. In this
study, the test statistic is a large positive value for the four models (i.e. types of crime) with a
one-sided very small p-value. So only the results of ZINB models will be discussed next.

4. Results
    Our model includes several variables that correlate significantly with repeat victimization. Sev-
eral criminological theories – inspired by situational criminology theories related to lifestyles, rational
choice, psycho-biology, etc. – try to explain how prople act to increase or decrease repeat victim-
ization. The direction of this relationship, however, is often ambiguous, according to the theoretical
perspective one adopts. Moreover, the meaning may be different, depending on whether we are
talking about property or personal victimization. Thus, we cannot determine unequivocally which
theories are correct or incorrect and we must rely only on observed empirical evidence.
    In this context, before discussing our results, it is interesting to summarize some postulates of the
literature regarding theoretical relationships between victimization and the main variables included
in the empirical model.
    First, men adopt more risky behaviors (drinking, carring a gun) and have a culture of violent
conflict resolution in the case of assault that increase the rate of repeat victimization. On the other
hand, adult males are less subject to domestic violence, given the greater physical vulnerability of
women. The higher income of white or Asian people in Brazil makes them more attractive targets
for criminals. Therefore, the distribution of racial groups in space is not random: white and Asian
people usually live in areas that are more exposed to property crimes, but less exposed to crimes
against persons (assault). On the other hand, ethnic groups with a higher income and that invest in
self-protection are less exposed to the risk of repeat victimization.
    Second, young people spend more time on the street and take more risky behaviors in terms
of drinking, carrying a gun, etc. Higher testosterone can also increase the risk of victimization
by assault, as well as hasty reactions. Young people rely less on police, increasing the chances of
impunity for perpetrators of crimes. On the other hand, they tend to travel in groups, reducing their
                                                     8
exposure to risk. The physical vulnerability of elderly people can, in turn, expose them to greater
risk of victimization.
    Third, married people spend more time at home, implying less risky behaviors and more intense
surveillance of their homes and other property. Regarding family size, larger families are associated
with lower incomes, reducing their attractiveness, but large families increase the surveillance of their
property. On the other hand, high density (many residents in the same space) can enhance the risk
of domestic conflicts.
    Fourth, individuals living in urban areas are more anonymous, have a greater supply of goods
and are less exposed to the possibility or victims running into offenders more than once, reducing
the risk of detection of crime and punishment.
    Fifth, common houses are particularly vulnerable to theft and residential burglary because of their
architecture. On the other hand, this perceived vulnerability can encourage their owners to protect or
guard them more intensely. Victimized owners increase the level of post-incident protection, reducing
their exposure to repeat victimization.
    Sixth, with regard to education, students spend more time on the streets (in recreational and
social activities) and adopt more risky behaviors. However, travelling in groups and alternative
forms of conflict resolution can reduce the risk of victimization by assault. Schooling is associated
with a higher income, a fact that makes more schooled individuals more attractive as targets. Also
in this case, alternative forms of conflict resolution and improvements in the social environment
can reduce the rate of victimization by assault. Individuals who work are more exposed to risks
because their homes remain more unprotected when they are out working and their income might be
higher, enhancing their attractiveness to criminals. On the other hand, unemployment can increase
the risk of assaults if associated with alcohol abuse, spending long hours on the streets, partying,
low self-esteem, conflicts in the family. In sum, workers are more exposed to risks as they spend
more time on the streets, their homes remain unprotected, their income increases and, as a result,
their attractiveness as targets to criminals increases. More working hours also increase the risk of
victimization.
    Finally, higher-income individuals are more attractive to criminals. The distribution of income
groups in space is not random: the affluent live in areas that are more exposed to property crimes
but less exposed to crimes against people. On the other hand, higher income people invest more in
self-protection. Owning a vehicle is another proxy variable for economic attractiveness, especially for
vehicle theft/robbery. Conversely, it reduces the use of public transportation, which can be a factor
of protection.
    As noted, for almost all variables there are good theoretical reasons to expect both positive and
negative effects on victimization. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is that of investigating
the net effect of these variables on repeat victimization, which we believe is not different from simple
victimization (i.e. a single victimization).
    Next, we describe and briefly discuss the main results found. However, before showing the results
for repeat victimization models, we analyze how the same variables affect simple victimization. Table
A.2 shows the results of the simple victimization model, in which the same regressors were used.
    The simple victimizations model suggests that some variables increase the likelihood of victim-
ization: being male, older, living in urban areas, studying, working many hours a week and having
higher incomes. In contrast, the sign is negative (i.e. it decreases the likelihood of victimization) for
factors such as being white or Asian (for consummated theft only), being married, living in a house,
and having a large family.
    Regarding assault (crime against a person), it is interesting to note that most variables maintain
their significance and sign, but in some cases the sign appears inverted: studying and years of
schooling increase the likelihood of property victimization, but for assault the effect is opposite, i.e.
it protects potential victims. This demonstrates the need to distinguish the different types of crimes
in the analysis, as sugested in Cohen et al. (1981).
                                                   9
    At this point, one must remember that the two hypotheses stated in the introduction of this
paper were: first, that income has a nonlinear positive effect on repeat victimization; and second,
that income has a nonlinear negative effect on repeat victimization. Table Table 2 shows the results
of the repeat victimization model.
    Our results indicate that, on the one hand, income has a nonlinear positive effect on the amount
of times an individual was victimized by property crimes in a one-year period. On the other hand,
evidence is provided of a nonlinear negative effect on assault. So the hypotheses tested here are
not rejected. This evidence reinforces the economic approach, namely, that income determines vic-
timization based on two factors: economic attractiveness and investment in self-protection. This
approach was presented in Section 2. The results also corroborate the sociological thesis according
to which wealthier people are less exposed to the risk of suffering aggravated physical aggression such
as assault, for instance. One can understand that the results found for the model of victimization by
assault can be used as counter-evidence of the robustness of the results found for the three property
crimes analyzed in this study. We believe so, particularly because in the case of assault the effect of
income was negative, while for other crimes (against property) it was positive.
    Regarding other results, the first important point to make is that the variables and sign found for
simple victimization remains virtually unchanged when we analyze the repeat victimization model.
This piece of evidence reinforces our suspicion that the net effect of the main variables on repeat
victimization is the same when compared to simple victimization. Moreover, it corroborates the ideia
that it is possible to use the traditional sociological approach proposed by Cohen et al. (1981) to
analyze repeat victimization as well. Similarly, the economic approach used in Gaviria and Pagés
(2002) is also useful for this purpose. This is an important issue that was clarified in this study.
    Regarding the repeat victimization model, it was seen that crimes increase in average if a person
is male, older, lives in an urban area, studies or works, is highly educated, works for many hours
a week and has a higher income. On the other hand, a person is more protected against repeat
victimization if he or she is white or Asian (for consummated theft only), married, lives in a house
or has a large family. As in the case of simple victimization, the variables that control for being a
student and having more years of schooling increase the chances of repeat victimization, but the sign
is inverted in the case of repeat assault.
    Others variables also have a positive effect on repeat victimization, namely, being male, young,
living in an urban area, studying, having a high level of education, working for long hours, and having
a higher income. On the other hand, protective factors that reduce the chances of victimization
include being white/Asian (for theft only), being married, living in a house, owning a vehicle and
having a large family. We found that for some variables, such as being a student and years of
schooling, the effect shifts direction according to the kind of victimization as risk factors turn into
protective factors in the case of assault.

    Finally, it must be said that according to the 2009 PNAD survey, the feeling of insecurity in Brazil
increases significantly as the per capita household income rises. For example, in the metropolitan
area of São Paulo, 42.9% of all individuals with a per capita household income below one-quarter
of the minimum wage felt safe. This percentage decreases as the income level increases, to the
point of being up to 12.7 percentage points lower for two or more people earning minimum wages.
On the other hand, people tend to invest more in self-protection equipment to reduce the risk of
victimization when they are victimized more than once, i.e. when they suffer repeat victimization.
The questionnaire of the 2009 PNAD survey includes several questions about the use of safety devices
for self-protection in one’s home. But the response is binary, yes or no, so it is not possible to know
how much money the individuals are spending on self-protection. Moreover, this variable is clearly
endogenous. We cannot know, for example, if their investiments in self-protection were made before
or after their first victimization. For this reason, we chose not to use this variable as a regressor.
But, the role of self-protection in repeat victimization was at least partially controlled for when
household income was taken into account. However, an advance would consist in finding a set of
valid instruments for the use of self-protection means.

5. Concluding remarks
    The main objective of this paper was to estimate the effect of income on theft, robbery, attempted
theft/robbery, and assault. We found evidence supporting the hypotheses tested that income has a
nonlinear positive effect on the number of times an individual was victimized by property crimes,
but a nonlinear negative effect on assault – a crime against a person.
    When we compared the simple victimization model to the repeat victimization model, no major
differences in terms of signs of coefficients were found. In other words, the difference between the two
phenomena is not in nature, but in scale. Moreover, we found that it is very important to distinguish
the different types of crimes in the modeling.
    The results of this paper corroborate the main evidence found by Carvalho and Lavor (2008),
although the marginal effects were different because three crimes against property were analyzed
separately here.
    It must be said that some risk factors can be modified through public policy or individual actions,
but others simply cannot. Nobody can change one’s color, age or gender to prevent crime. No one
will leave school or a job, marry or purposely earn less just to reduce his or her exposure to risk. It
is also possible to move or change one’s type of residence, but individuals rarely make such decisions
for safety reasons alone.
    Finally, although we have a better understanding of risk factors associated with victimization and
repeat victimization, they will continue to manifest themselves. Those who accumulate “risk factors”
will continue to have a higher probability of being victimized than others. There are additional
reasons for repeat victimization: a first successful action on a target – mainly on fixed targets such
as homes or businesses – encourages criminals to repeat it. Also, if protection mechanisms are
damaged and not repaired, targets are exposed to the risk of new attacks. In any case, finding out
variables that increase or decrease the risk of exposure is not just an academic curiosity. When a
group finds out that it belong to a risk group it becomes more alert. Such target group is thus led
to review risk behaviors and take more precautions than others.
