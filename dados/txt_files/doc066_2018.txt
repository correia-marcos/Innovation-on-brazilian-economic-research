ABSTRACT: The aim of this research is to discuss the theory on productivity growth as well as its
empirical applications. It emphasized the impact of the real exchange rate devaluation on
productivity. The main research question is: does the real exchange rate have a positive or negative
impact on productivity growth? Besides define a productivity equation that considers the
relationship between productivity growth and real exchange rate an empirical experiment that
estimates the productivity growth equation for a sample of Latin American countries was
performed. Regarding to the real exchange rate and this variable taken in squared, the parameters
are negative for all countries, indicating that real exchange rate devaluation does not increase
productivity growth.

   1. Introduction

The aim of this research is to discuss the theory on productivity growth as well as its empirical
applications. It follows the work of Hein and Tarassow (2010). The research on demand regimes
and productivity growth has reserved limited space to the role played by the real exchange rate.
Missio and Jayme Jr. (2013), Bresser-Pereira (1991, 2006, 2010, 2012), Bresser-Pereira and Gala
(2010), Ferrari-Filho and Fonseca (2013) Bresser-Pereira, Oreiro and Marconi (2012, 2014),
amongst others emphasized the impact of the real exchange rate devaluation on productivity. This
discussion is particularly relevant for Latin American countries in which the real exchange rate has
been crucial to economic policy debates. The main question is: does the real exchange rate have a
positive or negative impact on productivity growth?

In order to answer this question, the first step is to define a productivity equation that considers the
relationship between productivity growth and real exchange rate. Then, the real exchange rate is
added to the equation proposed by Naastepad (2006) and Hein and Tarassow (2010). A second step
is to discuss productivity growth in the context of demand regimes. The third step consists in
carrying out an empirical experiment that estimates the productivity growth equation for a sample
of Latin American countries, namely, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
Uruguay and Venezuela. Together, these countries represent 86% of the GPD of the Latin America
(WDI, 2013).

Besides this short introduction, the research is divided as follows: In the second section the
productivity equation is defined. The third section is dedicated to discussing the formal model. The
fourth section includes a discussion on empirical studies on productivity growth. The fifth section is
dedicated to the empirical experiment. Finally, the last section brings final considerations.

   2. Productivity growth

According to Storm and Naastepad (2012), productivity growth is endogenous, depending on the
rate of growth of both demand and real wages. Considering that the demand regime can be wage-
led or profit-led, in both cases, an increase in real wages can affect productivity positively through
increasing spending on R&D, investment and capital intensity in production. Naastepad (2006),
Storm and Naastepad (2012), and Hein and Tarassow (2010) show empirical evidence for this
relationship to several European countries. The relationship between real wage growth and
productivity growth is well established for European countries. However, the literature regarding
this theme presents two important gaps. First, it lacks empirical studies for Latin American
countries, whose economies differ greatly from those of European countries. Secondly, the
literature largely ignores the interactions between the real exchange rate and productivity growth.
Hence, a detailed study addressing these issues is required.

The relationship between the real exchange rate and growth depends on the price setting
mechanisms. Hein and Tarassow (2010) argue that, if prices are set to follow the mark-up on unit
variable costs, which are imported material costs and labour costs, variations on profit share can be
induced by a change in the mark-up in the ratio of imported materials to unit labour costs. An
increase in profit share is created by a rising mark-up, domestic prices tend to increase and the real
exchange rate and hence international competitiveness will decline. Nevertheless, if an increase
profit share is originated by an increasing unit imported material costs ratio to unit labour costs, the
real exchange rate will also raise and international competitiveness will improve. The depreciation
of the domestic currency in nominal terms, which means, increasing in the nominal exchange rate,
or decreasing nominal wages will raise unit material costs ratio to unit labour costs, and will hence
increase profit share along with improved competitiveness. Although raising profit share can have a
positive or negative relation with competitiveness, it can be argued that the real exchange rate can
increase or decrease productivity growth. Therefore, this relationship must be taken into
consideration.

Since there is the possibility of wage-led or profit-led demand regime, it is interesting to consider
external constraints. Basilio and Oreiro (2015) argue that for developing economies, if the demand
regime is wage-led, economic growth in the short term might be slow, due to differences in income
elasticity of imports and exports. In a developing country, in general, the income elasticity of
imports is higher than the income elasticity of exports. Therefore, increasing wage shares raises
imports more than proportionally, thus generating an external constraint to economic growth, along
the lines of the Thirlwall’s law. The authors, however, do not consider the fact that the increasing
wage share can have positive impact on productivity growth. In any case, it is important the study
of external constrain when wage-led/profit-led approach is studied.

Formally, a simple equation of endogenous productivity growth can be expressed as follows:

                                                                                  (1)

Where is the growth rate of labour productivity, the growth rate of real output, the growth
rate of the real wage and the real exchange rate. Since the equation has been defined, the next step
is to discuss the equation arguments.

2.1 Verdoorn effect

The coefficient     is the Kaldor-Verdoorn coefficient. The relation between increasing productivity
and demand growth can be expressed through the following channels: i) improvements in the
division of labour; ii) learning-by-doing; iii) increasing investment, as new equipment and new
methods can both enhance productivity (Storm and Naastepad, 2012). One of the first papers to
formalize Kaldor’s view on growth was Dixon and Thirlwall (1975). The authors present a model to
explain differences on economic growth rate among different regions. The central argument is that a
region’s initial growth will be sustained dynamically through increasing returns to scale. In this
way, all other things being equal, increasing returns to scale will give rise to income divergence
among regions. There is vast empirical evidence on this relationship. Naastepad (2006), Storm and
Naastepad (2012), Hein and Tarassow (2010) bring strong econometric evidence on this approach.
This theory is especially important for development of countries economic growth, because this
approach has the potential to clarify the role of the modern sectors and aggregate demand on
productive growth. This theory is critical for economic policy, since managing aggregate demand is
one relevant economic policy tool.

Originally, the Verdoorn-Kaldor coefficient was expressed as:

                                                                                   (2)

where is the productivity growth,        is the autonomous component of productivity and is the
Verdoorn coefficient. Dixon and Thirlwall (1975) argue that the Verdoorn coefficient is the
parameter that exaggerates the effect differences among regions.

There are some issues related to the Verdoorn-Kaldor coefficient. McCombie et al. (2002) stress
two issues related to this approach. The first is related to problems in the productivity equation,
specifically the Verdoorn- Kaldor coefficient. The equation which relates the productivity growth
with income growth can be expressed as:

                                                                                   (3)
Following McCombie et al. (2002), the controversy is associated with the equation specification,
which can display bias caused by spurious correlation between productivity growth ( ) and income
growth ( . Since             , it is possible to overcome the bias using the specification in which
employment growth rate is the dependent variable and the income growth is the independent
variable. The problem arises by the fact that both (employment growth rate and income rate) are
endogenous. Other alternatives involve using capital stock, labour share and capital as independent
variable, however, have poor empirical evidence.

Empirically, one way to overcome the spurious correlation is to lag the independent variable, which
has the advantage of resolving complications connected with endogeneity. The econometric
exercises in the Kaleckian tradition involving productivity regimes, such as Naastepad (2006),
Storm and Naastepad (2012), Hein and Tarassow (2010), usually work with lags on the independent
variables to avoid simultaneity between the dependent and independent variables, e.g., the
dependent variable taking in the contemporaneous form cannot determinate the past values of the
independent variables, which are taken in the lag form. Thus, it is possible to use the income growth
variable to capture the Verdoorn-Kaldor effect. Of course, it is important to understand and
overcome such problems. An important guide to estimate the coefficient is to study the means the
literature solves the problem.

2.2 Productivity and real wage

The coefficient     in equation (1) reflects a positive relationship between real wages growth and
productivity growth. Supposing high employment rate, which possibly raises the workers bargain
power will quicken boost the nominal, and consequently the real wages. In such a case, it is
expected that the wage share will also increase in the total economy income, thus causing a
reduction in the profit share. Firms and capitalist, in turn, have incentives to enhance productivity
growth and avoid the profit squeeze. Therefore, increases in real wages can have a positive impact
on productivity growth (Hein and Tarassow, 2009, p. 735).

There are empirical evidences for this relationship. Naastepad (2006), and Hein and Tarassow
(2010) confirm this relationship for European countries. It is important to note that the economic
structure of Europeans countries is different from the Latin American countries. Because Latin
American countries are less industrialized when compared to Europeans countries, the workers will
have less bargain powers. Moreover, supposing that the workers have bargaining powers, it can be
the case that the firms will have difficulties to enhance productivity growth in face of real wage
growth. Hence, increasing real wage growth above productivity growth will reduce the firms’
profitability, and if the investment decisions depend on profits, firms will reduce investment and the
productivity growth will fall. Whether this relationship is positive or negative, it is a question for
empirical experiment, which will be undertaken further in this research.

Thus, increasing real wages lead to improvement in technical progress and innovation. Moreover,
an increase in real wages can also eliminate inefficient firms, favouring structural changes and
raising skilled workers proportion in the economy. In this research is argued that this positive effect
is only possible when enterprises can innovate in the face of increasing real wages. For
underdevelopment economies, real wage increases above the productivity labour level can squeeze
profits and hence reduce investments. Therefore, the relationship between real wages and
productivity growth can be reverse of that found elsewhere. It might be possible that the level of
economic development can interfere with the dynamics of productivity growth through time.

2.3 Productivity and real exchange rate

The coefficient     in equation (1) reflects the indirect impact of the real exchange rate on
productivity growth. Krugman and Taylor (1978) explain the reasons aggregate demand falls when
the exchange rate is undervalued. The devaluation leads to increasing export and import prices. If
the increase in import prices overcomes the variation in exports, the net result will be a reduction of
the country's income. Also, if the imports prices increase, imported machines and equipment
become more expensive, which will have a negative impact on productivity growth.

On the other hand, the      coefficient can be positive, and the main channel for this is described by
Missio and Jayme Jr. (2013). They argue that a higher real exchange rate level (devaluation)
increases the profit share and affects the planned spending decisions on business innovation, since it
changes the funds availability necessary to finance investment and innovative activity (Missio and
Jayme Jr, 2013). In this case, a devaluation of the real exchange rate increases profits, which
increases investment, and thus aggregate demand. Implicitly, the authors are considering that the
aggregate demand regime is profit-led.

   3. The model

Hein and Tarassow (2010) introduce the discussion of technical change and productivity on
aggregate demand. “Productivity will be profit-led if an increase in wages discourages productivity-
enhancing capital investment and, as a consequence, the growth of labour productivity slows down
(as most forms of technological progress require capital investment, this is called embodied
technological progress). Increases in wage growth may have a positive effect on productivity
growth, if either firm react by increasing productivity-enhancing investments in order to maintain
competitiveness or if workers’ contribution to the production process improves. This may be the
case either because of enhanced workers’ motivation or, in developing countries, if their health and
nutritional situation improves. This case is often referred to as the efficiency wage hypothesis in the
mainstream literature. (Lavoie; Stockhammer, p. 15, 2012)”. It is assumed that the output (Y) is
homogeneous. The capital-potential output ratio is (              ), where is assumed as the capital
potential output. The parameter “ ” is capacity utilization rate given by the capital stock. The
labour-output ratio is (         ), both “ ” and “ ” are assumed to be constant. The (                is
real wage, ( rate of profit and ( ) capacity utilization rate.

Following the Kaleckian tradition, the model is built upon the following equation:

                                                                                      (4)

where    is the profit share.

The income distribution between profit and wage share is determined by the mark-up. As usual, if
the material costs are excluded, firms apply a mark-up on labour cost per unit of output (W/Y) that
is assumed to be constant. Hence, the pricing equation is:

                                                                                      (5)

where is the mark-up. For a particular production technology the real wage rate can be written as
follows:

                                                                                      (6)

Therefore, the profit share can be defined as follows:

                                                                                      (7)

The saving equation can be written in the following form:
                                                                                                  (8)

in which            is the propensity to save out of wages. Employing the classical model assumption
                         . Considering an open economy, the goods market equilibrium is defined as
follows:

                                                                                                 (9)

where is total savings,       the total nominal investment,    the total nominal export,    the
total nominal imports and        the net exports. Dividing the above equation by nominal capital
stock ( ), it is obtained: i)           ; ii)        and iii)             .

                                                                                                (10)

Assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds1, which states that the absolute values of exports and
imports elasticities summed up exceed unity. The net export depends on: i) real exchange rate ( );
ii) domestic capacity utilization ( ) indicating domestic demand; and iii) foreign capacity utilization
( ) as an indicator for foreign demand. The net export equation can be expressed as follows:

                                                                                                (11)

The stability condition is                                                                      . In this sense, the
elasticity of saving is bigger the elasticity of investment and net export.

In this model, the capital accumulation equation considered the growth rate of productivity. The
capital accumulation is positivity related to profit share, to capacity utilization and to productivity
growth ( ). The accumulation rate is positive whenever expected profit rate exceeds a minimum
profit rate (   ).

                                                            to                                  (12)

Assuming that the stability condition holds, and plugging equations (8), (12) and (11) into equation
(10), and solving for capacity utilization and capital accumulation, the following equations are
achieved:

                                                                                                (13)


                                                                                                (14)

Take the derivative of the above equations in relation to profit share:

                                                                                                (15)

  Unfortunately, the variable real wage of the total worker’s compensation was not found. Actually, it was found the
Unemployment, total (% of total labour force) (national estimate). In order to obtain the employment rate, it was made
the following account for each period: 100-Unemployment.
                                                                                    (16)

From the equation (15), a positive result of this equation means that the positive effect related with
investment demand ( ) and with net exports (          ) is bigger than the reduction in consumption
(            ). In this case a profit-led demand is reached. Otherwise, a wage-led demand is
achieved.

Taking the partial derivative of capital accumulation in relation to saving out profits and wages it is
obtained          ,         . Increasing propensity to save out wages and profits reduces capital
accumulation. The partial derivative of capital accumulation in an open economy makes it less
likely for the economy’s accumulation and growth to be a wage-led growth regime. The overall
outcome for equation (16) depends on the direct effect of the improvement in the profit (
           1    + 2}), the indirect effect of distribution (         ), and finally the indirect
effect of international competitiveness through net export and domestic capacity utilization
(       ).


Taking the partial derivative of the profit rate equation in relation to the endogenous variables, the
overall outcome for profit rate is the same as in a closed economy and the analysis applied for the
profit share can be easily reproduced.

The partial derivatives show the positive effect on capacity utilization and capital accumulation by
the investment and net exports. However, we have a negative effect in relation to consumption. The
analysis of demand regime depends on the magnitude of the effects of each of components
(elasticity investment and profit share on consumption) compared to the accumulation of capital and
capacity utilization.

Productivity is positively related to capacity utilization and capital accumulation, and negatively
related to the profit share. Increase in capacity utilization requires companies to increase efforts to
raise productivity in order to reduce the impact of the higher wage share. As discussed before, the
productivity equations can be defined as follows:

                                                                                    (17)

or

                                                                                    (18)

Assuming that equations (17) and (18) hold at the same time               , thus it is possible to work
with either of these two equations. It is also important to notice that the profit share is negatively
related with productivity growth.

Merging equation (13) and (17), it is achieved the long-run equilibrium rates for capacity utilization
and productivity growth as follows:

                                                                                    (19)


                                                                                    (20)
Substituting equation (19) and (20) into (12), it is obtained the long-run capital accumulation rate,
as follows:




                                                                                   (21)

The stability condition requires that the slope of capacity utilization and capital accumulation
equations be bigger than the slope of productivity equation. It is possible to make this condition
explicit as follows:

                                                                                    (22)

                                                                                    (23)

In the case in which those conditions are violated, the growth path of capacity utilization becomes
explosive.

Taking the partial derivative of the long-run capacity utilization rate equation (19) in relation to
profit share, it is achieved the following expression:

                                                                                    (24)

The result is quite close to the result for an open economy model. If the overall result of equation
(24) is positive, which means that the positive effect related with investment demand ( ) and with
net exports (     ), plus the effect of the real exchange rate on productivity ( ) is bigger than the
reduction in consumption (                ) and      , the last term related if productivity growth
equation. In this case the demand is profit-led. Otherwise, it is wage-led.

Taking the partial derivative of capital accumulation rate in the long-run equilibrium (21) in relation
to the profit share, it is obtained the follow equation:

                                                                                    (25)

From the expression (25), wage-led accumulation and growth regime are less likely. However, in
this model, which includes productivity growth, the result is less profit-led growth, if the profit
share is negatively related to productivity growth.

The outcome for equation (25) depends on the direct effect of the improving in profits (
   2 +             1 + 2), which in this case the parameters related to productivity ( 2) can
decrease this whole term. The indirect effect of distribution (                 ), which in this
model, the productivity term can make this term even bigger, when compared with the model
related to open economy.
Finally, the indirect effect of international competitiveness, net export and domestic capacity
utilization (                     ), it is obtained in this model a positive feedback effect through
international competitiveness on productivity ( ). Assuming that the Marshall-Lerner condition
holds, devaluation in the real exchange rate would increase competitiveness, increasing the set of
parameters [               +     )], which would make the profit-led accumulation more likely. As it
was discussed for the model with open economy, if the income redistribution favours wages, and
this is associated with a decrease in the mark-up pricing, competitiveness will improve, thus raising
the net exports, which might reinforce a wage-led demand.

Finally, it is possible to analyse the relation between productivity growth and profit share in the
short term as follows:

                                                                                    (26)

Changes on profit share have two effects on productivity growth rate in the long-run equilibrium.
The first effect is through the goods market expressed by the term (
  3      ). This term might be positive or negative. It depends on the demand regime, which can be
profit-led or wage-led. The second effect is through the term (
    ), which is, by assumption, positive. This term is related with the negative effect of profit share
on productivity ( ). The overall result can be positive or negative; it will depend on the
relationship of increase profit share on productivity growth.

The demand regime can be profit-led or wage-led, as it has been discussed in this work, and it
depends on the overall outcomes of equations (24), (25), and (26). In the case of              ,
which means a wage-led demand regime, if the profit share increases, the impact on productivity
growth (     ) is negative. Under a profit-led demand regime (                   ), increase on profit
share will have a positive impact on      and     , whereas it can have a positive or negative impact
on     , depending on the sign of the parameters of equation (26).

     4. Empirical studies



As explained by McCombie et al. (2002), there are several issues related with the Verdoorn’s law
specification. An extensive review on this matter can be found on McCombie et al. (2002). In this
subsection, some empirical application on Verdoorn’s law will be discussed.

León-Ledesma (2002) estimated the Verdoorn coefficient for OECD countries and the Verdoorn
coefficient, finding a highly significant coefficient (0,672). Besides the productivity equation, the
author tested the relationship between output growth and export growth. The estimated parameter
was also significant.

Angeriz et al. (2009) estimated the Verdoorn law by using spatial econometric approach for
individual manufacturing industries for EU regional data. Using other variables, such as industrial
specialization and diversity, the authors confirmed the results empirically and that the model is
correctly specified. Alexiadis and Tsagdis (2010) applied spatial econometrics to EU regions during
the period 1977-2005, besides the Verdoorn’s law itself together with other contributing factors to
explain labour productivity growth, such as manufacturing agglomeration, spatial interaction. The
authors, based on the econometric findings, argue that there was a slowdown on labour productivity
due to economic policy.

Naastepad (2006), Storn and Naastepad (2007), and Naastepad and Storm (2012), tested equation
(26) below for a large sample of OCDE and Latin American countries, for different periods, given
the lack of data for many countries. In order to study the regime demand from the empirical point of
view, the authors estimated the follow equation:

                                                                                   (26)

in which   is productivity growth,   income growth and     real wage growth.

The results showed that the Verdoorn coefficient is significant. In addition to this, the parameter
related to real wages ( ) is positive and significant.

Hein and Tarassow (2010) conducted an empirical exercise to estimate the productivity regime for
Australia, France, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States from 1960 to 2007.
The authors used the database from Annual Macro-Economic Database of the European
Commission (AMECO). The authors estimated the following equations to analyze the demand
regime:

                                                                                  (27)

In which is the labour productivity, Y is the GPD, w real wage, sh is the share of manufacturing
sector, GAP is gap related with US labour’s productivity. Furthermore, the authors assessed the
possibility of structural breaks using dummies variables. The statistical methodology used in the
paper was the Autoregressive Vectors (VEC).

This study found that Germany, UK and USA’s economies were wage-led, which was reinforced by
the productivity regime. Thus, increases in profit share have negative effects on the demand, and
hence on economic growth. In France, despite the demand regime being wage-led, the authors
found no significant effect of the profit share on the productivity regime, i.e., in France, the
relationship between the demand regime and the productivity regime was unclear. For economies
such as Australia and the Netherlands, the demand regime found was profit-led, reinforced by
productivity regime.

   5. Econometric exercise

Besides the theoretical model, the real exchange rate squared is tested as indicated by Missio,
Jayme Jr, Britto and Oreiro (2015) in order to test non-linearity in the real exchange rate, as
follows:

                                                                                   (1)

In which

The estimation of equation (1) followed the traditional steps: i) stationary tests; ii) cointegration
test; iii) regressions.

The estimation strategy used is the same applied in the previous subsection. The first step is to
analyse in which case the variables are stationary for each variable and country. Hence,
Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS), (1992) tests were applied. In the KPSS tests, the null
hypothesis is that the time series are stationary was verified for most countries (Mexico and
Venezuela were exceptions when variables were taken in levels), that the series are stationary in
levels as well as in first differences. Hence, in a conservative strategy, all series are integrated of
order one, I(1).
The next step was to carry out the Multiple Breakpoint test (or Bai-Perron (2003) tests). For this test
was found breakpoints to the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and
Venezuela. As breakpoints were found in the series, dummy variables were included in order
correct the problem. The Multiple breakpoint tests for the countries that present structural breaks
are reported in the appendix.

An LS model was estimated, as indicated by the KPSS unit root test. All these results are reported
in the appendix of this research. The next step is to estimate the productivity equation for the
selected countries.

  Unfortunately, the variable real wage of the total worker’s compensation was not found. Actually, it was found the
Unemployment, total (% of total labour force) (national estimate). In order to obtain the employment rate, it was made
the following account for each period: 100-Unemployment.

Note: First difference is applied for all variables. The estimation method was Least Squares corrected by HAC standard
errors & covariance (Bartlett kernel, Newey-West fixed. The t–statistics are the numbers in parentheses below each
coefficient. SE is the standard error. D.W. is Durbin–Watson statistic. F is the F-statistic and prob > F is the probability
associated with observing an F-statistic. Furthermore, Dummies variables were applied when needed. All the tests that
justify applying these methodologies are reported in the Appendix.


In order to chose the best model, for instance AR(1), or ARMA(1,1) and etc, the strategy was to
combine i) the F is the probability associated with observing an F-statistic close to zero; and ii) the
Durbin–Watson statistic as close as possible to 2.00.

Table (2) shows the results of the estimated productivity equations. The regressions were made
using the Least Squared, Robust Least Squared, Least Squared correcting the autocorrelation and
heteroskedasticity by the HAC matrix. The overall outcome is that the Kaldor-Verdoorn coefficient
is significant for all countries. The coefficient for Argentina is (0.52), Brazil (0.70), Bolivia (0.63),
Chile (0.28), Colombia (0.80), Mexico (0.55), Uruguay (0.86) and Venezuela (0.86).

The parameters estimated in this research are similar with those estimated for Latin American
countries by other authors (the exception is made for Chile, in which the parameter is smaller than
the findings in the literature). Such studies in this topic for Latin American countries include
Acevedo et al. (2009), Borgoglio and Odisio (2015), Britto and McCombie (2015), Carton (2009),
Destefanis (2002), Libanio (2006), Oliveira, Jayme Jr. and Lemos (2006) and others.

The wage-push variable is the employment rate (DLne). The parameter is significant for Bolivia and
Chile, and the parameters values are (-0.12) and (0.66) respectively, meaning that Bolivia is a
profit-led regime and Chile a wage-led regime. In the case of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
Uruguay and Venezuela the parameter is not significant. One possible explanation for these results
comes from the Latin America Structuralist School, which argues that productivity growth is
fundamentally different in developed and in developing countries. In the latter, high and low
productivity sectors coexist. This heterogeneity in the productive sector slows down the
productivity transmission across the economic system. Therefore, real wage growth (employment
growth) is not statically significant.

Regarding the real exchange rate parameter, the real exchange rate was tested and the real exchange
rate squared, in order to test for non-linearities. For all countries, except Colombia, the parameter
(𝐷𝑙             ), 𝐷𝑙               or both is/are significant, however negative. In the case of
Colombia either the parameters are significant. Given the theoretical discussion presented before,
these results may mean that the real exchange rate devaluation increases the cost of imported
capital, reducing productivity growth. This indicates that the level of the real exchange rate in these
countries impacted negatively productivity growth in the period under consideration. There is an
extensive body of work on the relationship between the RER and growth, such as Rodrik (2008),
Bragança and Libânio (2008), Araújo (2009), Rapetti et al. (2012), Oreiro and Araujo (2013),
Nassif et al. (2015), Missio, Jayme Jr., Oreiro and Britto (2015b), Cavallo et al. (1990), Dollar
(1992), Razin and Collins (1997), Benaroya and Janci (1999), Acemoglu et al. (2002) and
Fajnzylber et al. (2002) and Gala (2008). However, most of the work on the theme focuses on
exchange rate misalignments. In this research, the focus is on real exchange rate change and level.
This difference is important because the result reach in this research does not disagree with the
results found in the literature. Finally, the real exchange rate coefficient for Chile is positive and
significant, and the parameter is (0.17). In this case, real exchange rate has a positive impact on
productivity growth.

   6. Conclusion

The main goal of this research was to assess the relationship between the real exchange rate and
productivity growth. The secondary objectives were to study the relationship between economic
growth (through the so call Verdoorn coefficient) and the interaction between productivity growth
and real wage growth. These relationships (productivity growth, real wage growth and income
growth) have been explored on several papers (for instance Naastepad (2006) and Hein and
Tarassow (2010).

One novelty in the present research is to present a theoretical approach that establishes a
relationship between the real exchange rate and productivity. In this case, the real exchange rate
also is related to the investment function, since the productivity growth is a separate variable in the
investment function. The second novelty is that from a theoretical point of view, a country in which
the demand regime is profit-led, increases in real wage can reduce productivity. At the same time,
in a profit-led demand regime, real exchange rate devaluations can have a negative impact on
productivity because real exchange rate devaluation can increase the capital cost of imported
materials.

The empirical experiment performed to Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
Uruguay and Venezuela has as an overall outcome that the Kaldor-Verdoorn coefficient is
significant for all analysed countries. Nevertheless, the estimated coefficients in this research are
bigger than the parameters estimated to Latin American countries elsewhere. The wage-push
variable is significant for only two countries, Bolivia and Chile, indicating that in Bolivia the
regime is profit-led, whereas in Chile the regime is wage-led. Regarding to the real exchange rate
and this variable taken in squared, the parameters are negative for all countries, indicating that real
exchange rate devaluation does not increase productivity growth. However, future studies should
take in consideration exchange rate misalignments for these countries, but using panel data analysis.
It could alter the result found in this study.
