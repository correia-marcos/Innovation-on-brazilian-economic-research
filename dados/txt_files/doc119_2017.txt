Abstract: We investigate the existence of an asymmetry in the exchange rate pass-through to the Brazilian
consumer price index (CPI). Using a decomposition of the exchange rate series, into appreciations and
depreciations of the Brazilian currency during the 1999-2016 period, we estimate Structural Vector Auto-
regression (SVAR) models with different identifying restrictions. The results are robust and indicate a relevant
asymmetric behavior of the exchange rate pass-through. Estimates indicate a pass-through of 16% in case of
depreciation, and of 5.8% in case of appreciation of Brazilian Real (BRL) against the US Dollar. Accordingly,
the inflationary effect resulted from a (systematic) depreciation is only partially compensated by a deflationary
effect of an (systematic) appreciation of the same magnitude, generating an inflationary bias that may cast
doubts on inflation control strategies based solely on inflation targeting. Results provide a case against excess
exchange volatility and capital mobility. A stable exchange rate favors price stability.

Resumo: O artigo investiga a existência de repasse cambial assimétrico para o IPCA no Brasil. Usando uma
decomposição da taxa de câmbio em apreciações e depreciações durante o período de 1999 a 2016 são
estimados modelos SVAR. Os resultados são robustos e indicam existência de um relevante comportamento
assimétrico do repasse cambial. As estimativas indicam um repasse de 16% após uma depreciação e de 5,8%
após uma apreciação do Real contra o Dólar americano. Desta forma, o efeito inflacionário resultante de uma
depreciação (sistemática) é apenas parcialmente compensado por um efeito deflacionário de uma apreciação
(sistemática) da mesma magnitude, gerando um viés inflacionário que leva a questionamentos a respeito da
estratégia de controle da inflação pelo Regime de Metas de Inflação. Os resultados fornecem argumentos contra
uma volatilidade excessiva da taxa de câmbio com mobilidade de capitais. Uma taxa de câmbio estável
favorece o controle de preços.

1. Introduction

         Brazil’s long experience with high inflation and external shocks to its currency makes Brazilian
policymakers, and the public alike, worry about the inflation rate every time one observes excessive movement
in the exchange rate markets. In the past, in an inflationary environment, shocks to the exchange rate and
depreciations of the Brazilian currency in particular, ended up being passed through to consumer prices. Even
though inflation rates have stabilized and the exchange rate pass-through have allegedly declined during the
last decade, the transmission of exchange rates shocks to domestic prices remains a concern to the monetary
authorities. The exchange rate pass-through is defined as the domestic prices percentage change after a 1%
exchange rate variation. Exchange rate fluctuations can affect domestic prices directly or indirectly. Directly,
it affects prices of inputs used in domestic production and prices of imported final goods. Thus, the magnitude
of direct effects depends on the share of imported goods on domestic consumption and production.
         Indirectly, exchange rate fluctuations affect the demand for domestically produced goods that compete
with imported goods. Indirect effect depends on the elasticity of substitution between domestic and imported
goods. A depreciation of the local currency, for example, raises the internal demand for domestic goods vis-à-
vis imported goods, while increases the competitiveness of local exports. At a given supply level, a raise in
exports may result in inflationary pressures (over domestic inputs and wages). Additionally, administered (or
government controlled) prices formally or informally indexed to the exchange rate may also affect domestic
inflation.
         The literature usually assumes a long-term relationship between price level and exchange rate.
Accordingly, it is usually assumed that the exchange rate pass-through is symmetric – or that the effect of
appreciations and depreciations of the local currency (on CPI) have the same magnitude (McCarty, 2007;
Gagnon and Ihrig, 2004; Campa and Goldberg, 2005; Choudhri and Hakura, 2006; Kohlscheen, 2010; and for
Brazil Belaisch, 2003; Minella et al., 2003; Nogueira, 2007; Araújo and Modenesi, 2010). However, there are
several micro and macroeconomic theoretical reasons that justify the possible existence of an asymmetric
exchange rate pass-through – that is, the effect of currency appreciations and depreciations (on CPI) may not
have the same magnitude.
         This chapter aims at investigating the existence of an asymmetric exchange rate pass-through to
consumer prices in Brazil. The Brazilian Central Bank (BCB)2 has adopted the inflation targeting regime in
1999 and uses the Brazilian Consumer Price Index (IPCA).3 There are many studies estimating the symmetric
exchange rate pass-through to IPCA. In the international literature, almost all studies that focus on the
asymmetry of the pass-through analyses the pass-through to imported prices.
         Our contribution to the current literature is mostly empirical, and the results help highlighting two
important and intertwined theoretical points. Firstly, an asymmetric pass-through may be an additional
explanation for downward price rigidity. Secondly, our results provide a strong case against excess exchange
rate volatility and capital mobility as supported by the Post Keynesian literature. Empirically, we provide
evidence on the existence of an asymmetric exchange rate pass-through to the Brazilian Consumer Price Index.
In a departure from the previous literature, we focus specifically on the asymmetric exchange rate pass-through
to IPCA. We believe that by analyzing the pass-through to a more general price index (the IPCA), we do not
restrict ourselves to the possible cost effects of imported prices. Using a decomposition of the exchange rate
series into appreciations and depreciations of the Brazilian currency, we estimate Structural Vector
Autoregression (SVAR) models and provide estimates of the magnitude of the pass-through in case of

appreciations and depreciations of the local currency. Our results support the hypothesis of a strong asymmetry
in the exchange rate pass-through for the IPCA.
        Our chapter contains three sections besides this introduction and the concluding remarks. Section 2
presents a very brief overview of the recent macroeconomic performance and macroeconomic policy in Brazil.
We highlight three stylized facts: 1) the low inflation’s sensitivity to the interest rate; 2) the key role of the
exchange rate in the monetary policy transmission channel; and 3) the existence of a downward rigidity in the
IPCA. Section 3 reviews the literature on the exchange rate pass-through. Finally, we present some implications
of the asymmetric pass-through to inflation dynamics and macroeconomic policy.

2. Inflation and Macroeconomic Policy in Brazil: A brief overview

        During the 1980s and early 1990s the Brazilian economy presented a process of chronic high inflation.
Most economists agreed that inflation had become inertial, as far as the population had incorporated the
inflationary memory: (current) prices were indexed to past inflation (Modenesi, 2005, chapters 4-5).
        With the adoption of the Real Plan in mid-1994, inflation was put under control. The Real Plan was a
price stabilization strategy based on the adoption of a new monetary standard and the implementation of an
exchange rate anchor. The plan was successful in controlling inflation. Inflation fell sharply after the launch of
the Real Plan, reaching levels that had not been observed for decades in the Brazilian economy (Reis et al.,
2016, 169-70).
        In 1999, a set of policies was adopted, so called macroeconomic tripod, based on: inflation targeting
regime; floating exchange rate, with high capital mobility; and primary surplus targets. Price stability was
pursued by fixing the basic interest rate (Selic rate)4 in line with a Taylor rule. Accordingly, Selic rate was
set aiming at controlling simultaneously aggregate demand and, though not directly, the exchange rate,
which has been the most relevant monetary policy transmission channel. Fiscal policy, in turn, assumed a
supporting role, limited to avoiding inflationary pressures and keeping a stable debt/GDP relation (Reis et
al. 2016, 170-2). This policy was in line with the New Consensus in Macroeconomics.5
        One should note that since the Real Plan, Brazil set a world record in terms of (real) interest rates,
and the BRL was one of the most overvalued currencies during the last two decades (Graph 1). The high
interest rates attracted carry trade operations and contributed to an overvaluation of the BRL.6 In turn, the
overvaluation of the BRL facilitated inflation control.

  In Brazil, the basic interest rate goes by the acronym (Selic) for Sistema Especial de Liquidação e de Custódia (Special System for
Settlement and Custody), which is the settlement system for most domestic securities of the Brazilian government.
5
   The New Consensus on Macroeconomics (Blinder, 1981, 1998; Taylor, 1993, 2000; Allsopp e Vines, 2000; Romer, 2000) is
associated with the growing popularity of inflation targeting and the resulting acceptance that, even where the regime is not adopted,
the main instrument of monetary policy is the (basic) interest rate, and no longer the monetary aggregates of some decades ago,
influenced by monetarism. The new consensus theoretical core is given by the confluence of monetarism, new classical and real
business cycle theories. The natural rate of unemployment (Friedman, 1968) and rational expectations hypothesis are among the two
most relevant assumptions shared by this large group of economists. Another fundamental part is the Taylor rule – which holds that
the central banks should determine its interest rate aiming at an explicit or implicit inflation target, and at keeping GDP growth near
to its potential. We agree with Lavoie that “the only truly new element in the new consensus […] is the rejection of the exogenous
supply of money, and the replacement of money growth rule for a real interest rate targeting rule […]” (Lavoie, 2004, p. 23).

        Although Brazil has one of the world’s higher interest rates, the BCB has had difficulties meeting its
inflation targets (see Graph 2). During 18 years of inflation targeting adoption, upper limit was exceeded in
four years (2001, 2002, 2003 and 2015); the center of the target was reached in only three years (2000, 2007
and 2009); and IPCA was below the center of the target only in 2006. During this period, annual inflation
averaged around 7%, well above the 4.5% target rate.

        In fact, Brazilian inflation has proven rather resilient despite high interest levels set by the BCB (annual
inflation rates have been below 5% only in three out of eighteen years period). This suggests there is something
sui generis in inflation dynamics and in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy which causes Brazilian
inflation to not respond – or to remain less sensitive – to contractionary monetary policy. 7 Indeed, an ample set

  According to existing literature (Modenesi and Modenesi, 2012): among the main empirical-institutional features of Brazilian
economy that compromises the monetary policy transmission, these are noteworthy: i) non-existence of a yield curve for sufficiently
long maturity periods; ii) the high share of administered prices in the IPCA; iii) existence of a perverse cost channel; and iv) the so-
called LFT problem (Modenesi and Modenesi, 2012). LFT (Letras Financeiras do Tesouro, in Portuguese) is a special kind of
government bonds that are indexed to Selic.
                                                                                                                                       4
of empirical evidence indicates that the monetary policy transmission mechanism may not be properly
functioning. For instance, Modenesi and Araújo (2013) found that the sensibility of the IPCA to the Selic rate
is low.
         The low sensitivity of the Brazilian inflation to the interest rate level is remarkable and has been widely
documented (Modenesi et al., 2017, 206-7). This means that an increase in the Selic rate seems to have limited
deflationary impact through the demand channel. For this reason, the BCB – according to the inflation targeting
regime – would need to maintain the basic interest rate in excessively high levels in order to meet its inflation
targets.
         The costs of practicing high levels of interest rate are not negligible. The effect of an increase in the
Selic rate on the economic activity level is negative. In response to a rise in interest rate, economy decelerates
and employment increases. Monetary rigidity is one of the reasons – although not the sole – for the poor
performance of Brazilian economy during analyzed period.8 The GDP growth rate remained below 6% in the
1999-2016 period (except in 2010, when it exceeded 7.5%), and above 5% in only four years (2004, 2007,
2008, 2010). Such results have proved to be worse than for other emergent countries that have considerably
higher growth rates (Graph 3).

        The BRL also appreciates in response to an increase in Selic rate. The high differential between
domestic interest rate and foreign rates contributed to the expressive appreciation of the BRL that occurred
after 2003, reducing export competitiveness. The BRL is one of the currencies that have appreciated more
recently: for instance, in 2011, the average exchange rate was inferior to its value in 1999.
        It is worth noting that overvaluation of the BRL is not an undesirable byproduct of the high-interest
rate policy. On the contrary, the BRL appreciation has been the core of price stabilization strategy, since the
Real Plan. Araújo and Modenesi (2010) suggested that exchange rate was more relevant than the economic
activity level to explain Brazilian inflation dynamics. In fact, exchange rate has been the most relevant
transmission channel of monetary policy (Arestis et al. 2011; Modenesi and Araújo, 2013). This is a second
(and well known) stylized fact of Brazilian economy.
        Summing up, despite of the extremely high interest rates and strong overvaluation of the BRL, BCB
was not able to maintain inflation at expected reasonable levels. In other words, although in relative control,
inflation presented downward rigidity. This can be seen as another stylized fact of Brazilian economy after
the Real Plan. A common explanation is that the practice of price indexation was not fully eliminated. Some

  Even recognizing that Brazil’s rates of growth in the 1980’s were low, one cannot deny that monetary policy has, at least, constituted
a relevant hindrance to the reversal of this situation.
                                                                                                                                       5
key prices – for instance, some public tariffs, such as public transportation and energy; and also petroleum
products and rents – are indexed to past inflation by law. Indeed, administrated inflation (one third of IPCA)
drove inflation rates above the target until the early 2007 and after 2015. As a rule, prices in general (and
also wages) are also indexed to inflation (in a 12 months basis).9 Inflation presents a highly inertial
component and thus, controlling aggregate demand – via monetary or fiscal policy – has proven to have
limited efficacy in curbing inflationary pressures. For instance, in 2017, only after two consecutive years of
economic recession and an unemployment rate of 12%, inflation rates finally declined. Note that, in 2015-
6 Brazil experienced the most drastic recession of history (Graph 3).
        We provide evidence for yet another reason for IPCA’s downward rigidity or inflation resilience:
the existence of an asymmetric exchange rate pass-through.

     3. Review of Literature
3.1 Exchange Rate Pass-through in Brazil
         There is a vast literature that estimates the symmetric exchange rate pass-through in Brazil. Belaisch
(2003) estimates VAR models, from July 1999 to December 2002. Model specification follows McCarthy
(2007) and uses the exchange rate, IMF oil index price and industrial output index (IBGE).10 The exchange
rate pass-through for consumer prices was estimated at 17% after 12 months.
         A group of authors also estimated symmetric models with specifications based on Belaisch (2003) and
McCarthy (2007): Squeff (2009), Araújo and Modenesi (2010), Souza and Alves (2011) and Nogueira et al.
(2013). Other studies also used VAR models with different specifications: Minella et al. (2003), Nogueira
(2006), Menezes and Fernandes (2012) and Fraga and Couto (2012). In all these studies, the econometric model
is linear and symmetric.
         According to literature, exchange rate pass-through has been reduced over time in several countries.
Squeff (2009) and Souza and Alvez (2011) divided the analyzed period into two sub-samples. In both studies
it was found that the first period (1999-2003) presented a higher exchange rate pass-through than in the second
one (2003-2007 and 2003-2009, respectively).
         It is important to highlight, however, that in both studies the second sub-sample is a period of
continuous appreciation of the BRL.
         Souza et al. (2013) and Almendra et al. (2015) estimated exchange rate pass-through using State Space
models that allowed for time varying parameters.11 Marodin and Portugal (2015) estimated a Markov
Switching Phillips Curve for Brazil from 2000 to 2015. Their results showed evidence of two distinct regimes
for the exchange rate pass-through.12
         Correa and Minella (2010) analyzed the existence of nonlinearities in the Phillips Curve through
estimation of a threshold autoregressive model (TAR) with consumer prices, exchange rate and the output gap.
The results indicate existence of a non-linear relationship between the exchange rate pass-through and the
economic cycle. When the output gap is below the estimated 1.89% threshold, the exchange rate pass-through
is not statistically different from zero. However, when the output gap is above the threshold, the estimated

  Administered prices represents around 30% of CPI in Brazil. Many of them are (directly or indirectly) indexed to exchange rate.
One should note that not all administrated prices are indexed to past inflation.
10
   In the McCarthy (2007) model, inflation is determined by ’supply’ shocks, ‘demand’ shocks and the exchange rate.
11
    One should conclude, that in both studies, the results showed that exchange rate pass-through was higher during periods of
depreciation of the local currency than in periods of appreciation.
12
   Under the so-called ‘normal’ regime, the pass-through to consumer prices was not statistically significant. Comparatively, the
expected pass-through under a ‘crisis’ regime is of 10%. ‘Crisis’ periods occurred from 2000 to 2003 and in 2015, years in which
the BRL depreciated. The ‘normal’ cycle extends from 2003 to 2014, years of continuous appreciation of the local currency (except
for July to November 2008).
                                                                                                                               6
pass-through is 9%. Devaluations of the local currency larger than the 2.1% threshold lead to an estimated
pass-through of 11% (after three months). Pass-throughs of appreciations (small or large), on the other hand,
were not statistically significant.
        Carneiro et al. (2004) estimated a backward-looking Phillips curve with a nonlinear specification to the
pass-through coefficient for the period from 1994 to 2001. The model considers different components of
consumer price index (industrialized, services and food) and the exchange rate and unemployment rate as
determinants of inflation. The nonlinear specification presented a pass-through of 5.6% for 1999, 6% for 2000
and 7.7% for 2001. The empirical evidence obtained by the authors also suggested the existence of different
nonlinear pass-through mechanism among different price groups.
        Most international econometric studies estimate exchange rate pass-through to import prices and to
producer prices. Only a few studies focus consumer prices. 13 Results, in general, present evidences of
asymmetric exchange rate pass-through, although the direction and magnitude vary from country to country
and with the industry analyzed.
        Although it is possible to use nonlinear estimation methods most studies estimates autoregressive
distributed lag (ARDL) and vector autoregressive (VAR) models and decompose the exchange rate series in
two new variables, one for appreciation observations and another for depreciations.
        Summing up, there are many studies estimating the symmetric exchange rate pass-through to consumer
price in Brazil. In the international literature, studies that focus on the asymmetry of the pass-through usually
use imported prices. Our main contribution is to provide evidence on the existence of an asymmetric exchange
pass-through to consumer price in Brazil. We innovate by using a decomposition of the exchange rate series
into appreciations and depreciations of the BRL.

3.2. Asymmetric Exchange Rate Pass-through: Theory

        According to existing theoretical literature, asymmetric exchange rate pass-through is usually
understood to mean that domestic currency appreciations and depreciations have different magnitude impact
over prices.14
        As Webber (1999) notes, the theoretical literature offers three groups of explanations for asymmetry:
(i) marketing constraints, formulated by Foster and Baldwin (1986) and Knetter (1994); refers to the case where
exporters are unable to raise their sales in face of an increased demand for imports as a result of a fall in price
caused by an appreciation of the local currency (this situation results in exchange rate pass-through after
devaluations greater than after appreciations); (ii) production technology switching; if the producing firm has
the possibility to buy its inputs not only domestically but also to import, appreciations may result in a higher
exchange rate pass-through than depreciations (Ware and Winter, 1988); and (iii) market share objectives; this
possibility is usually alluded by Pricing to Market literature, notably by Froot and Klemperer (1989), Marston
(1990) and Krugman (1987). It happens when the exporting firms are trying to set the lowest possible price in
the importer currency, in order to increase sales and market share. In this case, exchange rate pass-through
after appreciations is higher than after depreciations.
        Thus, two of the three theoretical reasons found in literature lead to a higher pass-through after a
currency appreciation rather than after a depreciation. It is, however, generally believed that prices are rigid



13
    For instance, Brun-Aguerre (2017), Pollard and Coughlin (2004), Herzberg et al. (2003), Bussiere (2013), Webber (1999b),
Wickremasinghe and Silvapulle (2004), Campa et al. (2008), Alvarez et al. (2008), Gil-Pareja (2000), and Karoro et al. (2009),
estimate asymmetric exchange rate pass-through to import prices. Khundrakpam (2007) employ producer prices. Mihaljek and Klau
(2008), Przystupa and Wróbel (2009), Delatte and López-Villavicencio (2011) utilize asymmetric exchange rate pass-through to
consumer prices. All these papers decompose the exchange rate in appreciations and depreciations.
14
     Sometimes it also refers to the speed that exchange rate fluctuations affect prices.
                                                                                                                            7
downward due to firms being more likely to increase their mark-up than to reduce it. In this case, the effects
over prices after a depreciation of the currency would be greater than after an appreciation. Therefore, literature
on downward rigidity of prices and asymmetric price transmission also apply to asymmetric exchange rate
pass-through.
        From a macroeconomic perspective, the exchange rate pass-through may be asymmetric if the Monetary
Authority is concerned with inflationary pressures arising from exchange rate movements and reacts more
strongly after a currency devaluation than after an appreciation (Delatte and Villavicencio, 2011). Furthermore,
the exchange rate pass-through may depend on the level of economic activity. In periods of economic
recessions, for example, the effects of a depreciation in raising prices may be smaller than the effects of an
appreciation in reducing domestic prices (Goldfajn and Werlang, 2000).
        In general, literature suggests that price adjustments to exchange rate fluctuations depend on market
structures and firm pricing strategies, which will differ from industry to industry and from country to country.15
The existence and direction of asymmetric exchange rate pass-through to prices may not be asserted a priori.
Generally, industries producing homogeneous and globally marketable products should present a higher pass-
through and less possibility of asymmetry, whereas industries whose products are more differentiated and
where market structure is less competitive have greater possibility of presenting asymmetries and
nonlinearities.

            4. Asymmetric Exchange Rate Pass-through: empirical evidence from Brazil (1999-2016)

4.1. Data Base
         The econometric model estimated is based on Belaisch (2003) and Araújo and Modenesi (2010), and
own elaboration as above, and is extensively used in the Brazilian exchange rate pass-through literature.
Inflation is determined by its lags and three other factors: i) aggregate demand (or level of economic activity)
as measured by industrial output; ii) aggregate supply conditions, a commodity price index is used as proxy;
and (iii) the nominal exchange rate.
         Intuition behind this equation is simple. Inflation dynamics depends on three components: i) aggregate
demand; ii) supply (or cost) conditions; and iii) the exchange rate. In line with Vernengo (2006), this equation
comprises both orthodox and heterodox theories of inflation. Friedman (1968), an exponent of orthodox theory,
emphasizes demand pressures (resulting from excessive money supply). Davidson (2003), a prominent Post
Keynesian author, advocates cost-push inflation pressure. Finally, there is a lot empirical evidence showing
that exchange rate plays a significant role in inflation dynamics (Taylor, 2001), particularly in emerging
economies (see for instance, Silva and Vernengo, 2008-2009).
         All variables are monthly observations for the period from August 1999 to June 2016 and are used in
first difference of logarithms. August 1999 was chosen as the starting period for two reasons. Firstly, inflation
targeting regime was officially established in Brazil in June 1999. Secondly, there is a major methodological
break in the IPCA in August 1999 when components weights were updated. The variables used are described
below (and plotted in the Appendix):

     i)        CPI: Consumer price index, measured by IBGE and used in Brazilian IT Regime
     ii)       Y: industrial output (quantum) measured by IBGE as proxy for aggregate demand.
     iii)      COMM: a commodities price index, constructed with IMF commodities prices data using method
               proposed by the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) (Nonnenberg and
               Lameiras, 2005) as proxy for aggregate supply conditions.


15
  According to Goldfajn and Werlang (2000), Calvo and Reinhart (2000) and Frenkel et al (2005), ERTP is higher for the emerging
countries than for developed countries. Additionally, in emerging countries, with currencies placed at the lower end of the currency
hierarchy, exchange rate is prone to be more volatile (Paula et. al, 2017).
                                                                                                                                   8
     iv)     ER: Exchange rate BRL/USD, monthly average provided by BCB.

         The industrial output index was chosen as a proxy due to non-availability of a monthly series suitable
for economic activity at the aggregate level. Although industrial output is frequently used in the Brazilian
econometric literature, it should be noted that this indicator has limitations because it represents only about
30% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
         A commodities price index was calculated using a method proposed by IPEA (Nonnenberg and
Lameiras, 2005). Commodity prices from IMF database were weighted according to the Brazilian production
structure measured by the producer price index (PPI) provided by Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV).
         Usually the Brazilian exchange rate pass-through econometric literature uses IMF’s commodities index.
It is an important remark, however, that in IMF’s index the oil prices share is higher (53.6%) than in COMM
index (18%). Also, food and beverage share in IMF’s index is lower (13.8%) than in COMM index (48%).
         The commodity price index can be a proxy for international cost conditions. An increase in commodities
prices can be interpreted as a supply shock leading to inflationary pressures (Araújo and Modenesi, 2010).
Furthermore, given the high share of commodities in Brazil's exports, an increase in commodities prices may
imply higher profit for exporters and a positive demand shock. In other words, external variables (exchange
rate and commodities prices) may represent supply shocks (via costs) and demand shocks (via exports). In both
cases, an increase in commodities prices is expected to have a positive effect on consumer prices leading to
inflationary pressures.
         The exchange rate series was decomposed into two series based on period-to-period price variations,
as presented in the appendix. The currency devaluation series presents only positive exchange rate variations
whereas the currency appreciation series presents only negative exchange rate variations. One should note that
a decrease in exchange rate (BRL/USD) is equivalent to an appreciation of BRL.

4.2. Econometric Estimation and Results
        As most macroeconomic variables are inter-related, an autoregressive system (VAR) is the benchmark
model widely used by macroeconomists. In VAR models, macroeconomic variables may be all treated as
endogenously determine.16
        Two SVAR models were estimated, a symmetric and an asymmetric model.17
    i)     Symmetric: 𝑌𝑡 = (∆𝐶𝑃𝐼𝑡 , ∆𝐸𝑅𝑡 , ∆𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑀𝑡 , ∆𝑌𝑡 )′
    ii)    Asymmetric: 𝑌𝑡 = (∆𝐶𝑃𝐼𝑡 , ∆𝐸𝑅𝑡+ , ∆𝐸𝑅𝑡− , ∆𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑀𝑡 , ∆𝑌𝑡 )′

        Where CPI is the consumer price index; ER is the exchange rate; 𝐸𝑅𝑡+ , increases in exchange rate
(BRL/USD), equivalent to depreciations of Brazilian currency; 𝐸𝑅𝑡− decreases in exchange rate (BRL/USD),
equivalent to appreciations of Brazilian currency; COMM is the commodities price index and Y is industrial
output, as described previously.
        Model specification in SVAR context involves selecting lag order and imposing restrictions on SVAR
parameters in order to estimate impulse response functions and variance decomposition. Details about SVAR
identification are presented in appendix.
        The criterion to impose restrictions was the analysis of the error correlation matrix and the selection of
the pairs of variables with high correlation errors. Then restrictions were imposed only for the selected pairs:
i) commodities prices contemporaneously affect all other variables; ii) exchange rate contemporaneously
affects industrial output and consumer prices iii) industrial output contemporaneously affects consumer prices.

                                                                                                                                 9
        The selection of the lag order was used to find the most parsimonious model with well-behaved residues
that satisfied the stability condition, i.e. that the characteristic polynomial inverse roots lie inside the unit
circle.18 The symmetric and asymmetric models were estimated with the same number of lags so that results
could be directly compared.
        Wald coefficient restriction tests were performed for the asymmetric model to test the hypothesis that
local currency depreciations coefficients are statistically different from currency appreciations coefficients.
Two different specifications of the Wald test were implemented, as presented in the appendix, and for both of
them test statistics reject the null hypothesis that coefficients are equal at conventional significance levels.
Therefore, results indicate the existence of asymmetry, i.e. that exchange rate devaluations have different
effects on inflation than exchange rate appreciations.
        Variance decomposition analysis can be used for interpreting the interrelated dynamic in SVAR models.
This method estimates the amount of variation in each of the endogenous variables in the system of equations
due to exogenous shocks in each of the other endogenous variables over some period. Thus, the variance
decomposition provides information about the relative importance of shocks in affecting the variables in the
SVAR.19
        In table 1, the second column contains the forecast error of the variable at the given forecast horizon.
The remaining columns give the percentage of the forecast variance due to each shock with each row adding
up to 100.
        Table 1 shows variance decomposition of the symmetric and asymmetric models. For the symmetric
model, the results show that exchange rate shocks are the major factor affecting consumer price variations.
Commodity prices are the second most relevant factor, although its share after 12 periods in consumer price
variations (2.1%) is much lower than the exchange rate (26.6%). Industrial output is the least relevant factor
with only 1% of the consumer price variance being explained by its shocks.
        For the asymmetric model (lower part of Table 1), results indicate that shocks to commodity prices and
industrial output result in forecast error percentages in consumer price variations (after 12 months) similar to
those obtained for the symmetric model. In the asymmetric model, the exchange rate series was decomposed
into positive (currency devaluations) and negative (currency appreciations) variations. Together, they represent
27.6% of consumer price variance after 12 periods, a result also similar to the symmetric model. However,
when analyzed separately, currency devaluations shocks have a greater share in price variance (24%) than
currency appreciations (3,6%). This result gives further evidence for asymmetric exchange rate pass-through.

        As the exchange rate pass-through can be defined as the percentage response of prices to a one percent
shock in the exchange rate (McCarthy, 2007; Campa and Goldberg, 2005), it can be also calculated from the
impulse response functions estimated from SVAR models.
        Table 2 shows the symmetric and asymmetric estimated exchange rate pass-through for Brazil from
1999 to 2016. As expected, results show that pass-through after a currency devaluation is higher (16%) than
after an appreciation (5.8%).

       In summary, the results of the three analysis (Wald tests, variance decomposition and exchange rate
estimation) offer compelling evidence of asymmetric exchange rate pass-through with pass-through after a
devaluation being higher than after an appreciation.

5. Concluding Remarks: Inflation Dynamics and Policy Implications

        The present chapter analyzes exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices in Brazil. The main
objective is to search for evidence of asymmetric pass-through to consumer prices, i.e., that devaluations of
the domestic currency affect domestic prices differently from appreciations. The analysis covers the period
from August 1999 to June 2016, beginning after the adoption of the IT regime and de facto dirty floating
exchange rate.
        In this chapter, asymmetric exchange rate pass-through is investigated through the estimation of SVAR
models with exchange rate decomposed, period by period, into currency devaluations and appreciations.
        Wald coefficient restrictions tests and variance decomposition analysis are performed and symmetric
and asymmetric pass-through are estimated through impulse response functions. Taken together, the results
offer compelling evidence of asymmetric exchange rate pass-through in Brazil. Estimated pass-through after a
currency devaluation is 16% while after an appreciation 5.8%.
        It is important to highlight a relevant implication of our results for inflation dynamics. The asymmetric
exchange rate pass-through implies that the inflationary effect of (systematic) currency devaluation is not fully
offset by the deflationary effect of (systematic) appreciation of the same magnitude.
        For instance, consider a currency devaluation followed by an appreciation of the same magnitude so
that the exchange rate returns to its initial level. Given a symmetric exchange rate pass-through, the final effect
on inflation would be zero. After the currency appreciation, the price level would eventually return to the level
observed before the initial devaluation. In other words, the inflationary impact on prices of the devaluation
would be completely offset by the deflationary effect of the currency appreciation. In the presence of
asymmetry, the net result will be an increase in price level.
        To illustrate this result, we simulated the impact of exchange rate variations on IPCA from 1999 through
2016, based on our estimations (Table 4). The bold line in Graph 4 shows the trajectory of the IPCA under
                                                                                                                          12
asymmetric pass-through, while the dotted line shows the simulated index under the hypothesis of a symmetric
pass-through. The asymmetric pass-through simulation results in a strong upward trend: Accumulated inflation
is around 50%. For the symmetric pass-through (dotted line), the simulated IPCA fluctuates around its initial
level: Eventually, accumulated inflation would converge to zero.20

        In a few words, if pass-through were symmetric, exchange rate fluctuations would have a neutral
inflationary impact. The asymmetric exchange rate pass-through implies that the inflationary effect of a
(systematic) currency devaluation is not fully offset by the deflationary effect of a (systematic) appreciation of
the same magnitude. In a few words, exchange rate fluctuations may result in an (upward) inflationary bias.
        This empirical result helps to explain a stylized fact of Brazilian economy, the downward rigidity of
the IPCA. This result also cast doubts on the current inflation control strategy, based on IT and de facto dirty
floating exchange rate (with capital mobility).
        Our results provide a strong case against excess exchange rate volatility and capital mobility.
Accordingly, a stable exchange rate may favor price stability. Indeed, many authors favor a stable exchange
rate. For instance, Keynes (1943; 1980, p. 8), Davidson (2003), Kregel (2015), Carvalho (2000-2001), and
Paula et. al (2017), amongst others Post Keynesians authors, advocate exchange rate interventions and capital
controls to stabilize the exchange rate. For Krugman and Obstfeld (1997), an unstable exchange rate raises
uncertainty regarding export/import revenues. Accordingly, excessive exchange rate volatility would
jeopardize trade. Although we do not aim at addressing this debate explicitly, the existence of an asymmetric
pass-through may be another item in the list in favor of stable exchange rates.

  The simulated indexes are a partial analysis that only considers the impact of exchange rate variations on the IPCA for comparative
purposes, not considering other factors also important for the dynamics of the Brazilian inflation rate. The upward trend shown by
the simulated asymmetric index resembles much more the observed trajectory of actual IPCA.

     1.   SVAR model

        Consider a 𝐾-dimensional time series 𝑌𝑡 = (𝑦1 , 𝑦2 , 𝑦3 , 𝑦4 )′ where 𝑌𝑡 is a SVAR of finite order 𝑝 of the
structural form

 𝐴𝑌𝑡 = 𝑣0 + 𝐵1 𝑌𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝐵𝑝 𝑌𝑡−𝑝 + 𝐵𝑢𝑡                                                       (1)

        Where A is a KxK matrix that defines the causal interrelationships among the contemporaneous
variables and 𝑢𝑡 denotes a mean zero uncorrelated error term (also referred to as structural innovation or
structural shock) with a variance-covariance matrix 𝐸 (𝑢𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡′ ) = Σ𝑢 . Because structural shocks are by definition
uncorrelated, Σ𝑢 is a diagonal matrix (KILLIAN, 2011).
        Equation (1) cannot be estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) since the variables have
contemporaneous effects on each other. OLS estimates would suffer from simultaneous equation bias since the
regressors and error terms would be correlated (ENDERS, 2014).
        In order to allow estimation it is necessary to derive its reduced form representation. Premultiplication
on both sides of equation (1) by 𝐴−1 allows the reduced form (2) to be obtained.

𝑌𝑡 = 𝑐0 + Φ1 𝑌𝑡−1 + Φ2 𝑌𝑡−2 + ⋯ + Φ𝑝 𝑌𝑡−𝑝 + 𝑒𝑡                                                (2)
Where 𝑐0 = 𝐴−1 𝑣0 ; Φ𝑖 = 𝐴−1 𝐵𝑖 ; 𝐴𝑒𝑡 = 𝐵𝑢𝑡 .

        Standard OLS method obtain consistent estimates of the reduced form (2) parameters Φ𝑖 , the reduced
form errors 𝑒𝑡 and their covariance matrix 𝐸 (𝑒𝑡 𝑒𝑡′ )=Σ𝑒 (LÜTKEPOHL, 2005)
        However, the reduced form errors are correlated. Only in the special case where there are no
contemporaneous effects among variables (i.e. matrix 𝐴 elements, 𝑎𝑖𝑗 (𝑖 ≠ 𝑗), equals zero) the shocks will be
uncorrelated.
        It is possible, however, to recover the structural VAR coefficients and analyze how 𝑌𝑡 respond to
structural shocks in 𝑢𝑡 , from the estimates of the model in reduced form since, by construction, 𝐴𝑒𝑡 = 𝐵𝑢𝑡 .
Hence, the variance of 𝑒𝑡 is

Σ𝑒 = 𝐴−1 𝐵Σ𝑢 𝐵′𝐴−1′                                                                           (3)

         Σ𝑒 can be consistently estimate from the reduced form by OLS and the system can be solved for the
unknown parameters provided that the number of unknown parameters do not exceed the number of equations.
This involves imposing restrictions on matrix A. Usually, the most common approach is to impose 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 0
restrictions. (KILIAN, 2011)21
         The assumption 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 0 means that yj does not have a contemporaneous effect on yi. The imposition
of different restrictions will result in different impulse response functions depending on the correlation between
errors in the reduced form. Only if all reduced form errors are uncorrelated impulse-response functions will be
the same regardless of the restrictions imposed.

   It is necessary to impose 𝐾(𝐾 + 1)/2 restrictions on both matrices A and B to satisfy order condition. The order condition is
necessary for identification but may not suffice if rank condition fail. Rubio-Ramirez et al. (2010) discuss rank conditions for
identification in SVAR models.

    1.1. Asymmetry

        One possible approach to investigate the existence of asymmetric effects of 𝑥𝑡 on 𝑦𝑡 is to decompose
the variable 𝑥𝑡 into two new series: 𝑥𝑡+ of its positive variations and 𝑥𝑡− , of the negative variations
        Based on Schorderet (2004) and Granger and Yoon (2002) method, a time series can be decomposed
as follows:

𝑥𝑡 = 𝑥0 + 𝑥𝑡+ + 𝑥𝑡−                                                                  (4)

Where

                                     𝜃𝑖 = 1 𝑠𝑒 𝛥𝑥𝑖 > 0,
𝑥𝑡+ = ∑𝑡𝑖=1 𝜃𝑖 (𝛥𝑥𝑖 )       ;    {                                                    (5)
                                       0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒.
                                      ∗
                                     𝜃𝑖 = 1 𝑠𝑒 𝛥𝑥𝑖 < 0,
𝑥𝑡− = ∑𝑡𝑖=1 𝜃𝑖∗ (𝛥𝑥𝑖 )      ;    {                                                   (6)
                                      0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒.

       Such as that, 𝑥𝑡 value, for all t, is equal to its initial value (𝑥0 ) plus the sum of all its positive and
negative variations up to 𝑡.
       In this way, we have first difference of 𝑥𝑡+ and 𝑥𝑡− series:

                                     𝜃𝑖 = 1 𝑠𝑒 𝛥𝑥𝑖 > 0,
𝑑𝑥𝑡+ = 𝜃𝑖 (𝛥𝑥𝑖 )            ;    {                                                   (7)
                                       0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒.
                                      ∗
                                     𝜃𝑖 = 1 𝑠𝑒 𝛥𝑥𝑖 < 0,
𝑑𝑥𝑡− = 𝜃𝑖∗ (𝛥𝑥𝑖 )           ;    {                                                (8)
                                  0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒.
       The decomposition in form (5) and (6) is known in literature as decomposition by cumulative variations
whereas the form in (7) and (8) is known as period-to-period variations.
       Series decomposed by cumulative variations have unit root and cointegrate and are used in the
estimation of error correction models (ECM) and its multivariate form vector error correction (VEC).
       For purpose of this chapter, that estimates a model with the stationary variables in first difference, the
most adequate decomposition, that was used, is the period-to-period decomposition.

    1.2.Exchange Rate Pass-Through

        The exchange rate pass-through can be calculated from impulse response functions estimated by the
SVAR model. This method was used by McCarthy (2007) to calculate the exchange rate pass-through for
several industrialized countries and by Belaisch (2003) and Araújo and Modenesi (2010) for Brazil.

        Where Δ𝐶𝑃𝐼 is consumer price index variations and Δ𝐸𝑅 exchange rate variations.

    1.3.Wald Coefficient Restriction Test

        Wald coefficient restriction tests were performed in asymmetric models to test the hypothesis that the
coefficients relative to exchange rate positive variations are statistically different from the negative variations.
        The test was performed under two different null hypothesis specifications:
                                                                                                                 19
         𝐻0 (A): null hypothesis that the sum of the coefficients of 𝑥 + lags is equal to the sum of the coefficients
of 𝑥 − lags.
         𝐻0 (B): null hypothesis that the lag coefficient i of 𝑦 + is equal to the lag coefficient i of 𝑦 − for all lags.
         To illustrate, generically, a two lags model, SVAR (2), and three variables, 𝑌𝑡 = (𝑦1+ , 𝑦1− , 𝑦2 )′ , where
 +
𝑦1 and 𝑦1− are period-to-period decompositions of 𝑦1
         In reduced form:

𝑌𝑡 = 𝑐0 + Φ1 𝑌𝑡−1 + Φ2 𝑌𝑡−2 + 𝑒𝑡                                                   (10)

        𝑡
          = 𝑐1 𝑦1 +

                                                       𝑡−2
                                                           + 𝑐5 𝑦2 𝑡−1 + 𝑐6 ∆𝑦2 𝑡−2 + 𝑐7

                            𝑡−2
                                + 𝑐10 𝑦1 −
                                         𝑡−1
                                             + 𝑐11 𝑦1 −
                                                      𝑡−2
                                                           + 𝑐12 𝑦2 𝑡−1 + 𝑐13 ∆𝑦2 𝑡−2 + 𝑐14
               +             +            −            −
 𝑦2 𝑡 = 𝑐15 𝑦1 𝑡−1 + 𝑐16 𝑦1 𝑡−2 + 𝑐17 𝑦1 𝑡−1 + 𝑐18 𝑦1 𝑡−2 + 𝑐19 𝑦2 𝑡−1 + 𝑐20 ∆𝑦2 𝑡−2 + 𝑐21

The Wald test was then calculated under 𝐻0 with two different specifications
𝐻0 (A):
                  𝐻0 : 𝑐1 + 𝑐2 = 𝑐3 + 𝑐4 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐8 + 𝑐9 = 𝑐10 + 𝑐11 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐15 + 𝑐16 = 𝑐17 + 𝑐18
𝐻0 (B):
                 𝐻0 : 𝑐1 = 𝑐3 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐2 = 𝑐4 𝑒 𝑐8 = 𝑐10 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐9 = 𝑐11 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐15 = 𝑐17 𝑒 𝑐16 = 𝑐18

         Under 𝐻0 , the Wald statistic is asymptotically distributed as a 𝜒 2 (𝑞), where q is the number of linear
restrictions.
         Wald test statistics reject the null hypothesis that coefficients are equal at conventional significance
levels. Under the null hypothesis A, the test statistic was 8.38 (0.08 p-value). Under the null hypothesis B, test
statistic was 16.57 (0.03 p-value). Therefore, results indicate the existence of asymmetry, that is, that exchange
rate devaluations have different effects on inflation than exchange rate appreciations.
         Table A1 presents Wald tests results. For both specifications, test statistics reject the null hypothesis
that coefficients are equal at conventional significance levels. Therefore, results indicate existence of
asymmetry, i.e. that exchange rate devaluations have different effects on inflation than exchange rate
appreciations.
