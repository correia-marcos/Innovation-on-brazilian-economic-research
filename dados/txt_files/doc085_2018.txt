ABSTRACT
The paper aims to analyze the features of the Brazilian structural change process in the period from 2000 to
2014. More specifically, we investigate the intensity and nature of the deindustrialization process in sub-periods
of the whole period under consideration. To overcome some limitations of the indicators used by the later
literature (the sectoral gross output, value-added and employment shares), we apply an I-O structural
decomposition methodology that takes the effect of relative prices explicitly to examine the contributions of
different factors to the growth of total gross output and its composition. We utilize a series of I-O Matrices
valued at constant prices constructed by the GIC-UFRJ for the period 2000-2014, based on partial information
from the Brazilian SNA and I-O matrix official statistics. Moreover, in our analysis, we regroup the whole set
of extractive and manufacturing sectors into four industry groups according to the classification proposed by
the GIC-UFRJ: processed agricultural commodities, traditional industry, industrial commodities, and innovative
industry. Such classification allows us to interpret some distinctive characteristics of the Brazilian's productive
structure since it captures specific features of the competition and technological flow patterns prevailing in the
Brazilian economy in the period. The I-O structural decomposition analysis of the database described leads us
to develop a different perspective in the debate about the Brazilian deindustrialization process. According to
this perspective, this process is less intense and continuous than literature characterizes it. In particular, we
show that it is more significantly intense in the sub-period after the 2008 world crises and in the case of the
traditional and innovative industries groups.

RESUMO
O artigo tem como objetivo analisar as características do processo de mudança estrutural na economia brasileira
no período de 2000 a 2014. Mais especificamente, investigamos a intensidade e a natureza do processo de
desindustrialização para todo o período e para sub-períodos. Para tanto, examinamos os efeitos da mudança
estrutural nas fontes de mudança estrutural na economia brasileira. Para superar algumas limitações dos
indicadores utilizados pela literatura especializada (valor bruto da produção, valor agregado e ocupações),
aplicamos uma metodologia de decomposição estrutural que considera explicitamente o efeito de preços
relativos para examinar as contribuições de diferentes fatores crescimento da produção bruta total e sua
composição. Utilizamos uma série de Matrizes Insumo-Produto (MIP), nominadas a preços constantes,
construídas pelo GIC-UFRJ para o período 2000-2014, com base em informações parciais das estatísticas
oficiais do Sistema de Contas Nacionais e da MIP. Reagrupamos todo o conjunto de setores extrativista e
manufatureiro em quatro grupos industriais de acordo com a classificação proposta pelo GIC-UFRJ:
commodities agrícolas processadas, indústria tradicional, commodities industriais e indústria inovativa. Tal
classificação permite interpretar algumas características distintivas da estrutura produtiva brasileira, uma vez
que captura os padrões de concorrência e fluxo tecnológico prevalecentes na economia no período. A
decomposição estrutural nos leva a desenvolver uma perspectiva sobre a desindustrialização brasileira, em
especial porque incorpora o efeito dos preços relativos. De acordo com essa perspectiva, esse processo é menos
intenso e contínuo do que a literatura caracteriza. Em particular, mostramos que é mais significativo no
subperíodo após a crise mundial de 2008 e no caso dos setores da indústria tradicional e inovativa.

    STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMY: a structural decomposition analysis for 2000-2014

1 INTRODUCTION

          Since the 2000s, many studies dedicated particular attention to analyzing the evolution of the
productive structure of the Brazilian economy. One of the main topics of discussion is the existence and
intensity of a process of deindustrialization and regressive specialization. Most of this literature uses the
fall in manufacturing industries’, gross output, value added and employment shares as indicators in the
characterization of these processes. However, these indicators have some critical limitations when utilized
for this purpose and cannot be used alone in this type of investigation. We argue that an analysis based on
the indicators gains accuracy by the explicit use of an Input-Output (I-O) analytical framework.
        This paper aims to analyze the process of structural change in the Brazilian economy in the period
between 2000 and 2015. More specifically, our investigation deals with the existence, nature, and intensity
of the processes of deindustrialization and regressive specialization in such a period. To better characterize
these processes, we subdivide the whole period into three subperiods: 2000-2003; 2003-2008; 2010-2014.
Concerning the I-O analytical framework, we specifically apply an I-O structural decomposition
methodology that takes the effect of relative prices explicitly to examine the contributions of different
factors to the growth of total gross output and its composition. In our work, we utilize a series of I-O
Matrices valued at constant prices constructed by GIC-UFRJ for the period 2000-2015, based on partial
information from the Brazilian SNA and I-O matrix official statistics.
        By using this database, it is possible to take into account relative price effects, an essential feature
of the Brazilian and others developing economies. We argue that the exclusion of relative price effect
contributes to the debate about deindustrialization and regressive specialization by increasing the accuracy
of the analysis of the factors affecting the productive structure of the Brazilian economy. Moreover, in our
analysis, we regroup the whole set of extractive and manufacturing sectors into four industry groups
according to the classification proposed by GIC-UFRJ: processed agricultural commodities, traditional
industry, industrial commodities, and innovative industry. Such classification allows us to interpret some
distinctive characteristics of the Brazilian productive structure since it captures specific features of
competition and technological flow patterns prevailing in Brazil.
          Besides this introduction, this paper has more four sections. Section 2 provides an overview of the
Brazilian economy considering a macroeconomic overview and some structural analysis. Section 3
describes methodological issues, as the data, input-output model and structural decomposition. In section 4
we analyze the results of our structural decomposition analysis. Finally, the last section presents some final
remarks.


2   A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE PROCESS OF STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE
    BRAZILIAN ECONOMY

        Two concepts are usually used to understand and characterize the deindustrialization process. First,
we have the classic concept of deindustrialization based on Rowthorn & Wells (1987) among others, that
define deindustrialization as the continuous fall in manufacturing employment share. Secondly, there is the
modern one, suggested by Tregenna (2009) for example, where a country would be deindustrializing if
manufacturing value added share decreases comparing to other sectors, especially the services sector.
           However, there are some criticisms regarding the use of these indicators to characterize
deindustrialization. In using employment as a measure, it is not possible to do sectoral change analysis
regarding production (Silva & Lourenço, 2016). As the standard way to calculate the value added is by the
difference between the gross output and the intermediate inputs, it is also affected by prices and quantities.
Thus, deindustrialization analysis using value added data may be associated only to a change in relative
prices (terms of trade) of the manufacturing industry to the general GDP deflator (Silva & Lourenço, 2016).
                                                                                                             3

           Also, Medeiros, Freitas, & Passoni (2018) discuss that analyzing deindustrialization by the shares
of value added and employment is misleading because they argue that as the economic activity may affect
the participation of manufacturing industries. It happens especially because the investment-output ratio e
pro-cyclical, and the participation of industries intensive in capital goods must rise in the ascendant part of
the cycle and reduce in the valley.
           To overcome those limitations, the authors suggest that the structural change in the economy is
analyzing a combination of three elements. The first one is the comparison of value added (and
employment) of innovative industry group n total value added (and employment). The second one analyzes
competitive indicators such as market share of domestic exports on world exports by industry and the
market share of imports in total supply. The last one is the density of the interindustry relations as captured
by the input-output linkages indicators.
           This work concentrates its analysis on the last point, using the input-output approach. Some
studies use input-output indicators to analyze the existence of structural change of the Brazilian economy.
Most of this studies use Rasmussen linkage indicators and key sectors to verify if there are changes in the
backward and forward linkages. Some of them are Morceiro (2012), Pires, Teixeira and, Rocha (2015),
Marconi, Rocha, & Magacho (2016). The first three ones concentrate their analysis up to 2009 because
there was a change in the national system accounts that realized only in 2016 the input-output table (IBGE,
2016). They found that there was a was a reduction in technical coefficients, not only for the manufacturing
industry but also for all economic sectors. Also, a common result is that although the manufacturing
industry is reducing its linkages in the economy, this sector continues to be very important because they
have high linkage effects, having the capability to stimulate other sectors.
           For a more recent period, Passoni & Freitas (2017) shows that between 2010 and 2014 the
manufacturing activities are still very important to the productive structure, but this important is more
significant in the traditional industry. Also, they show based on the power and sensitivity of dispersion
indicators and its composition there was no significant change in the Brazilian economy between 2010 and
2014. Medeiros, Freitas and, Passoni (2018) analyze these linkage indicators between a larger period, 2000
and 2014, but focused on the innovative industry. They show that there were small changes between 2000
and 2014, but exists an increasing tendency between 2000 and 2008 and a declining trend in the period
from 2010 to 2014.
        Structural decomposition analysis (SDA) is also another input-output methodology used to identify
the structural change in the Brazilian economy. Neves (2013), Persona and Oliveira (2016) and Magacho,
McCombie and Guilhoto (2018) use this methodology with the objective to verify the hypothesis of
deindustrialization and regressive specialization. Because of the structural data availability, this studies
analysis the Brazilian economy up to 2009. They use different databases and methods to construct a deflated
IOT series. They use cell-specific deflators, double deflation, and accumulated quantum indices
respectively.
          All three works argue that the final demand is the source of change that contributes the most to the
changes in gross output in the period. Persona & Oliveira (2016) found out that technological change
(changes on national technical coefficients) had a negative influence on employment (more expressively),
value added, gross product and growth. The authors associate this change with technological innovation,
changes in products composition, changes in relative prices and trade pattern. As this study ended in 2009,
this must also be an effect of the negative performance in the Brazilian economy at this time. According to
them, the hypothesis of regressive specialization is correct, as changes of gross output and value added
were related to industries based on natural resources and reduction of manufacturing sectors intensive in
scale and technology importance.
          Neves (2013) argues that there is not strong evidence of a marked process of deindustrialization
between 2000 and 2008, whether from the perspective of occupations or under the gross output. The author
bases his argument on the idea that the manufacturing industry had the greatest contribution among all
industries. However, as far as the trade pattern is concerned, there is import penetration in the manufacturing
industry, especially more marked in the medium-low and medium-high technology sectors. In addition,
                                                                                                               4

there is a negative contribution of the technological change to the gross output in volume in the period,
which is mitigated by the change in relative prices.
          Magacho, McCombie and Guilhoto (2018) found that the technological change had a positive
effect on the period, but the substitution of national inputs mitigate its result. The results suggest that there
is a penetration of imported inputs, and this is essential to understand the Brazilian growth in the period
analyzed. In a sectoral perspective, the authors observe that substitution of national inputs is more
pronounced in high- and medium-high-technology manufacturing sectors.
        Although Persona and Oliveira (2016) and Magacho, McCombie, and Guilhoto (2018) deflate the
IOT to consider the effects of the exchange rates’ volatility and relative price changes and analyze prices
effect and quantity separately, we argue that both methods is not enough to include with relative prices
changes in the structural decomposition analysis. In both methods, there is a missing step that must consider
the deflator in each sector concerning the total gross output. This step guarantees the additivity over
industries because there are changes in the relation of both deflators. Besides that, these studies do not
include the role of relative prices inside the SDA explicitly.
        Neves (2013) overcome those limitations and construct a database that guarantees the additivity
over industries and include the role of relative prices inside the SDA. Besides that, the way the author
analyzes the role of relative prices is not the most accurate one once he analysis each effect separately. The
role of relative prices has it meaning when analyzed in a global way inside the decomposition.
        In other to overcome this limitation, the novelty of this work is to present an SDA analysis that
disentangles the changes in gross output in its volume changes and relative prices properly. Also, a new
feature is that we use a more recent database that covers 15 years (2000-2014) that allow us to understand
what happened in the Brazilian productive structure after 2009. We argue that the process of
deindustrialization have to have its focus those sectors that have the innovation capacity, primarily because
it stimulates technological flows.

3 METHODOLOGY

3.1   Data and aggregation

       We utilize a series of I-O Matrices valued at relative constant prices of 2010, constructed by the GIC-
UFRJ for the period 2000-2015. The I-O matrices at current and prices of the previous year is constructed
based on partial information from the Brazilian SNA and I-O matrix official statistics (IBGE, 2015; 2016),
published by Passoni and Freitas (2018a; 2018b).
       Since our goal is to include the relative prices change in the context of SDA in the Brazilian case, we
use also I-O tables valued at constant relative prices, as proposed in Casler (2006), Dietzenbacher and
Temurshoev (2012), Hillinger (2002) and Reich (2008) and constructed by (Passoni & Freitas, 2018b).
       In the procedure done by Passoni and Freitas (2018b), they deflate the whole series of estimated
matrices at current and last year prices by the price index of total gross-output. Using this data is possible
to isolate the contribution of relative price changes. For that chained prices indices were constructed using
cell-specific deflators to put all the I-O Tables at the base year, in this case, 2010. At the decomposition we
present in this work, this data is related to what we will call ‘volume effect,' that expresses the change in
production of the specific good or service in question. In this way, they purge the inflation effect and the
IOT a series that Passoni and Freitas (2018b) presents is compatible over time.
            To obtain deflated IOT additivity another step is necessary. Passoni and Freitas (2018b) also
adjusted the previous series for relative prices to obtain a series at constant relative prices, as suggested by
Balk & Reich, 2008; Dietzenbacher & Temurshoev, 2012; Diewert, 2015; Reich, 2008. They make this
adjustment though dividing each relative price (cell-specific deflators) by the total gross output deflator. It
guarantees consistent deflated input-output tables. This step allows isolation of the variation of one
commodity price relative to the other commodities, caused by the forces of supply and demand on each
commodity market. So, we will name this price adjustment as ‘relative prices effect.'
                                                                                                           5

         We observe that relative price changes have a meaningful impact when doing sectoral analysis in
the period analyzed in this study. Although, most of the studies of the Brazilian process of
deindustrialization do not analyze this aspect, and this may influence the observed results.
      Relative to the data used, the decomposition procedures were calculated based on 91 commodities by
42 sectors. This disaggregation level is the most disaggregated data possible for an IOT large series of
Brazilian national accounts1 For organization and disclosure of results, we regroup the whole set of
extractive and manufacturing sectors into four industry groups according to the classification proposed by
GIC-UFRJ
  • Processed agricultural commodities (PAC): sectors intensive in natural and energy resources, being
      generally associated with agribusiness and homogeneous products of high tonnage;
  • Industrial Commodities (IC): natural resource intensive activities related to mineral extractive
      industry, metallurgy and basic chemistry;
   • Traditional industry (IT): industries that produce goods with less technological content, with few
      requirements regarding productive scale; production of wage goods, inputs, industrial parts and
      complements, and manufactured consumer goods;
   • Innovative industry (IN): more sophisticated activities in technology and organization terms on the
      production process that most contribute to the technology diffusion process in the economy;

The description of the sectors that contain this classification is in the appendix.
       As suggested by Medeiros, Freitas, & Passoni (2018), this classification is better than others based
only on the technological intensity of products (such as OECD intensity classification). It captures supply
factors, such as the global pattern of competition and technological flow and also aspects related to demand,
as the technological intensity of demanding manufacturing and extractive goods. Such classification allows
us to interpret some distinctive characteristics of the Brazilian productive structure and has essential
meaning when analyzing the process of deindustrialization.

3.2      I-O model in the context of relative prices

        The gross output (𝐱) in the I-O model is:
                                           𝐱 = (𝐈 − 𝐀 𝐧 )−𝟏 𝐟𝐧                                          (1)
                                                                        (𝐈      ) −𝟏 (𝑛
where 𝐀 𝐧 (𝑛 × 𝑛) is the matrix of domestic technical coefficients; − 𝐀 𝐧               × 𝑛) is the Inverse
Leontief Matrix, and 𝐟𝐧 is the domestic final demand (𝑛 × 1), and n is the number of sectors in the model.
        In the Brazilian IOT 𝐀 𝐧 and 𝐟𝐧 are obtained from the Use Table of national products at basic prices,
which contains the information of intermediate demand of commodities by sector and final demand of
commodities (𝑛 × 𝑘, with k commodities). To transform this information according to the industry
technology model we use a market share matrix (𝐃) to transform demand of commodities into the demand
of sectors. This matrix is defined as follows:
                                                𝐃 = 𝐕𝐪̂                                                (2)
where 𝐕 is the transposed matrix production (𝑛 × 𝑘) and 𝐪 the gross output value by commodity (𝑘 × 1).
        Let 𝐔𝐧 be the flow matrix of intermediate demand for national products at basic prices. Thus, we
obtain the commodity by sector matrix of national technical coefficients 𝐁𝐧 , as follows:
                                             𝐁𝐧 = 𝐔𝐧 𝐱̂ −𝟏                                             (3).
Next, by premultiplying 𝐁𝐧 by 𝐃 we obtain 𝐀 𝐧 :
                                              𝐀 𝐧 = 𝐃. 𝐁𝐧                                              (4).
Likewise, we obtain the vector of final demand by sector (𝐟𝐧 ) by premultiplying the vector of final demand
by commodities (𝐝𝐅𝐧 ) by 𝐃 such as:
                                             𝐟𝐧 = 𝐃. (𝐝𝐅𝐧 )                                             (5).

                                                                                                                6

Using (4) and (5) we present gross output as:
                                            𝐱 = 𝐃. 𝐁𝐧 𝐱 + 𝐃. 𝐝𝐅𝐧                                          (6).
           We can express sectoral gross output as follows, to capture the changes in volume and prices,
                                                   𝐱 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱𝐯                                            (7)
        𝐩
with 𝐱̂ represents the relative price effect and 𝐱𝐯 is gross output volume. The changes in the prices here
represents the relative price effect, mentioned in the previous section, and we define 𝐱̂ 𝐩 = 𝑥𝑗𝑝 ⁄𝑝, where 𝑥𝑗𝑝
is the price index of the sector j and 𝑝 the price index of total gross output deflator.
                As we aim to capture the influence of relative prices in the IO model components, we rewrite
all variables disaggregating relative price and volume terms. The elements of the 𝐔𝐧 matrix becomes:
                                                        𝑢𝑛 𝑝𝑖𝑗                                           (8)
                                             𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑗 =            × 𝑢𝑛 𝑣𝑖𝑗
                                                          𝑝
           𝑝
Where 𝑢𝑛 𝑖𝑗 is the relative price of commodity i used as an input by industry j, and 𝑢𝑛 𝑣𝑖𝑗 is the volume
measure of commodity i used as an input by industry j.
         Using (7) and (8) in (3) , the elements of 𝐁𝐧 are given by:
                                            𝑢𝑛 𝑝𝑖𝑗                                                      (9).
                                                            𝑣        𝑝            𝑣
                                              𝑝         𝑢 𝑛 𝑖𝑗    𝑢𝑛 𝑖𝑗      𝑢  𝑛 𝑖𝑗
                                    𝑏𝑛𝑖𝑗 = 𝑝 × 𝑣 =                      × 𝑣
                                             𝑥𝑗          𝑥𝑗       𝑝𝑥 𝑗         𝑥𝑗

                                             𝐩
Let us define the elements of matrices 𝐁𝐧 = [𝑏𝑛 𝑝𝑖𝑗 ] and 𝐁𝐧𝐯 = [𝑏𝑛 𝑣𝑖𝑗 ] as follows:

Thus, using the symbol ⊗ to denote the Hadamard product, the 𝐁𝐧 matrix can be expressed in the following
way:
                                               𝐩
                                         𝐁𝐧 = 𝐁𝐧 ⊗ 𝐁𝐧𝐯                                              (11)

         𝐩
where, 𝐁𝐧 is the matrix of relative price indices, and 𝐁𝐧𝐯 is the matrix of national technical coefficients
measured in volume terms, both related to the commodity by industry national technical coefficient matrix.
          As to the final demand, let us define the commodity relative price of the final demand vector
   𝐩
(𝐝𝐅𝐧 ):
                                               𝐩
                                              𝐝𝐅𝐧 = 𝑑𝐹𝑝𝑛𝑗 /𝑝                                            (12).
Next, we can decompose the final demand vector in its relative price and volume components, obtaining
the expression below:
                                                      𝐩
                                              𝐝𝐅𝐧 = 𝐝𝐅𝐧 𝐝𝐯𝐅𝐧                                            (13)
           𝐯
where 𝐝𝐅𝐧 represents the volume final demand vector.
        Finally, for the market-share matrix, the approach was somewhat different. First, the volume market
share (𝐃𝐯 ) was calculated using constant prices data:
                                                        ̂𝐯
                                               𝐃𝐯 = 𝐕 𝐯 𝐪                                              (14).
                                                                    𝐩
        Since there is not a direct relative prices deflator to D (𝐃 ) that guarantees consistent aggregation,
we calculate it by the cell-by-cell Hadamard division (⊘) of market share matrix calculated using constant
relative prices data (𝐃) and constant relative prices data (𝐃𝐯 ).
                                             𝐃𝐩 = 𝐃 ⊘ 𝐃𝐯                                               (15).

Doing so, we represent D as:
                                        𝐃 = 𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯                                                     (16).
       Back to equation (6), we have now:
                                           𝐩                                 𝐩
                    𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱𝐯 = (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯 )(𝐁𝐧 ⊗ 𝐁𝐧𝐯 )𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱𝐯 + (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯 ). (𝐝𝐅𝐧 𝐝𝐯𝐅𝐧 )                     (17)
                                                                                                                      7

Solving the last equation for the vector of gross output in volume terms we obtain
                                              𝐩               −𝟏                     𝐩                        (18).
            𝐱𝐯 = [𝐈 − (𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯 )(𝐁𝐧 ⊗ 𝐁𝐧𝐯 )𝐱̂ 𝐩 )] 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯 ). (𝐝𝐅𝐧 𝐝𝐯𝐅𝐧 )
To simplify the above equation, we denote 𝐀                                                        ̃ 𝐧 ]−𝟏, and 𝐟̃𝐧 =
                                               ̃ 𝐧 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯 )(𝐁𝐧𝐩 ⊗ 𝐁𝐧𝐯 )𝐱̂ 𝐩, 𝐙̃ = [𝐈 − 𝐀

vector weighted by total relative prices. In this way,
                                        𝐱𝐯 = (𝐈 − 𝐀̃ )−𝟏 𝐟̃ = 𝐙̃𝐟̃

                                                                                                              (19).

       This equation is interesting because it allows us to identify the volume contribution to changes in
gross output (the volume effect), leaving aside the relative price contribution.


3.3   A proposed indicator of the share of industries in gross output

       Before doing the decomposition itself, we propose an indicator that compares the sectoral growth
share of each industry group with the total economy. With this, we can see if each industry is growing
above or below the total gross output. Notably, we are interested in analyzing the performance of the
innovative industry group concerning the economy, as it is the industry that can stimulate technological
flow in the economy.
       If we consider 𝜏 as the share of each extractive and manufacturing industry group (𝑥𝐺𝑣 ) in the total
gross output volume (𝑥 𝑣 ), as in:
                                                   𝑥𝐺𝑣                                               (20)
                                              𝜏= 𝑣
                                                   𝑥
with 𝐺 as industrial commodities, processed agricultural commodities, traditional industry and innovative
industry.
       We can measure the growth rate of 𝜏 (𝑔𝜏 ) using the growth rates of 𝑥𝐺𝑣 and 𝑥 𝑣 :
                                             𝑣    𝑣
                                           𝑥𝐺  −𝑥𝐺             𝑥 𝑣 −𝑥 𝑣                            (21)
                                     𝑔𝑥𝐺𝑣 = 1𝑥 𝑣 0 and 𝑔𝑥 𝑣 = 1𝑥 𝑣 0
                                                    𝐺0                   0
in this way:
                                                    𝑔𝑥𝐺𝑣 − 𝑔𝑥 𝑣                                               (22).
                                             𝑔𝜏 =
                                                     1 + 𝑔𝑥 𝑣
If 𝑔𝜏 < 1 it means that the group growth rate is lower than the total gross output in volume. In this sense,
it contributes to the decline in the share and will indicate that the participation of each group is falling in
the period. The previous equations (34), (35) and (36) are also calculated using the total gross output. The
comparison between them also gives the importance of taking apart the relative price effect.

3.4   Structural decomposition

         The structural decomposition analysis (SDA) approach is a technique that disaggregates the change
of some economic aspect into various components contributions - disaggregating an identity into several
components (Miller & Blair, 2009). Any economic variable can be decomposed into its elements, enabling
a better understanding of the variation between two periods.
         The variable of interest, in this paper, is the change in Brazilian gross output (𝐱) between 2000 and
2015, and three subperiods: 2000-2003, 2003-2008 and 2010-2015. With it, we propose a two-level
decomposition. The first one disaggregates the change of gross output presented in equation (7) in changes
in total volume (𝐱𝐯 ) and total relative prices (𝐱 𝐩 ).
                                                                                                                     8

         The decomposition follows Dietzenbacher & Los (1998) and Miller & Blair (2009), using the
average of the two extreme decomposition situations. Denote '0' and '1' as superscripts for the initial and
final, respectively. So, the gross output change (𝚫𝐱) of equation (7), then, becomes:
                                                   𝐩            𝐩
                                           𝚫𝐱 = 𝐱̂ 𝟏 𝐱̂ 𝟏𝐯 − 𝐱̂ 𝟎 𝐱̂ 𝟎𝐯                               (23)
                                            𝟏 𝐩            𝐩            𝟏                             (24)

                                ⏟          = (𝐱̂ 𝟏 + 𝐱̂ 𝟎 )𝚫𝐱𝐯 + 𝚫𝐱̂ 𝐩 (𝐱̂ 𝟏𝐯 + 𝐱̂ 𝟎𝐯 )
                        𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒈𝒓𝒐𝒔𝒔 𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒑𝒖𝒕
                                            ⏟
                                            𝟐                           ⏟
                                                                        𝟐
                              𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒆            𝒗𝒐𝒍𝒖𝒎𝒆 𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒆         𝒓𝒆𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒑𝒓𝒊𝒄𝒆𝒔
                                                                         𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒆𝒔
We express all the decomposition's results regarding its contribution to total gross output growth. To obtain
this contribution, we must divide each variable in (19) concerning initial gross output 𝑥0 .
        For its turn, the second level decomposition departs from changes of total volume (𝐱𝐯 ).

        In this second level, we separate volume contribution from the relative prices contribution to 𝐱𝐯
growth. The volume contribution corresponds to the variation of volume variables 𝐃𝐯 , 𝐁𝐧𝐯 , and, 𝐝𝐯𝐅𝐧 . The
                                                         𝐩        𝐩
price contribution corresponds to the changes in 𝐱̂ 𝐩 , 𝐁𝐧 , and 𝐝𝐅𝐧 .
        To this decomposition, we apply the difference between all the variables at the final and at the initial
point in (17) to find 𝚫𝐱𝐯 and its volume and price effect contribution. So, we have:
                                            𝚫𝐱𝐯 = 𝚫(𝐙̃𝐟̃𝐧 )                                              (25)
        After the methodological procedures, presented in the appendix, the structural decomposition results
in the following equation:
                                                                                                         (26)
                       𝐯       ̆ 𝐯   ̆ 𝐯  ̆ 𝐯           ̆𝐩     ̆𝐩      ̆ 𝐩 ̆ 𝐩
                    𝚫𝐱 = [ ⏟ (𝐀 𝐧 + 𝐟𝐧 + 𝐃 ) + ⏟       (𝐱 + 𝐀 𝐧 + 𝐟𝐧 + 𝐃 ) + 𝒔̆]
                             𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝛖)   𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (𝛒)
where […  ̆] represents the changes between the final and initial period inside the 𝚫𝐱𝐯 for each variable
assigned. At this point, we define 𝐟𝐧 as being the final demand excluded inventories (𝒔). We do this because
inventories do not have economic meaning as it used as a residual account on SNA. To obtain the
contribution to gross output, we must divide each variable in (21) concerning initial gross output 𝑥0 .
         So, the volume contribution is the sum of the volume changes in the national intermediate demand
̆𝐯𝐧 , the final demand 𝐟̆𝐧𝐯 and the market share contribution 𝐃
𝐀                                                                   ̆ 𝐯 . The price contribution takes into account the
effect of total relative prices, the change in the relative prices inside national intermediate inputs
coefficients, final demand and market share matrix.
         We must notice that 𝐀        ̆𝐩𝐧 and 𝐟̆𝐧𝐯 /𝐟̆𝐧𝐩 contributions, in fact, represents the change in 𝐁𝐧𝐯 /𝐁𝐧𝐩 and
                                 ̆𝐯𝐧 /𝐀
        𝐩                                                                  ̆ 𝐩 we include the changes of the volume
                                                                      ̆ 𝐯 /𝐃
𝐝𝐯𝐅𝐧 /𝐝𝐅𝐧 , but weighted by the market share matrix. Inside 𝐃
market share matrix, weighted by 𝐀 𝐧 and 𝐟𝐧 . We present the equations definitions in the Appendix.

    •   Volume contribution (𝜐) and sources of change

        All the previous procedure was done to isolate the changes in the Brazilian gross output related to
volume.
        In this section, we analyze the volume contribution to gross output in volume, expressed at (26). In
other to better identify the factors that contribute to changes in output, we propose the following sources of
change: trade pattern, technological change, and final demand. The changes in the trade pattern reflect the
effect of penetration/substation of inputs or final goods and services. The technological change's
contribution shows the consequence of a change in the `production recipe´. The last factor is the final
demand's contribution that displays the effect of the variations of final demand in the gross output.
        To capture all these effects, we express all national variables in total demand and imported demand.
The changes in matrix 𝐀 𝐧 is due to variations in the technology itself (𝐀) or also on the trade pattern of
imported inputs, we calculate national technological coefficients as a difference between total technical
coefficients (𝐀) and imported technical coefficients (𝐀 𝐦 ), as:
                                                                                                                9

                                              𝐀𝐧 = 𝐀 − 𝐀𝐦                                                 (27).
As observed in (10) and (11), 𝐀 and 𝐀 𝐦 are:
                                    𝐀 = (𝐃𝐩 ⊗ 𝐃𝐯 ). (𝐁 𝐩 ⊗ 𝐁 𝐯 )                                          (28)
                                               𝐩     𝐯     𝐩       𝐯
                                  𝐀 𝐦 = (𝐃 ⊗ 𝐃 ). (𝐁𝐦 ⊗ 𝐁𝐦 )                                              (29).
        In this sense, variations in 𝐀 will express the contribution to technological change, and the
contribution of 𝐀 𝐦 shows the changes in the trade pattern of inputs in the Brazilian economy. Note that as
Brazilian SNA express the inputs information in a commodity-by-sector level, we observe these changes
in 𝐁 and 𝐁𝐦 changes.
        However, the change in the technology itself may demand more imported inputs than was previously
necessary. An increase/decrease in total imports this way may not be related to a change in trade pattern,
such as penetration or substation of imports, but only reflects the technological needs for production. To
isolate this effect, as Schuschny (2005) and Kupfer, Freitas, & Young (2003) propose, we estimate an
auxiliary matrix of imported technological coefficients.
                                                                                  𝐯
        The basic idea of this hypothesis is disaggregating the changes in 𝐁𝐦       that are influenced by the
changes in the technology and the one which is due exclusively to the trade pattern. As technological
requirements are better analyzed considering only the volume, we calculate this auxiliary matrix of
imported technological coefficients (𝐁̌𝐦𝐯
                                           ) supposing that it grows proportionally based on the rate of growth

To obtain the contribution to gross output, we must divide each variable in (31) to initial gross output 𝑥0 .
        The changes in technology are related to column-specific changes, as a simplification (Miller &
Blair, 2009). As each column of 𝐀 shows the way of production of each sector (the ‘sector's production
recipe'), the change column by column extracts the effect of input changes in each sector of the economy.
So, this changes in technological coefficients will show the changes in input needs for the production in
each sector. It is related to the ‘fabrication effect,' and determinate the type of inputs that the production of
each sector depends on the most (i.e., if the technology depends more intensive in high-technologic or
labor-skilled inputs).
        This way of rearranging the information allows characterizing the changes in the Brazilian economy
structure. Figure 4 shows an alternative form to visualize the decompositions.

         Although the decomposition is done to total gross output (𝚫𝐱) and 𝚫𝐱𝐯 , only the volume
contribution to 𝚫𝐱𝐯 (highlighted in Figure 4) is going to be analyzed on the following section with the
results.
         One way to present decomposition is as the rate of growth of gross output, after normalizing
(dividing) by the total initial gross output. In this case, we must have to pre-multiply volume (υ) and price
contribution (𝜌) by sectoral relative prices. This step is necessary for the proper aggregation between
sectors. After this, it is possible to normalize to obtain the sectoral growth's contribution. The following
section presents results of these decompositions.

4 RESULTS

       Before presenting the decomposition itself, we present the manufacturing and extractive industries
share on total gross output in Figure 5. We present two different share series one Total (TOT), related to 𝐱,
and other in volume (VOL), corresponds to 𝐱𝐯 . This figure helps us to visualize the benefits of
desegregating volume and relative prices.
       As can be seen on the graph, it is possible to observe the relative price effect by the difference
between bold (VOL) and dotted (TOT) line.
       The industries TI and IC have more changes in their relative prices among the periods. This change
usually increases their participation in total gross output. This graph also indicates that the process of
                                                                                                                   11

deindustrialization in Brazil is less intense and continuous as literature characterize it, due to relative price
effects. The reduction of these industries share on gross output may be associated with other questions than
deindustrialization itself, i.e., by the economic performance.

       Analyzing the growth rate of IN volume’s share as presented in Table 1, we see that its participation
had positive growth during 2000-2014 and 2003-2008. In both periods, this extractive and manufacturing
group was the only one that its growth was higher than the gross output in volume. The weak economic
performance in 2000-2003 is maybe the cause of the negative growth of the share of this industry group.
These both facts are connected with the relationship between investment-output ratio and its connection
with the macroeconomic performance of the economy.

        The positive growth share of IN in 2003-2008 and 2000-2014 happened because there was an
increase in the investment-output ratio in these periods (MEDEIROS, FREITAS, PASSONI, 2018), that
lead new productive capacity and new investments. Comparing what happened in 2000-2014 and 2010-
2014, with an IN annual volume contribution to total gross output of 2.98pp and 3.06pp (Table 2) and gross
output growth of 2.85% and 2.33%, what must justify the growth of all industries groups, but especially the
innovative industry is the reduction of its importance in the Brazilian economy. As mentioned by Medeiros,
Freitas, and Passoni (2018), there was a declining trend of backward and forward linkages in the Brazilian
economy between 2010 and 2014.
        Table 1 also helps us to visualize the importance of taking the relative prices apart from the analysis
of deindustrialization. Analyzing the same indicator for the total share, we see the share of the industries
increasing in the periods. The difference between them shows the effect of the changes in relative prices,
                                                                                                                                 12

that is more pronounced with the IC and PAC, but also by the opposite sign and magnitude in the innovative
industry.
        Both previous helps to see the importance of relative prices on structural analysis, and its importance
in a more explicit way if we see when analyzing the growth. By doing the decomposition analysis, is
possible to verify if the changes on gross output are due to reasons that the literature generally associates
with deindustrialization, as the loss of competitiveness of the domestic market, seen by trade pattern, or by
the economic deceleration.
        In Table 2 we see the decomposition analysis for 2000 and 2014 and selected periods, for the whole
economy. The first level of the decomposition disaggregates the total gross output change (A) in the volume
effect (B) and Relative price effect (C). The relative price effect’s contribution is very low for the aggregate,
but for a sectoral analysis, its importance is more apparent.

        The second level disaggregation is for the volume effect (B), disaggregated in the volume
contribution (D), relative prices contribution (E) and inventories. The relative prices contribution has a
substantial effect not only at the disaggregated level but also in the aggregate one. It usually tends to
underestimate the volume contribution or the changes due to real factors. As mentioned at the methodology,
only the volume contribution (D) to gross output in volume is going to be analyzed the results.
        Table 3 is presented the volume contribution to gross output in a sectoral perspective, and also for
the aggregate. Among all subperiods, 2003-2008 had the highest accumulated volume contribution, due to
the intense period's economic activity. We can explain this performance by favorable external conditions
and an active internal macroeconomic policy, founded on the growth of public expenditures (consumption
and investment) and credit expansion for household’s consumption and investment (Serrano & Summa,
2012). Also, there was an improvement in the labor market and gains in real wages, and with inflation was
under control, and there was an improvement in income distribution and poverty indicators.
        The most important source of change to volume contribution in all subperiods is the final demand.
The domestic demand represents the higher participation on final’s demand contribution, except for 2000-
2003. The external demand was significant in this period because Brazilian economic activity was very
week due the high-interest rates adopted after the balance-of-payments crisis and presented a depreciation
of exchange rate.
        When analyzing the disaggregated data, we see that IC and TI ins the ones that contributed the most
to the external demand (0.08pp and 0.06pp). A fact that helps us to understand it is the share of exports of
IC increased its share in total Brazilian exports (9%) and also in world’s market (40%) at 2000-2003
(MEDEIROS, FREITAS, PASSONI, 2018). In the case of TI, although it has a significant contribution
(0.06pp), the share of exports in total national exports (-5%) and the world’s exports (-12%) fallen this
period. It indicates that besides this decline, this sector for this period is also significant to gross output.
     The technological change due to the variation of national technical coefficients had a positive impact
in 2000-2014 and 2010-2014. This effect is more marked in the Services, although IC also has significant
participation. In 2010-2014 the proportion of this effect (at about 30% of total volume contribution) was
the higher among all periods and had the higher annual contribution (0.51pp).

The effect of non-competitive imports is minimal in almost all periods, and for 2000-2014 and 2010-2014
they were negative (-0.03pp and -0.14pp).
     In 2000-2003, the total technological change had a negative contribution of 0.05pp. This effect is
probably related to the effects of trade liberalization that took place in the 1990's and still had an impact on
this period. Also, we can see this adverse effect is common in a sectoral perspective. In 2003-2008 we also
saw a negative contribution of technological change, but its sectoral composition is different. All extractive
and manufacturing sectors had a negative contribution to the total gross output, indicating that the ‘recipe
of production’ contributes in a negative way for the gross output.
     There is penetration of imports on intermediate inputs in total market supply for all subperiods. It
represents a loss of competitiveness of national market against the imported suppliers. Also, this effect is
more marked in the ones where the economic growth is higher, like 2000-2014 (-0.37pp) and 2003-2008 (-
0.84pp). Besides that, is in 2000-2003 that this effect represents the higher proportion among all sources of
change, representing almost -30% of 0.24pp. These may be in function of the low economic dynamic in
this subperiod.
     Also, we see the process of penetration of imports in the final demand. This fact is common among
almost all sub-periods, except for 2000-2003 where there is a substitution of imported for national goods
supply. We attribute this different pattern to exchange rate depreciation, and also to the weak performance
in the economy.
     In a sectoral level, there is penetration of imports for intermediate inputs and final demand for most
sectors in 2000-2014, 2000-2003 and 2003-2008 for all industries groups. Besides that, some sectors have
their penetration of imports higher in intermediate demand than in the final demand. These sectors are IC
and Services. The opposite to this happens with TI (more concentrated in consumption) and IN
                                                                                                             14

(concentrated in GFCF), where the final demand penetration is higher. In 2000-2014, the IN was the one
which had the higher penetration of imports between extractive and manufacturing industries, and in its
case, this happened in a more significant proportion because final goods (-0.09pp compared to -0.04pp of
intermediate inputs).
     In 2003-2008 we can say that there is a substantial effect of penetration of imports in consumption and
GFCF, with a negative contribution of -0.40pp and -0.32pp. In 2010-2014 we visualized that the effect of
weak economic activity leads to a null contribution of this effect for gross fixed capital formation. This fact
is different in general from other sectors, which generally had their penetration of imports of intermediate
inputs higher than final demand. It happens because there is a dependency on imported final goods, such
as machinery and equipment.

5 FINAL REMARKS

         This paper contributes to the debate of deindustrialization because it considers explicitly the role of
relative price effects and how it affects this debate. We showed that taking apart relative prices effects
guarantee accuracy on results. Also, the proposed I-O structural decomposition analysis is an alternative
way to see the changes in the Brazilian productive structure. As well we use a new database that allows us
to contribute with more recent information.
         The hypothesis of the process of regressive specialization may be affected by relative prices.
Relative price effect has an impact on IC, mainly because of the rising tendency of international
commodities prices that started in 2003 and intensified in the following year (Lima e Silva, Prado, &
Torracca, 2016). Without taking apart the effects of relative prices, it generally influences in a positivity
way its contribution to output growth. So, if analyzed the total effect, its participation on gross output is
overestimated.
         Among all manufacturing industries, when disaggregated the contribution to volume effect is
considered, the Traditional and Innovative industry's final demand are the industries which had importance
on the period of high growth. It happens because there is a positive relationship between the trend rate of
GDP growth and the investment-output ratio.
         So, when there is economic growth (deceleration) the participation of manufacturing industries may
rise (follow) because there is an increase (decrease) demand for manufacturing products (capital goods). In
periods of weak growth, the positive disaggregated gross output in volume growth is generally due to
services sectors, that contraposes the weak manufacturing and extractive performance.
         According to this perspective, such deindustrialization process is less intense and continuous than
it is usually characterized in the literature when considering relative prices effect and analyzing the volume
change in volume gross contributions in a broader perspective.
         Besides that, we see that something happened before 2010, that even with a considerable average
of growth, the innovative industry has grown on a low path compared to the total gross output in volume.
This is also seen by other authors, like Medeiros, Freitas, and Passoni (2018) and must indicate that there
is some evidence that these industry group is losing its capacity to stimulate the economy. Also, another
fact that may justify this fact is that is the reasons that explain the economic growth in the period, not
marked by the trajectory of GFCF.
         Also, the intense process of penetration of imports on market’s inputs and final goods demand is
not favorable for the Brazilian economy. This seems recurrently by all periods, just changing its intensity
because of the economic activity. These are some preliminary results, and a more in-depth analysis
considering the sources of capital goods in the GFCF may contribute to understanding the role of investment
and the innovative industry for the productive structure.

I-O model on the context of relative prices

          To solve the I-O model on the context of relative prices, we substitute we part form the following equation:
                                                                  𝐱 = 𝐀𝐧 𝐱 + 𝐟𝐧
By doing the substitution of 𝐱 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱𝐯 we have:
                                                            𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱𝐯 = 𝐀𝐧 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱𝐯 + 𝐟𝐧
Solving for 𝐱 by premultiplying the previous equation for 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏
               𝐯

                                                𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱 𝐯 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐀𝐧 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱𝐯 + 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐟𝐧
                                                      𝐱𝐯 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐀𝐧 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐱𝐯 + 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐟𝐧
                                                   ∗
To simplify the previous equation, we define 𝐀𝐧 = 𝐀𝐧 𝐱̂ 𝐩
                                                        𝐱𝐯 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐀∗𝐧 𝐱𝐯 + 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐟𝐧
                   −𝟏                 −𝟏
          ̃𝐧 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐀∗𝐧 and 𝐟̃𝐧 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝐟𝐧 . So, we have:
and also 𝐀
                                                                 𝐱𝐯 = 𝐀 ̃𝐧 𝐱𝐯 + 𝐟̃𝐧
                                           −𝟏
               v           𝐯
Solving for x , we have: 𝐱 = (𝐈 − 𝐀    ̃𝐧 ) 𝐟̃𝐧, where 𝐙̃ = (𝐈 − 𝐀       ̃𝐧 )−𝟏 is the Leontief matrix taking account relative prices
effect In this way we can express the gross output in volume as: 𝐱𝐯 = 𝐙̃𝐟̃𝐧

Structural decomposition

We find the changes in the gross output in volume between the final and initial period in the following way:
                                                      𝚫𝐱𝐯 = 𝐱 𝐯𝟏 − 𝐱𝐯𝟎
                                                      𝚫𝐱𝐯 = 𝚫(𝐙̃𝐟̃𝐧 )
                                                                                                                                              17

As suggested by Dietzenbacher & Los (1998) and Miller & Blair (2009), we calculate the decomposition of the previous
equation by the mean of the two extreme cases:
                                                 𝟏                     𝟏
                                          𝚫𝐱𝐯 = 𝚫𝐙̃(𝐟̃𝐧 𝟏 + 𝐟̃𝐧 𝟎 ) + (𝐙̃𝟏 + 𝐙̃𝟎 )𝚫𝐟̃𝐧
                                                 𝟐                     𝟐
As we want to desegregate the variations of the Leontief matrix, we also have to the decomposition for 𝚫𝐙̃. As suggested by
Miller & Blair (2009), it becomes:
                                                       𝚫𝐙̃ = 𝐙̃𝟏 𝚫𝐀 ̃𝐧 𝐙̃𝟎
                                                          ̃𝐧 , so we also do the decomposition for it. Remembering that 𝐀
Also, we want to take a deep look at the determinants of 𝚫𝐀                                                              ̃𝐧 =
𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐀∗𝐧 , so we have
                                                  𝟏                                  𝟏 𝐩 −𝟏           𝐩 −𝟏
                                         ̃𝐧 =
                                        𝚫𝐀          𝚫(𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 )(𝐀∗𝐧 𝟏 + 𝐀∗𝐧 𝟎 ) + (𝐱̂ 𝟏 + 𝐱̂ 𝟎 ) 𝚫𝐀∗𝐧
                                                  𝟐                                  𝟐
As we defined 𝐀∗𝐧 = 𝐀𝐧 𝐱̂ 𝐩 , its variation 𝚫𝐀∗𝐧 is calculated as:
                                                       𝟏                           𝟏
                                              𝚫𝐀∗𝐧 = 𝚫𝐀𝐧 (𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝟏 + 𝐱̂ 𝐩 𝟎 ) + (𝐀𝐧 𝟏 + 𝐀𝐧 𝟎 )𝚫𝐱̂ 𝐩
                                                       𝟐                           𝟐
If we substitute 𝚫𝐀∗𝐧 and 𝚫𝐀    ̃𝐧 inside 𝚫𝐙̃, we will have
              𝟏                                𝟏 𝐩 −𝟏         𝐩 −𝟏     𝟏                             𝟏 𝐩 −𝟏    𝐩 −𝟏      𝟏
   𝚫𝐙̃ = 𝐙̃𝟏 ( 𝚫(𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 )(𝐀∗𝐧 𝟏 + 𝐀∗𝐧 𝟎 ) + (𝐱̂ 𝟏 + 𝐱̂ 𝟎 ) [ (𝐀𝐧 𝟏 + 𝐀𝐧 𝟎 )𝚫𝐱̂ 𝐩 ] + (𝐱̂ 𝟏 + 𝐱̂ 𝟎 ) [ (𝐀𝐧 𝟏 + 𝐀𝐧 𝟎 )𝚫𝐱̂ 𝐩 ]) 𝐙̃𝟎
              𝟐                                𝟐                       𝟐                             𝟐                   𝟐
For the modified final demand, defined as 𝐟̃𝐧 = 𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 𝐟𝐧 , its variation is found by:
                                                   𝟏                                𝟏
                                           𝚫𝐟̃𝐧 = 𝚫(𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏 )(𝐟𝐧 𝟏 + 𝐟𝐧 𝟎 ) + (𝐱̂ 𝐩 −𝟏     𝟏 +𝐱    ̂ 𝐩 −𝟏
                                                                                                       𝟎 )𝚫𝐟𝐧

Replacing 𝚫𝐙̃ and 𝚫𝐟̃𝐧 inside 𝚫𝐱𝐯 , we find:

Each variable from the above equation has the contributions of volume and relative prices. The properly disaggregation is done
to isolate the volume effect, and the relative prices effect.

                                                                                    𝐩

disaggregated in the contribution of 𝐃𝐩 , 𝐃𝐯 , 𝐝𝐅𝐧 , 𝐝𝐯𝐅𝐧 . As we want to observe the trade pattern of national demand, we
disaggregate that national demand in total and imported final demand, specific for variables expressed in volume.
Gross output’s volume change is rearranged to capture the volume (𝛖) and relative price contribution (𝛒). If we divide each
change by total gross output in the initial period (𝑥0 ), we have the contribution of each factor to total gross output
