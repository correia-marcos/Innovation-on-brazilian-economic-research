          We study how survey respondents and public statistics institutes interact in a primary
      information market through a game-theoretic approach. Our model is a two-stage game
      in which a respondent has to provide data, accurately or not, to an statistics institute.
      The institute, in turn, must choose between accepting the initial obtained information
      or engaging in an auditing process. We nd that provision of accurate information by
      survey respondents is dependent on their cost to acquire information, the auditing strategy
      employed by the institutes and ne sizes. We comment on how credibility regarding the
      threat of nes can impact the respondent's behavior. Finally, we explore how the existence
      of a public policy which uses the respondent's information as input can act as an indirect
      incentive towards accurate data provision.

1        Introduction

    Eciently planning and executing both public and private policies is conditioned on having

well-informed decision makers.        It is essential that high quality information is produced and

made promptly available for these decision makers (United Nations Statistic Division, 2015).

    A policy that aims to redesign of an educational system, for example, requires a snapshot

of the system's current infrastructure, as well as a correct assessment on the performance of its

students and teachers. As these policies turns towards more specic goals, there is increasing

demand for higher-frequency, disaggregated and accurate data. For example, having a socially-

inclusive policy regarding disabled people requires regional indicators on accessibility, labor

market as well as the specic demands from the several kinds of disabled people.         These, in

turn, require an advanced data collection infrastructure.

    This information is initially, and mainly, produced by statistics institutes, which are re-

sponsible for gathering and processing raw data. Most countries have their own governmental

institutions to produce and disseminate primary data, such as: United States Census Bureau,

Statistics Canada, Bureau of Statistics (Japan) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and

Statistics.

    However, recent studies have shown that these statistics institutions are facing rising di-

culties in these data collecting processes. According to MEYER et al. (2015), there are mainly

two classes of problems, non-response and lack of robustness. There has been an increase in

non-response rates from surveyed units. In the National Health Interview Survey1 , for example,

non-response has increased from 8% to 24% between 1997 and 2013. The second problem is

due to lack of consistency among data collected by dierent institutions, which signals that

data being collected needs to be more accurate.

    Although there is constant improvement in statistical methods that aim to reduce the per-

verse eects of non-response, the latter continuous growth could result in long-term lower

quality data (SINGLETON and STRAITS, 2017). The ecient usage of resources should also

be a topic of concern. CURTIN et al. (2005) acknowledges that the decline in response rates is

also generating growing data collection costs.

    In this paper, we aim to present aspects of the strategic interaction between participants of

a primary data collection process. There are primarily two factors that support our research

agenda. First, from an empirical perspective, statistical institutions face daily routine problems

in gathering information.        Although several respondents comply with the proposed surveys,

some of these participants still end up providing inaccurate data, while others opt out of the

surveys altogether. Our paper comments on the possibilities that could prompt these actions

during the data gathering interaction.

    The second factor is related to a research gap on this particular topic.        There is ample

literature that analyzes the relationship between experts and lesser informed parts, for example

the branch of Communication Games, more specically the Sender-Receiver models, such as

    1A   survey conducted by the CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Cheap-Talk. Also, the Inspection Games literature has made several advancements regarding

the design of monitoring mechanisms.           Despite these advances, however, there has been no

theoretical economic model specically design to comment on to the primary data collection

scenario2 .

     We setup a survey environment in which an institute seeks to collect private data from a

respondent, using a Game-Theoretic approach. We comment on the economic analysis possibly

performed by survey respondents, which involves a comparison of the costs of gathering and

transmitting the requested data in contrast with the consequences of non-complying, as well as

the behavior and auditing strategies of statistics institutes.

     We analyze non-compliance using two dierent approaches. First, we observe the impacts

of punishment by the institute through the application of nes. We also comment on how the

existence of public policies that are based on the collected data could have an indirect impact on

the collection process itself. Finally, we also provide a short extension regarding time dynamics

by implementing a discount rate, as well as possible issues regarding credibility.

     This paper is structured in ve sections, including this introduction.              The next section

presents a brief literature review. In the third section, our baseline model is introduced, while

some extensions are shown in the fourth section. Our concluding remarks are in the fth section.




2      Literature review

     The primary data collection market depends on the interaction between two parts: statistics

institutes and respondent agents. The institute selects participants, intentionally or randomly,

to report private, unobservable data. This data is collected through methods such as surveys,

and the resulting product is a set of primary statistics. These are then made available to the

society3 .

     The main goal of statistics institutes is to be a source of unique information regarding

dierent characteristics of a given society (United Nations Statistic Division, 2015). This en-

compasses social, economics and environmental features, for example. In order to met this goal,

these institutes have to continuously adapt to changes in data needs, as well as ensure that the

produced data is of high quality.

     According to the United Nations Statistic Division (2012), quality is dened as a multidi-

mensional attribute. It is composed of aspects such as: (A) relevance, the correct matching of

the institutes supply and societies data demands, (B) accuracy, the statistics precision of data,

(C) accessibility, regarding dierent methods of accessing data as well as the availability of mi-

crodata , (D) clarity, ease of reading and interpretation and (E) coherence, which encompasses

the possibility of combining dierent types of statistics4 .

     We restrict the multidimensionality of primary data quality, in our paper, by performing

an economic analysis of market and agent behavior features that could have an eect on the

    2 To the best of our knowledge.

accuracy measurement. This is a dierent approach from the usual statistical method analysis,

which is focused on index construction techniques, sample size and distribution among other

aspects.

   Our paper presents an applied Game Theory model consisting of two types of players, a

survey respondent and a statistics institute. The respondent is selected by the institute to take

part in a survey, and he has to decide whether to provide a true or an inaccurate information.

After this information is transmitted, the institute chooses whether or not to audit this data.

Although this specic analysis has not yet been performed, we utilized characteristics from

dierent branches of the Game Theory literature, which we briey comment below, as to

provide further insights into our own modeling strategies.

   A similar problem is presented by ALLINGHAM and SANDMO (1972), in which an agent

has to report his yearly income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If he chooses to omit

part of his income on the report, less taxes will be due, however he will also be exposed to the

possibility of an auditing process and subsequent nes.

   In this model, the agent's actual income,         W,   is known to him, but is not observable by

the IRS. The latter only has access to the reported income         X,   and has to act based on this

information.                            Œ∏, such that Œ∏X is the amount paid to the IRS. The
                  Tax rates are dened by

possibility of auditing is measured by p, and if the agent is caught in this process, he has to

pay a ne that is based on the dierence between actual and declared income, œÄ(W ‚àí X).

The agent's expected utility function is then as follows, which is solved by standard static

optimization methods.



                        E[U ] = pU (W ‚àí Œ∏X ‚àí œÄ(W ‚àí X)) + (1 ‚àí p)U (W ‚àí Œ∏X)

   There are two main results in ALLINGHAM and SANDMO (1972). The rst is that the

agent's decision on omitting income is dependent on his degree of absolute and relative risk

aversion, which the IRS has no control of.          However, the increase of both the probability of

detection,   p,   and penalty rate   œÄ   have direct impacts on reducing income omission. Being the

case that the IRS is able to aect those two variables makes this model particularly interesting

to policy-makers.

   In a survey environment, however, it is dicult to perceive, at least initially, any direct gains

from intentionally providing inaccurate data.         Also, we can not establish empirical evidence

regarding the existence of penalties that are directly related to the distance between actual and

reported information regarding primary data collection.         This is signicantly dierent to the

direct relationship that exists in omitting a larger income parcel to the IRS and the perpetrator's

gains.

   Provision of inaccurate data is commonly explored in Communication Games, more specially

the Cheap-Talk literature. Cheap-Talk focus is on models of information transmission between

two parts, with costless signaling.        These two parts are the sender (S ), an expert which has

access to private information, and the receiver (R), the uninformed part who does not observe

the private information and depends on signaling provided by the sender in order to implement



                                                     4
a policy.

      In the seminal paper by CRAWFORD and SOBEL (1982), the sender costlessly observe

a private information,             m,   with   f (m)   and   F (m)    being its PDF and CDF, respectively. After

observing this information, he generates and transmits a signal (n) to the receiver, who inter-

prets this signal and implements a policy,                   y.    The participants utility functions are given by

U R (y, m) and          U S (y, m, b), which indicates that both participants depend on the information
and the policy function.                As the choice of     n    aects the policy function   y,   note that   US   also

depends indirectly on             n.   Compatibility of interests between the two parts are measured by               b   .

      The sender's problem is to choose a feasible signal                 n that maximizes his utility,   taking both

m    and    b   as given. He uses a signaling rule function,             q(n‚à£m), where the signal n is    conditioned

on   m.     The receiver problem is to maximizes his expected utility.                    Note that as the receiver

observes the signal and not the actual information                      m,   he utilizes a conditional probability of

m    given      n,   that is,   p(m‚à£n),   to weight his expected utility.

      The main nding in CRAWFORD and SOBEL (1982) is that although signaling is costless,

perfect communication does not happen unless the sender and receiver interests coincide. As

bias regarding interests grows, less information is actually provided in the signal. One limiting

case is that of a babbling equilibria, where the signal is entirely composed by noise.

      Since then, the basic Crawford-Sobel model has received a number of extensions, of which

we deem the results in ISHIDA and SHIMIZU (2016) particularly interesting to our own model.

The paper analyzes the eects of a partially informed receiver, which is modeled as both the

receiver and the sender initially receiving a costless signal regarding the true nature of the

information. The main implication of this assumption is that as the receiver's information set

gets more informative, there are less incentives for informative signals by the sender5 .

      Finally, our modeling approach also utilizes insights from the Inspection Games framework.

The setup is of an inspector who has to dene an optimal auditing strategy over an inspectee.

This branch of the literature started with the paper by DRESHER (1962), regarding arms

control auditing processes. A stylized version is as follows6 .

      There exists an international arms agreement, in which its participants are hence forbidden

to acquire certain weapons, for example, nuclear ones.                          The participant can follow to the

agreement or he can stock illegal weapons. A third party is then responsible for monitoring the

participants for possible breach of rules. It is assumed that the action is veriable, that is, the

third party can correctly identify existing weapons on the participants' military sites.

      When the inspectee complies with the agreement, both players payos are null, whether

there is an inspection or not. If illegal behavior goes undetected, the payos are                     (‚àíc, d), and if
this behavior is detected, the payos are                (‚àía, ‚àíb).     It is assumed that   0 < a < c and b, d > 0, so
that the inspector prefers identifying illegal behavior. The verication process used is imperfect,

where       1‚àíŒ≤      is the probability of illegal behavior detection.

      A stable solution where legal behavior is attained is conditional on the non-detection prob-

                                                                  5
ability being suciently small,     Œ≤ <    1
                                          1+ db
                                                .   This value is dependent on the ratio of unveried

illegal behavior (d), and punishment      b.   An increase in expected illegal behavior gains, which is
                       d
represented by a larger , for example, requires an even smaller
                        b                                                    Œ≤.
    A game model in which the inspector faces a time-dependent loss function is presented in

DIAMOND (1982). The loss function is given by              L = f (td ‚àí s),   where   td ‚àí s   is the number of

periods the illegal behavior remained undetected. Adopting a monotonic function, the higher

td ‚àí s   is, the costlier it gets to the inspector. The author was able to derive a explicit solution

to the case of a linear loss function, as well as propose a solution method for the non-linear

case.

    This proposition is further developed in ROTHENSTEIN and ZAMIR (2002), which also

uses a time-dependent loss function but also incorporates an imperfect monitoring technology.

This allows for the existence of false alarms, in which the inspector may declare the inspectee

guilty when he actually is not. The opposite may also happen, as the inspector consider the

inspectee actions were legal when they were not. This approach is akin to incorporating type

one and two errors in a classical statistics hypothesis testing approach, with these errors being

dependent on agent behavior. A unique solution to this class of problems is also obtained.

    Given this short introduction to the related literature, in the next section we present our

baseline model.




3        Baseline model: A Two-Stage Survey Game

    We will establish a simple communication game between two economic agents, a statistics

institute and a respondent, in which the institute applies a survey to the respondent in order

to obtain a certain private data.

    We deemed appropriate to restrict the nature of statistic institute to a public or governmen-

tal rm. Private research institutes have a wide set of actions, and can, for instance, employ

incentive mechanisms such as direct monetary payments to elicit the desired behavior of survey

participants. If we had included these types of institutions, we would end up just mimicking

results already explored in microeconomic theory.

    A second assumption we make is on the nature of the private information. We shall limit it

to knowledge that is not promptly available to the respondent. That is, we are dealing with an

information good that has a level of nesse, for which an acquisition cost exists. Our assumption

includes, for example, the case of rms reporting monthly produced units of a certain subgroup

of products or producer prices, as well as individuals who have to fully disclose expenditure

habits. Thus, our assumption excludes data that is already available to the respondent, such

as her os his marital status, educational degree or the number of washrooms available at home.

    Although these two assumptions may seem strict at rst, they actually represent a major

proportion of surveys being performed by ocial statistics institutes such as consumer expen-

diture surveys and industrial Production indexes.

    The game's timeline is as follows: (1) an agent is chosen to take part in a survey by the




                                                       6
statistics institute, (2) the respondent agent decide whether or not to incur in information

acquisition costs and transmits the data, which may or not be accurate information, (3) the

institute decides whether to audit this data, and (4) the payos are given to the participants.

We can now fully dene the structure and variables of our model:


   ¬à   There is only one institute and one respondent.                            Their utility functions are             UI   e   U R,
       respectively.


   ¬à   The requested information is a random variable,                          Œ∏,    and its distribution, with PDF               f (Œ∏)
       and CDF        F (Œ∏),    is common knowledge.                 This means that both the institute and the

       respondent have information regarding the expected interval of the random variable, but

       they do not know its actual true value, which is also dened as                                 Œ∏.

   ¬à   In order to obtain the true value                  Œ∏,   the respondent has to pay a xed cost                      K,   where

       K > 0;

   ¬à   The information sent by the respondent is                      Œ∏ÃÇ,   which may or may not coincide with the

       true value     Œ∏.   In order to report the true value, that is,                   Œ∏ÃÇ = Œ∏,   he will need to incur in the

       data acquisition cost;


   ¬à   The institute may audit the colected data. This procedure is able to correctly identify

       false data. Auditing has a xed cost to the institute, which is                              A,   where   A > 0;

   ¬à   If the respondent sent false data and is audited by the institute, a ne                              F   is applied, with

       F > 0.

   An extensive form representation of this game is despited in gure 1. An important aspect

of this game is the information set of the institute: it is not certain of the previous move by

the respondent, that is, if the respondent sent accurate or inaccurate information.

    The utility of not auditing is measured by the dierence between the reported and true

value of the information. The underlying intuition is that when these values coincide, the term

is nullied, while an inaccurate value generates disutility.                The quadratic term assigns more

weight to larger dierences between these values.

    However, this description is not entirely correct. Although                 f (Œ∏)   is common knowledge, at

the second stage the institute only observes           Œ∏ÃÇ   and is not able to infer what the respondent's

action in the earlier stage was. Thus, even when the respondent complies with the acquisition

cost and reports an accurate value,         Œ∏ÃÇ = Œ∏,   the institute has no means of acknowledging this

situation unless an audit is performed. We then interpret this quadratic term as a measure of

expected loss when not auditing, which depends both on                  f (Œ∏)   and the reported value.

    If an auditing process is performed, false data is correctly identied, and the institute

forcefully obtain the accurate information. In this case,            Œ∏ÃÇ = Œ∏, while at a cost A to the institute.
As such, the respondent is obliged to now incur in the acquisition cost, if he had not done so,

as well as pay a ne which amounts to           F.    One could argue that the respondent could, again,

report a dierent value.       We assume that the auditing process requires further reports, at a

negligible cost to someone who has already incurred in the acquisition cost 7 .

    The respondent's utility, equation (2), is also composed of these two parts.                         If he opts

to report the accurate value in the rst place, he must incur in the acquisition cost,                     K.   If he

provides an inaccurate value, he is exposed to the possibility of a ne                 F   and a forced acquisition

cost. This is weighted by the probability of an audit, which is explained further along.

    Note that the ne amount F is exogenously to our model. We assume that the institute has

no means of directly controlling this size, which is consistent with the actual process of legally

dening ne amounts. Also, the institute does not receive monetary feedback from applying

nes. If this were the case, it could elicit an undesired behavior prole from the institute8 . An

empirically consistent interpretation to this assumption is that collected nes are transfered to

a central government branch.

    This class of game is solved using Backward Induction (OSBORNE, 2003). The rst step

is to analyze the institute's decision on whether or not to audit.                          Equation (3) represents

   8A particularly interesting situation arises in ANDREOZZI (2004), which employs an applied Inspection
Game model to crime deterrence. The theoretical results point that larger incentives for the inspector's behaviors
eventually reduce their inspection frequency,

    It is decreasing on the variance of     Œ∏.    A higher variance means that there is a larger interval of

   If the respondent is audited but had transmitted accurate data, he incurs in no additional

and a subsequent ne. Through equation (8) we can derive the optimal inaccurate data to be

reported by the respondent, which is given by the variable's distribution mean, equation (9).

This reporting strategy is such that it minimizes his exposure to audits.

    As information acquisition costs grow, there are fewer incentives for the respondent to incur

in them, such that the minimum ne must be larger.            Auditing costs appear indirectly in

the cumulative probability function   G:   higher auditing costs imply a smaller probability of its

occurrence, which in turn must be compensated by an increase in ne size. In similar fashion, an

increase in the random variable's variance also prompts a higher auditing probability, resulting

in a smaller ne.    These results are expressed in equation (13).         The partial derivatives are

    Although we do not explicitly dene the parameters of the acquisition costs, they could be

related to two main aspects. The rst is the complexity of the requested data, which could range

from a simple to an intricate report, meaning a lower or a higher          K,   respectively. A promptly

available information, for example, would translate to a          K = 0,   a case which we purposely

left out of our model.   Secondly, the respondent's size could also aect acquisition costs.          A

small start-up company could present a higher acquisition cost than its already established

counterpart. The auditing costs could also depend on similar characteristics, such as complex

information being harder to audit, the institute's size and its available auditing technology.

    Finally, note that there is a trade-o between auditing probabilities and ne sizes.           This

result is empirically consistent, as institutes hardly have the necessary budget to audit every

single survey participant.   So, in designing the optimal ne size, this could be taken into

consideration.

    In the next section, we explore a few extensions to our baseline model, such as: (a) analyze

the eects of indirect incentives, such as the implementation of a public policy that use the

gathered information and (b) the signicance of discount rates and credibility.

    Comparing (17) with (13), we can see that              M IN < F M IN .
                                                          Fpp                      The public policy function acts

as an additional incentive for survey respondents. The policy function also manages to mitigate

the risk of non-accurate information if the ne amount is somehow limited by an exogenous

upper bound, such as      F M IN > FÃÑ > Fpp
                                         M IN .

    Valuing how much a public policy is worth is not without its own problems, however, and is

one of the objects for applications of the Contingent Valuation literature, where agents try to

attribute value to goods whose price is not directly observed (Hausman, 2012). Hence, one could

argue that the total eect of public policy is actually both itself and the public's perception of

it. Bringing awareness to results of information usages to a society could be a possible way to

drive this perception rating up, hence, improving its eect on survey compliance behavior.

    Finally, note that with the addition of a public policy in our model, we could also generate

a cyclical feature. As policies are implemented or are better perceived by the respondent, they

act as an incentive for him to provide accurate data, which in turn, could further increase the

  11 By doing so, we simplify our analysis by excluding the possibility of a conict of interests, as well as the
eciency of the third party.

4.2         Discount rate and credibility

   An interesting addition to our baseline model is to consider a more complex approach to

the auditing process. Suppose that, as it begins, the respondent has to incur in the acquisition

cost, but the ne is only applied at a latter period. This dynamic captures the delay that exists

between the penalty notices and actual payments.

   If this were the case, the utility function in equation (2) would be adjusted by a discount

factor   Œ≤ t,   with   Œ≤ ‚àà [0, 1],   where     t represents the delay,   in periods, between notice and payment.

   Condition (11) has to be updated, which respectively impacts the minimum ne amount in

equation (13). Now, the minimum ne amount also has to compensate for higher impatience,

a lower     Œ≤,   as well as lags between notice and payment, that is, a higher             t.

   Note that if  Œ≤ = 1 we return to our baseline model. In                   the limiting case, if   Œ≤   is arbitrarily

low,   we end up with limŒ≤ t ‚Üí0 F M IN = ‚àû. In this latter case,             there is not much that the institute

can do, as there is no feasible ne size that is able to drive accurate data provision.

   A dierent interpretation of this type of formulation is that it can capture the institute's

enforcement capability, or credibility, as perceived by the respondent. Suppose that in an one-

round game, that the respondent has lower expectations about the ne being actually applied if

he is caught in an auditing process. In this scenario, which can be represented by an arbitrarily

high   t,   the ne has little to no impact on his decision.

   Thus, our model hints that credibility regarding punishment could play a role in under-

standing general survey behavior in dierent environments. A proxy for this variable, could be,

for example the condence level that the respective respondent has regarding Courts: while in

Japan, the category "None at all" and "Not very much" were combined to a total of 15,9%, in

Brazil these categories amounted to 49% (World Value Surveys, 2014).



4.3         Public policy function in a multiple respondent environment

   In this section we extend our base model with two distinct aspects. First, we increase the

number of survey respondents to two:                    i and j, each with their respective access to private

information, that is         Œ∏i   and   Œ∏j ,   respectively. Then we build on a indirect incentive mechanism

in the form of a public policy function,                Œ≥,   that is implemented by an exogenous third party,

but is aected by information gathered from survey respondents.


                                                               13
   With two participants, the expected utility of the institute when not auditing either of them

is given by13 :



                                 E[U I ‚à£ ‚àº Ai,j ] = E[‚àí(Œ∏ÀÜi ‚àí Œ∏i )2 ‚àí (Œ∏ÀÜj ‚àí Œ∏j )2 ]
                                  E[U ‚à£ ‚àº Ai,j ] = 2Œ∏ÀÜi E[Œ∏i ] ‚àí V ar(Œ∏i ) ‚àí E[Œ∏i ]2 ‚àí Œ∏ÀÜi 2

                                  E[U ‚à£ ‚àº Ai,j ] = Wi + Wj                                                               (19)



   Where      Wi   and    Wj   are measures of expected loss by the institute:



                                        Wi ‚â° 2Œ∏ÀÜi E[Œ∏i ] ‚àí V ar(Œ∏i ) ‚àí E[Œ∏i ]2 ‚àí Œ∏ÀÜi 2
                                       Wj ‚â° 2Œ∏ÀÜj E[Œ∏j ] ‚àí V ar(Œ∏j ) ‚àí E[Œ∏j ]2 ‚àí Œ∏ÀÜj 2

   The other cases of expected utilities are obtained by combining dierent auditing composi-

tions, which are:



                                                 E[U ‚à£Ai , ‚àº Aj ] = Wj ‚àí A
                                                E[U ‚à£ ‚àº Ai , Aj ] = Wi ‚àí A
                                                         E[U ‚à£Ai , Aj ] = ‚àí2A

   In this case, we will use a particular case of the public function                        Œ≥   in which its eectiveness is

proportional to the amount of accurate information collected by the institute. This is expressed

in equation (20).
                                                                                           ‚àëi=1 Ti
                                                                                             n
                               Eectiveness of additive public policy                  =           Œ≥                     (20)

   In this case,     Ti   is a counter variable which accounts for the total of accurate data collected.

This occurs in two dierent scenarios: (1) the survey respondent initially provided the institute

with an accurate value, that is,             Œ∏ÀÜi = Œ∏Àúi   and (2) the respondent provided inaccurate data but

was audited (Ai or        Aj )

    There is, however, an important factor that we are not taking into consideration, which

is the interaction between nes and rm sizes: even though a certain ne amount can act as

huge driving force for small rms, for example, it can not be so for larger corporations.      In

order to incorporate this, we would need to remodel our respondents with a higher degree of

heterogeneity.




5    Concluding remarks

    The main contribution of this paper is to oer a novel game-theoretic approach to analyze

the strategic interaction between survey applicants and respondents, more specically the case

of a public statistics institute.    Public institutes, being limited to a stricter set of actions

while compared to their private counterparts, provide a rich environment for agent behavior

commentary and policy analysis.

    In our baseline model, provision of accurate information is dependent on the true informa-

tion's acquisition costs, and is largely aected by both the auditing policy by the institute,

and ne sizes. A public policy that utilizes information as input can also serve as an indirectly

reward for accurate survey compliance. The respondent's credibility regarding the applicability

of nes also play a role in their decision process.

    We were able to derive a mathematical condition that relates ne amounts and accurate

responses on surveys. While we acknowledge our result is far from being directly applicable, it

can represent a rst step towards a more robust theoretical background when designing nes.

    Our baseline model also provides a few possible extensions.       The case of credibility can

be further explored by setting a repeated game environment.          There is also the possibility

of implementing a strategic interaction between survey respondents, by further exploring the

multi-participant game. Finally, although some of the main driving variables to our baseline

model are currently exogenous, extensions could allow for the institute to aect both internal

auditing costs and the respondent's transmission costs through investment in research and

development.
