Abstract. We provide information about the Brazilian business cycle from 1947 to 2012, by
suggesting a new method that averages over a variety of HP-filters and creates a set of facts which
are more related to CODACE dates of expansions and recessions. The main findings are that
Brazilian business cycle is asymmetric, with expansions lasting longer than recessions; the long-
term trend presented a noticeable flatter slope after the 1980s, thus, real long-term growth rate
decreased by 50%, from 8% per year, between 1947 and 1980, to 4% per year after that; and, output
volatility decreased after 1996-1997, when a statistically significant structural break occurred.

Resumo. O presente artigo fornece fatos estilizados dos ciclos de negócios brasileiros para o
período de 1947 a 2012, propondo um método de decomposição tendência-ciclo que toma uma
média de vários resultados de filtragens HP e gera um conjunto de informações mais correlacionado
com as datas de expansões e recessões do CODACE. Os principais resultados obtidos são que os
ciclos brasileiros são assimétricos, com expansões mais longas que recessões; que a tendência de
crescimento de longo-prazo apresentou uma significante redução em sua inclinação (cerca de 50%),
fazendo a taxa de crescimento reduzir de 8% ao ano entre 1947 e 1980, para 4% ao ano em seguida;
e, que a volatilidade do produto real se reduziu em 1996 ou 1997, quando uma quebra estrutural
significativa foi encontrada.

1. Introduction
Economics has traditionally studied business cycle, but the contributions of Burns and Mitchell
(1946) were a watershed, prompting a wave of interest in regularities and features of economic
activity and its fluctuations in many countries. Such investigation assumes great relevance
whenever it comes to provide grounds for policy-making (both public and private), forecasting,
model calibration, and theories testing, to name a few. However, as it is stated in the recent
literature, in order to obtain consistent business cycle information, one of the main issues is how to
separate the input series into trend and cycle components. The answer for that is not trivial, and it is
the object of this research work.
        We will focus on depicting facts about the Brazilian business cycles, by decomposing a
quarterly and seasonally adjusted GDP time series for the 1947-2012 period. Amongst all the
currently available trend-cycle decomposition methods, the Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP-filter,
Hodrick and Prescott, 1997) stands out most. The HP-filter has been largely employed. Examples
include Kydland and Prescott (1990), Backus Kehoe (1992), Ravn and Uhlig (2002) and, more
recently, Perron and Wada (2009) and Kodama (2013), who applied it to U.S. and international
data. For the Brazilian case, this filter was utilized, inter alia, by Ellery-Jr., et al. (2002), Ellery-Jr.
and Gomes (2005) and Araújo, et al. (2008).
        Other popular methods to extract the cyclical component of time series include the BN-
decomposition (Beveridge and Nelson, 1981), based on unconstrained ARIMA models and
estimated by Campbell and Mankiw (1987), and Morley, et al. (2003) for the U.S., and by Cribari-
Neto, (1990; 1993) for the Brazilian economy; the band-pass filter (Baxter and King, 1999), used by
Basu and Taylor (1999) and Ellery-Jr., et al. (2002); and the unobserved components model, UC,
due to Clark (1987) and considered by Morley, et al. (2003) and Perron and Wada (2009). As far as
we know, the UC model has not yet been applied to the Brazilian GDP decomposition.
Nevertheless, Kannebley and Gremaud (2003) employ such type of methodology in an interesting
study concerning the secular trend of the Brazilian terms of trade.
        Although the trend-cycle decomposition has become computationally simpler due to all
abovementioned methods, practitioners still face some key problems. For instance, one can show
that the HP-filter outcome is extremely dependent on the smooth parameter (λ) and, most of the
time, the rule of thumb for setting up its value, provided by Hodrick and Prescott (1997) and
broadly employed, is not adequate (Perron and Wada, 2009).
        Another notorious problem is that distinct decomposition procedures may lead to rather
different trend–cycle components and stylized facts about economic activity. Canova (1998), for
example, studies this question for the U.S. economy, showing that some evidence is not robust to
changes in the filter. Besides, the dissimilarities between the cyclic component of the BN and UC
methods are examined by Morley et al. (2003). The BN-cycle tends to be quite noisy and leaves
more of the fluctuation for the trend component, while the UC models lead to larger and more
persistent cyclic oscillations. Therefore, the choice of a specific method for filtering the data is by
no means inconsequential, and probably affects the main results and brings policy implications.
        The Brazilian GDP trend and cycle decomposition may be also facing these problems. In
this respect, some recent results contradict the common view that, since the Real Plan
implementation in July 1994, the Brazilian economy has become more stable. Araújo, et al. (2008)
and Ellery-Jr. and Gomes (2005), for example, after using a HP-filter (λ=100), found that the
Brazilian GDP volatility did not decrease in the post-war period. Additionally, Cribari-Neto (1990,
1993), while studying the annual Brazilian GNP and GDP data, respectively, from 1900 to 1990,
and using the BN-filter, argued that the cyclic component of the Brazilian economic activity is
small; that is, most of its oscillations are driven by “real-long-term” shocks to the trend. This
conclusion does not match with Cunha and Ferreira (2004), who found that the welfare losses due
to output fluctuations are significant in Brazil and reached up to 10%, a value higher than those
estimated for the U.S. economy (see, e.g., Barlevy, 2004). Consequently, there is still room for
improvements in the understanding of the Brazilian business cycle, which is a deep concern of the
present work.
        Two main contributions are provided. First, our estimation uses a new quarterly time series
measured by Bonelli and Rodrigues (2012) for the period between 1947 and 1979, and by the
Brazilian National Accounts System from then on (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística,
IBGE, 2012). The first set of observations was calculated so as to be readily comparable to the
second one, which avoids approximation errors. However, it should be clear that, when analysing a
quarterly time series, we are able to cover oscillations shorter than one year and to compare our
business cycle dates to those established by the Brazilian Business Cycle Dating Committee,
                                                     1
CODACE, for the years between 1980 and 20091. Thus, as in the U.S. case, the Brazilian economy
also has a natural benchmark for the trend-cycle decomposition evaluation when studying higher
frequency data.
        Second and more importantly, based on the theories of model and forecast combination, and
by exploring the flexibility of the HP-filter, we provide a new scheme to compute average trend and
cycle components in which the problems of filter selection are reduced. The basic idea is that, by
varying the filter‟s smoothness parameter properly, one can potentially reproduce the results of
almost, if not all, the other methods (from the BN-filter oscillating trend, to the smooth
deterministic trends). In this sense, we calculate a large variety of HP-filters with different values
for λ, and then we take an average from the decomposition outcomes. The combination of different
trend and cycle series is appealing since it produces components that are more adaptable in the
presence of structural breaks, and it can be understood as a way to make the filtering procedure
more robust against misspeciﬁcation biases and measurement errors, when compared to individual
methods2. Hence, the evidence reported here tends to be more reliable than that which is grounded
on “once and for all” decompositions.
        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and discusses the
trend-cycle decomposition procedure. Section 3 presents some preliminary results, unit root tests
and comparisons between our method and the CODACE business cycle dates. Section 4 brings the
filtered Brazilian GDP‟s facts and information, using a quarterly data set ranging from 1947 to
2012, while subsection 4.1 implements a number of robustness and structural change tests. Finally,
section 5 shows the main conclusions and implications of the research work.

2. The Hodrick-Prescott filter and the average cycle
This section presents the trend-cycle decomposition method applied in the paper, covering briefly
the mathematics of the HP-filter, then discussing its main caveats, and finally showing how we can
overcome them.
        The Hodrick-Prescott filter is a method developed for extracting a smoothed version, τt,
from some given original series, say yt. The τt component is considered as being the long-term
trend, while the residuals, yt - τt, contain the cyclic components. A parameter, λ, controls the
smoothness of the trend series. As it tends to infinity, τt approaches the linear trend case (Hodrick
and Prescott, 1997).
        The value to be chosen for λ is still an open question in the economic literature, and it can
have profound practical consequences. A wrong λ, for instance, may impute the greater part of the
yt‟s variation to the trend, leaving the cyclic component economically irrelevant. Nevertheless, most
of the researchers, for the sake of simplicity, just follow the recommendations of Hodrick and
Prescott (1997), setting it as 1600 for quarterly data3 (e.g. Kydland and Prescott, 1990; Backus and
Kehoe, 1992; Ellery-Jr., et al., 2002; Ellery-Jr. and Gomes, 2005; Araújo, et al., 2008; and
Michaelides, et al., 2013; amongst several others).
        On the other hand, Perron and Wada (2009) show that a λ=800,000 is good choice for
detrending the U.S. quarterly real GDP during the period between 1947:01 and 1998:02. While
Pedersen (2001), making an effort to find the best value for λ based on the theory of optimal
filtering, suggests a value around 1,000 and 1,050 for this parameter on quarterly data.
        Possibly, the only consensus economists have reached regarding λ is that its value must
represent the underlying structure of some data generating process (DGP). However, since a DGP
may vary across countries and across the time, it turns out to be extremely difficult to elect a
particular smoothness parameter as the true one. Indeed, a good procedure shall consider a set of

 They found this value by squaring the ratio of the cyclical component‟s variance, set as 5% per quarter, and the
variance of second differenced term, set as 1/8% per quarter.

conceivable values and find out a way to use this information in order to highlight features of the
data set. This is exactly how we proceed in the present paper.
         The method proposed here comprises two steps. First, it decomposes the original series, in
our case the Brazilian quarterly GDP, into trend and cycle components by using the HP-filter with a
variety of smoothness parameters. Second, it takes the mean over the outcome of these filtering
processes, which can provides series with remarkable features, as discussed later. It is a simple
method, nevertheless, strongly based on results obtained by the theory of model combination. Now,
let us turn to details of each step, beginning with the second one.
         The true trend and cycle components of an economic time series are unknown. Practitioners
try to model them, employing a specific method and choosing some parameters of control, such as λ
in the HP-filter case. Now, suppose that we are interested in examine the variable yc, say, the GDP
cyclic component of any country, and that two options, yc1 and yc2, are available, namely, the
outcome of two different HP-filters provided by distinct analysts. Let the ﬁrst guess be based on
some N1-vector of information x, i.e., yc1 = g1(x) while the second is based on some N2-vector of
information z, i.e., yc2 = g2(z)4. If {x, z}, the full information set, were observable, it would be
natural to construct a model based on all variables contained in x and z, i.e., yc3 = g3(x,z). On the
other hand, if only the values of yc1 and yc2 are observed by the modeller (while the underlying
variables are not), then the theories of model and forecast combination states that the better strategy
is to combine these guesses, using a model of the type yc,m = gc(yc1,yc2; w), where w refers to the
combination weights (cf., Clemen, 1987; Timmermann, 2006; and Moral-Benito, 2015).
         In this paper, we assign equal weights for w, since this assumption has been providing good
results even when comparing to others more elegant combinations of weights (Clemen, 1989, p.559;
Moral-Benito, 2015). By their turn, Palm and Zellner (1992) find that adopting a simple average
method is interesting because in many situations it will achieve a substantial reduction in the
variance and bias of the forecasts. In addition, Timmermann (2006), analysed a quarterly data set
comprising up to 43 time series for the G7 economies between 1959 and 1999, and found that the
out-of-sample mean square forecast error (MSFE) for the arithmetic mean forecast is about 10%
lower than the MSFE obtained by the best single model.
         Another positive effect may arise from the combination of filter outcomes, namely, the
higher degree of flexibility when facing structural breaks. Structural breaks are an important
question when decomposing a time series and their incidence is almost certain during long time
spans. Breaks can affect the stationarity of the series, introduce spurious correlations among its
points, and make the trend-cycle decomposition troublesome, thus affecting analyses that do not
account for this question.
         Typically, it is difﬁcult to timely detect structural breaks, but it is plausible that, on average,
combinations of filter outcomes with different degrees of adaptability to breaks will outperform
decompositions emerging from individual models. Some decomposition procedures have a more
oscillating trend that will be only temporally affected by the break, while others have a smoother
trend that will slowly adjust. As long as more data points are available after the break occurrence,
slow-adapting models will perform better than fast-adapting ones, since the parameters of the
former are more precisely estimated. On the other hand, if the data window from the most recent
break is short, fast-adapting models can be expected to produce the best trend-cycle representations
(see Pesaran and Timmermann, 2005). This intuition is easily expanded to the case where parameter
and model uncertainty are present. As long as the DGP is a mutable process, the best decomposition
model for a given economy will possibly change over time, in a sense that combining different filter
outcomes can make the decomposition components more robust against such misspeciﬁcation
errors.
         In short, the combination of filters is a way around the uncertainties arising from a complex
data generating process. As stated by Winkler (1989, p.606): “(…) in many situations there is no
such thing as a ‘true’ model for forecasting purposes. The world around us is continually changing,

    Here, these two analysts use their information when choosing the smoothness parameter.
                                                            3
with new uncertainties replacing old ones.” This insight implicitly assumes that one could not
identify the underlying process, but that different filtering procedures are able to capture various
aspects of the information contained in the time series, and produce more consistent business cycle
facts by using an averaging scheme.
        As said before, the λ parameter of the HP-filter controls the smoothness of the trend. In this
sense, we can benefit from its flexibility in order to mimic the trend and cycle components of other
filtering methods. An illustration may explain this statement. First, we simulate a time series model
as an autoregressive process taking the form yt = 0.2+0.99yt-1+εt, where εt is a Gaussian white noise.
Then, we decompose the latter time series by utilizing two extreme case procedures: the noisy BN-
ARIMA(2,1,0) filter, depicted in part “a” of Figure 1, below; and, the smooth third order
polynomial trend, illustrated in part “c” of the same graph. Next, we use the HP-filter trying to
replicate these two previous results. Part “b” shows the trend of a HP(λ=1)-filter, and part “d” a
HP(λ=960,000)-filter. As we can see, the HP-filter is a good approximation for both methods, and
by varying λ properly, one can reproduce an even larger range of filtering outcomes.
        Moreover, we save time when making use of this approach since it avoids subsequent, and
necessary, adjustments on the time series when averaging components from distinct trend-cycle
decomposition methods (see, e.g., Lamo, et al., 2013, who employ this alternative procedure).
        An extra detail should be noted with respect to the algorithm that averages the HP-filter
components. In order to extract the best results from such method, the degree of overlap
information between the series must be low. That is, the more new features are presented by the
different filtering outcomes, the more useful and general are the combined series (see the intuition
in Winkler, 1989). Nevertheless, the differences between two specific HP-filter outcomes decrease
as the smoothness parameter increases. A series implied by a λ=10,000, for example, is quite similar
to another obtained by setting a λ=11,000. Therefore, if the algorithm‟s step increases together with
λ, the method will provide averaged trend and cycle components that will hold richer information
about business cycle.

        In Table 1 we highlight some interesting values for λ, fetched by the calculations. First we
emphasize λ=1, number that leads to an extremely noisy trend component; next we have λ=960 and
1,120, which are closely related to the values suggested by Pedersen (2001); finally we utilize a
variety of other λ, including λ=1,600 and 14,440 as recommended by Hodrick and Prescott (1997)
for quarterly and monthly data, respectively, and λ=800,000, considered by Perron and Wada
(2009) for the quarterly U.S. real GDP data. In all, we implement 43 different types of HP-
decompositions that, on average, shall bear a good resemblance with the true Brazilian GDP‟s trend
and cycle components5.

3. Preliminary results: unit roots and decomposition evaluation
Perron (1989), in a seminal paper, brought light on the effects of structural breaks while analysing
unit roots in economic time series. One major problem with Perron‟s (1989) methodology, however,
is that he considers the breakdate as exogenous, i.e., known beforehand. Thus, one could choose the
breakpoint dates based on its prior observation of the time series, generating problems such data-
mining and the like. Zivot and Andrews (1992), instead, propose a test that circumvents this
problem, by estimating, rather than fixing, the breakpoint date. In this paper, we use their statistics,
as well as the Kwiatkowski, et al. (KPSS, 1992) tests. Table 2 shows the test results.

  When estimating λ from a model of local linear trend plus AR(2) cycle (Harvey and Trimbur, 2003), as the inverse of
signal-to-noise ratio, we found a value of 168. Thus, our algorithm also covers such estimated parameter.

assumptions. Consequently, all tests are confirming the existence of a unit root in the log-levels of
the Brazilian GDP data, even when one takes account to the possibility of one structural change.
        As the log-level of the Brazilian quarterly GDP is non-stationary around a stochastic trend,
we can turn our attentions to the decomposition components, since the HP-filter is able to remove
up to four unit roots of a given series (see, e.g., Baxter and King, 1999; and Pedersen, 2001).
        Figure 2, below, brings four series. First, part “a” shows the log-GDP time series with
CODACE recession dates illustrated in the shaded areas. Part “b” depicts our first average time
series, namely, our results for the Brazilian GDP long-term trend (solid line) and its two standard
error bands (dashed lines). Part “c” brings our mean cyclic series (solid line) and its two standard
error bands (dashed lines); and, part “d” illustrates the mean cyclic series with CODACE recession
dates in the shaded areas.

         By visually inspecting Figure 2, part “b”, one can clearly see a very smooth trend with a
flatter slope after the 1980s. In fact, this reduction was remarkable: Brazilian long-term trend is now
about 50% times less steep than it used to be before the mentioned year. According to Perron
(1989), this type of smooth stochastic trend is well-described as a unit root process with strong
mean-reversion and fat-tailed distribution for the error sequences. As a result, most of shocks have a
small, if any, long-term effect; only a few numbers of events can modify the trend permanently, as
in the case of the highly unstable period of 1980s, in which Brazil underwent a political regime
switching (military to democratic), and several years of hyperinflation.
         Parts “b” and “c” also show that the trend and cycle components are less accurately
calculated during the periods of 1965-1970, and 1974-1980. These periods may be associated with
many political and economic instabilities, such as the beginning of the Military Regime; a high and
increasing inflation (in 1964, Brazilian General Price Index - Internal Availability -reached a peak
of 92% per year, for the whole 1947-1979 period); the extended slowdown in the GDP growth rate
that Brazilian economy has passed through during 1963-1967, due to a large package of restrictive
                                                                               6
fiscal and monetary policies, aiming to control the soaring prices; an even longer period of high
growth, over the 1968-1973 period, also referred as the Economic Miracle, in which the real GDP
grew at a rate of 11% per year (Abreu, 1989); and, the break started around 1980.
        Such sources of uncertainties would have affected the usual trend-cycle decomposition
methods whenever it is assumed a particular specification for the filtering procedure. However, as
we argued before, the average series tends to be more robust to them, since different decomposition
outcomes can adapt faster to the vast complexity of the real world economic time series.
        In Figure 2, part “d”, we focus on the average cyclic series as well as on the CODACE
recession dates (the Brazilian committee provides us the business cycle chronology for the 1980-
2009 period), in which one can notice a high degree of matching between both series. Still, in order
to access an exact measure of their correspondence, we need to transform our cyclic series in a
binary indicator of the business cycle phases. For such, first, we find the turning point dates (peaks
and troughs), and, second, we create our own dummy series, defining expansions as the period from
a previous trough to the most recent peak, and recessions as the period from a previous peak to the
most recent trough.
        In order to find the turning points, we employ a simple rule created by Wecker (1979), and
also employed by Pagan (1997), among others, where a peak is equal 1 when {Δyc,t > 0; Δyc,t+1 < 0;
Δyc,t+2 < 0}, where yc,t refers to the average cyclic component. Conversely, a trough series is equal
to 1 when {Δyc,t < 0; Δyc,t+1 > 0; Δyc,t+2 > 0}. We also require that peaks and troughs alternate, so if
two or more peaks (troughs) are subsequent we select the one with a higher (smaller) value for yc.
Thus, the algorithm replicates a common view among media members and politicians that
expansions (recessions) involve at least two quarters of positive (negative) growth.
        Table 3 presents comparisons between our cyclic series and CODACE‟s business cycle
dates. This table also refers to the binary indicators for expansions and recessions, StE and StR ,
respectively, derived from our decomposition after applying Wecker‟s (1979) rule. In a total of 120
quarters, our dummy indicator has a correspondence rate of 86% ((79+24)/120) during expansions,
and 88% ((44+61)/120) in recessions.

        Moreover, while the errors in the course of expansions are quite similar, i.e., 8 cases in
which our cycle series indicates a false upswing, and 9 cases in which it misses a real one; during
recessions the average cyclic series misses only 4 in a total of 48 CODACE dates, i.e., a matching
of 92%. Finally, it shall be noted that both series, StR and CODACE, are perfectly coordinated
during the 1989:02-1992:01, 2002:01-2003:02 and 2008:03-2009:01 recessions.
        In order to compare the performance of our method, we show below, in Table 4,
correspondence rates of other four different methods, using the same Wecker‟s (1979) rule. The
alternative decomposition methods considered are: a) the classical HP(λ=1600)-filter; b) an
ARIMA(1,1,1)-BN filter; c) the Baxter and King (1999) band pass filter, assuming that business
cycles lasts from 1.5 to 8 years; and, d) the unobservable components decomposition, considering
that the cyclic component behaves as an AR(2), process (that is, the UC(2) model).

         As can be seen in Table 4, our averaged decomposition outperforms all the other methods,
especially when it comes to expansions. Including, we have gotten qualitative gains even when
comparing with the classical HP-filter, the second best option. It is important to note that if one had
means to check methods‟ performance between 1965 and 1980, a period with large filtering
instability, as Figure 2 shows, is possible to think that our method could have obtained even better
results.

4. Features of Brazilian cyclic component from 1947 to 2012
In order to examine features of the Brazilian business cycle, we divide the sample into four distinct
subsamples, namely, the years before the Military Regime, 1947-1963; the Military Regime itself,
1964-1984; the Democratic period before the Real Plan, 1985-1993; and the Real Plan period itself,
1994-2012. It is a natural way to divide a sample in Brazil, since it takes into account the several
changes in the political field. However, we relax this assumption later.
       In Table 5, which brings patterns of the business cycle phases, the average duration, a
measure of the phase length, is calculated using the formula Dˆ i  1/(1  ˆ i  ˆ i ) , where i = E, R,
meaning expansions and recessions, respectively. In this case, parameters are obtained by the OLS
regression Sti   i   i Sti1 , where i = E, R, and StE and StR represent the same binary variables
analysed in Section 3. By its turn, the average range during the business cycle phases, Âi, is
estimated as the slope of the linear regressions between ΔGDPt and Sti , and indicates the height of
expansions or the depth of recessions, in a given period of time. Having the mean duration and
range, total gains and losses of the business cycle phases follow directly by using the triangle
approximation, CTi=0.5( D̂ i *Âi), where CTi refers to the cumulative movements inside a cycle‟s
phase (aforementioned calculations follow Harding and Pagan, 2002).

      Expansions in Brazil last for approximately eight quarters, or two years, and recessions have
a mean duration of six quarters, or 1.5 years. The three longest expansions occurred from 1956:02
to 1961:02, related to the “Plano de Metas”, a consistent and comprehensive plan of public

investments; from 1967:01 to 1971:01 and 1971:04 to 1973:04, related to the Brazilian Economic
Miracle period; and from 2003:02 to 2008:03, which was interrupted by the Great Recession.
        On the other hand, the three longest recessions occurred from 1950:01 to 1953:02, related
with unbalanced public accounts and a cambial crisis started around 1952; and the periods of
1981:01-1983:04, and 1989:02-1992:01, where political and economic instabilities led to
hyperinflation, and negative growth (Brazilian GDP reduced -4.25 in 1981, -2.93 in 1983, -0.06% in
1988, -4.35% in 1990, and -0.47% in 1992, according data from the Brazilian System of National
Accounts, IBGE)6. After that, 2009 was the only year in which Brazilian economy presented a
negative growth, with -0.33% of variation in its GDP.
        By closely inspecting Table 5, one can note that, while the business cycle phases change
across the subsamples, the duration of a full cycle is quite constant, around 3.5 years, i.e., 14
quarters. Another interesting fact is that the duration of expansions are longer than that of
recessions, even during the 1980s. Additionally, total gains are always higher than total losses,
depicting a manifested asymmetry between the business cycle phases in the country. Besides, after
the Real Plan, Brazilian economy has had milder expansions and recessions (see total gain and loss,
in Table 5), which shows some evidence of increased stability in the country since the mid-1990s.
        Persistence7, by its turn, has been quite stable in Brazil, usually oscillating around the 0.7-
0.8 bands, as can be seen in Table 6. However, during some recessions, such as those occurred in
1989:02-1992:01, 1997:04-1999:01 and 2008:03-2009:01, the cyclic series correlation has a
tendency to reduce, probably due to a higher degree of uncertainty (as depicted by Figure 3, part
“c”, below).

        Taking a closer look into the stability question, Table 6 shows that Brazilian volatility,
measured as the standard deviation of the cyclic series, has surely decreased after 1994. In fact, the
quarterly volatility after this year is less than half of that observed during the 1964-1984 period, and
about 40% lower than its full sample value. In order to make international comparisons, we can
reproduce statistics calculated by Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) for a set of developed countries, who
found standard deviations in the order of 1.39% for Australia, 1.64% for Canada, 2.18% for
Finland, 1.52% for Sweden, and 1.34% overall, between 1980 and 2003. Thus, our results indicate
that Brazilian volatility has been converging to a number comparable to those estimated in some
developed countries.
        Figure 3, below, provides additional information about Brazilian business cycles. In that
figure, we estimate moving standard deviation, variance, and persistence of our cyclic series using a
14-quarter window, which is the same average duration of a full cycle, besides the GDP 14-quarter
mean growth-rate. These time series are depicted in parts “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d”, respectively.
        As one can see, parts “a” and “b” of Figure 3 confirm that Brazilian instability has decreased
since mid-1990s. Moreover, during periods of recessions, standard deviation and variance tend to
increase, but after the mentioned period, peaks of volatility are consistently lower than the previous
one (the only exception is the last international crises peak). In this sense, all the evidence reported
so far seems to support the incidence of a delayed great moderation in Brazil, in lines with that
found by several authors for the U.S. economy (see, e.g., McConnell and Perez-Quiros, 2000; and
Stock and Watson, 2002).

    Persistence is defined as the first autoregressive coefficient of the cyclic component as in Pivetta and Reis (2007).
                                                               9
         According to Stock and Watson (2002), there are generally three main explanations for this
phenomenon. The first one is related with structural changes that might have affected the economy;
for example, the shift in output from goods to services (Zarnowitz and Moore, 1986), improvements
in the inventory management made possible by the advancements in information-technology
(McConnell and Perez-Quiros, 2000), and financial innovations that facilitates intertemporal
smoothing of consumption and investment (Blanchard and Simon, 2001). The second reason would
be improved monetary policy (e.g., Cogley and Sargent, 2005). And the third category is good luck,
that is, a number of exogenous shocks that reduced U.S. volatility (Leeper and Zha 2003; Sims and
Zha 2006). However, a consistent investigation of this question, applied to the Brazilian case, is
beyond the objectives of the present paper. Here we focus on the mapping of the business cycles
facts, providing information that can be utilized in future research.
         Additional information is found in Figure 3, part “d”. In the full sample, Brazilian economy
has had 14 quarters of negative growth. The historical growth-rate peak was found in 1973:04,
which equals to 3.09% per quarter, while the lowest value occurred in 1983:03, equalling to –0.42%
per quarter. Before the 1980s, the 14-quarter growth rate of the GDP was swinging around 2% per
quarter, a value closer to that believed as being the Brazilian natural growth-rate up to this year,
which equals to 7% per year, as pointed out in many sections of Abreu‟s book (1989, p.222, for
instance). Since then, the Brazilian‟s GDP long-term growth-rate seems to have converged to half
of this value, about 1% per quarter.

4.1. Robustness tests on the decreased volatility and structural change tests
In this subsection, we seek to investigate further questions regarding the reduction of the Brazilian
instability, since this is an interesting feature, also found in other countries that had not yet been
detected by previous papers. Specifically, we intend to examine if this finding is robust to changes
in the volatility measure, and when it has really happened.
        Table 7 brings a variety of proxies for the volatility in the country. The first three series
(“Δgdp variance (i)”, i = 4, 8, 14) refer to the variance of the GDP log growth-rate considering 4, 8
and 14 quarters moving windows, respectively. Next, two classical measures of instability are
                                                                                    10
presented, i.e., the absolute and the squared returns. Table 7 also shows the one step ahead forecasts
of the conditional variance emerging from an ARIMA(7,1,0)-Garch(1,1) model for the log-GDP
time series, and an ARIMA(5,1,0)-Garch(1,1) model for the mean HP-cycle. Both specifications
were chosen according to the Akaike (1987) information criteria, where, for the sake of simplicity,
we assume normally distributed disturbances. Finally, we present, within parenthesis, the classical
Student‟s t and Welch‟s (1951) statistics for the null that the estimated volatility in a certain period
is equal to that found after 1994. Welch (1951) test considers the possibility of different variances
across subsamples8.

        The first pattern seen in Table 7 is that volatility increased from 1947 to 1993 and then, after
1994, it fell to lower levels. On average, the instability of the 1994-2012 years is 28% lower than
that observed during 1947-1963; 41% lower than that under the Military regime; and, 63% lower
than the volatility of the 1985-1993 years. The major difference across periods was measured by the
variance of the growth rate within one year moving window, an approximation for the short-run
volatility (Δgdp variance, 4 quarters). According to this proxy, instability has decreased about 40,
70 and 230% in the Real Plan, comparatively to the pre-1964, Military and 1985-1993 periods, in
that order. Conversely, the minor differences were estimated by the Garch(1,1)-GDP proxy,
wherein the instability after 1994 has decreased 7, 21, and 64%, relatively to the periods in the same
order as before. A second feature is that the period from 1985 to 1993, in which inflation levels
were extremely high, was the most unstable in the Brazilian history, for nearly all volatility

        Throughout this paper, we have assumed a fairly logical division in the data set, beginning
with pre-Military period, then the Military regime itself, passing through the 1980s and, finally, the
Real Plan‟s years. It seems to be a natural assumption, given the recent political history of the
country. Nonetheless, statistically, this type of a priori division of the sample makes the breakdate
endogenous (correlated with the data), and tests are likely to falsely indicate a break, when none in
fact exists (Hansen, 2001).
        In order to circumvent this difficulty, we apply three different classes of methods, which are
the Nyblom‟s L test of structural changes with unknown breakdate (Hansen, 1992), the Quandt

undetermined values for volatility.

(1960)-Andrews (1993) procedure, and the Hansen (2001) tests. The first one evaluates a structural
change in all the parameters of a model, without assuming a specific date, but it does not provide an
estimated date of change. The Quandt (1960)-Andrews (1993) and Hansen (2001) methodologies,
however, do estimate a breakpoint date, besides providing complementary pieces of information.
         When computing Nyblom‟s L test, we follow Hansen (1992) and McConnell and Perez-
Quiros (2000), assuming that the Brazilian GDP log-growth rates behave according an AR(1)
process with a drift. It is a simple yet powerful model, as showed by Hess and Iwata (1997).
Proceeding in this way, we are able to test for breaks in the mean, in the autoregressive coefficient
and in the variance of the time series (μ, ϕ, σ2), which are associated, respectively, to structural
changes in the trend, persistence and volatility of the GDP. Hansen (1992) provides two types of
statistics, one for testing the stability of each parameter individually, and other for testing the
stability of all parameters jointly. Both are presented in Table 8, below.

        In Table 8, results are presented in five panels; from “a” to “e”, in which Nyblom‟s tests are
applied to different samples. First, Panel (a) shows the method for the whole data set. In this case,
the estimation shows a clear break in the trend, with a calculated statistics of 1.27 that can be
compared to the critical values of 0.47 (5%), or 0.35 (10%). Besides, we cannot find a significant

break in the autoregressive parameter, and the variance presents a break only considering a critical
value of 10%.
        As presented in Table 8, if the sample is divided in decades, the volatility drop is clear, with
the L statistic reaching a peak of 0.97 during the 1980s, and 0.94 after the 1990s. Besides, as long as
we move in the sample, the structural change in the mean term, μ, disappears after 1980, which
indicates that the break occurred around this year.
        Results from this table for the autoregressive parameter are mixed, and it may not have
suffered a major change during the period of the analysis of the sample, as shown in Table 8, Panel
(a), Table 6 and Figure 3.
        Hansen (1992) tests are informative and have a solid statistical basis, but they lack
information regarding the timing of the breaks. In this sense, we apply two other tests, the first one
due to Quandt (1960) and Andrews (1993, henceforth Quandt-Andrews), and the second one to
Hansen (2001). Here we present the Quandt-Andrews test first, since Hansen (2001) utilizes some
of its concepts.
        The Quandt-Andrews method tests one or more unknown structural breakpoints in the
sample for a specified equation. Quandt (1960) proposed a method that calculates Chow‟s statistics
for every point of the sample between two dates, say, t1 and t210. Through this search procedure, the
breakdate can be found either using the maximum of the Chow‟s statistics (the original Quandt‟s
test), or the exponential and average statistics, for which Andrews (1993) and Andrews and
Ploberger (1994) calculated tables of critical values, while Hansen (1997) provided approximate
asymptotic p-values. In this research work, we use the maximum and the exponential statistics,
standard in the literature, denoted by MaxF and ExpF, respectively.
        When applying Quandt-Andrews tests, we assume two specifications, one for breaks in the
AR(1) model, Δgdpt = μ + ϕ Δgdpt-1 + εt, which tests for breaks in μ and ϕ, and other for breaks in
volatility,  t2, proxy     t , where the dependent variable is one of the proxies for the Brazilian
instability listed below; κ is a parameter that refers to the average volatility; and, υ t is an error term.
The positive point about this approach it that it allows testing for breaks in a vast number of
instability indicators.
        The volatility proxies considered here are: moving variance cycle (i), with i = 4, 8, 14,
denoting the variance of the mean cyclic series using moving windows of 4, 8, and 14 quarters;
Δgdp variance (i), with i = 4, 8, 14, absolute returns, squared returns, and one step ahead forecasts
of the conditional variance emerging from GARCH models are defined as before.
        Finally, Hasen‟s (2001) test integrates both Hansen (1992) and Quandt-Andrews
methodologies in a single framework. Assuming, again, an AR(1) process for the Brazilian GDP
log-growth rates, Hansen (2001) procedure estimates and tests the time of a break occurrence for
the full set of parameters (i.e., the OLS estimates for μ, ϕ and σ2) by means of the maximum and
exponential statistics. The results of Quandt-Andrews and Hansen (2001) tests are presented in
Table 9, below.
        Beginning with the break on the mean growth-rate of the process, μ, Table 9 shows that
Quandt-Andrews method estimates it in the second quarter of 1980, while Hansen (2001) estimates
a break in the first quarter of the same year. Besides, MaxF and ExpF Wald statistics for both
methods are highly significant. In this sense, based on the findings of the trend-cycle
decomposition, and on these results, one can be quite sure about the timing of the break on the
trend: the first semester of 1980. The GDP‟s log-growth rate was estimated at 1.8% per quarter,
before 1980, and 0.7% after that year, which is similar to the results found in Section 3. The
evidence reported here agrees, therefore, with the Lost Decade view, which has imposed to the
Brazilian economy a permanent slowdown in its rate of growth.
        With respect to the autoregressive coefficient, Table 9 Panel (b) confirms our previous
expectations, showing that at 10% of significance we cannot reject the null hypothesis of constancy

  Andrews‟ (1993) statistics diverge to infinity in probability if one uses them to the full sample. Thus, following his
suggestions, we exclude from the analysis the first and the last 7.5% of the observations.
                                                          13
in the ϕ parameter. Specifically, MaxF statistic was calculated as 7.24, with a p-value of 14%, while
ExpF was calculated as 1.37, with a p-value of 12%. By reviewing Tables 6 and 8, Panel (a), we are
able to reach the same conclusion.
        Now, we shall turn attention to the volatility question. In Table 9, Panel (a), almost all short-
term volatility measures, namely, Moving var. cycle (4), Δgdp variance (4), Garch(1,1)-GDP, and
Garch(1,1)-HP-cycle estimate one break around the years 1996 or 1997. This result is confirmed by
the Hansen (2001) test in Panel (b), which estimates a break in 1996:04. All statistics are highly
significant. The long-term instability measures, Moving var. cycle (8), Moving var. cycle (14),
Δgdp variance (8), and Δgdp variance (14), by construction, postpone the timing of the break by few
quarters.

        Two series disagree with this timing, estimating 1991:02 as the breakpoint; they are the
squared returns, and the absolute returns. Nevertheless, these series seem to be an exception to the
other findings, in a sense that we can be quite sure about a break around 1996 and 199711.
        Next, we analyse the possibility of multiple structural changes in the Brazilian output
volatility. When doing so, Bai and Perron (1998) procedure is employed. This method searches for
breaks successively, aiming to reduce the regression‟s sum of squared residuals. Whenever a
breakdate is identified, data is split and another break is assessed inside the smaller samples. The
algorithm stops at a number of, say, l breaks, which minimizes some information measure (here, the
Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC, is utilized). Trimming parameter is set at 15%, as usual.
Results are shown in Table 10.

     With 1996/1997 as the breakdate, the estimated reduction in the volatility is 50% on average.

        According to Table 10, most of the considered volatility proxies present two structural
breaks (here we focus on short term proxies). The only exceptions are absolute and squared returns,
in which, in both cases, only one breakpoint was detected (1991:01). The remaining variables
indicate that Brazilian instability has an interesting inverted U-shape pattern, peaking in the period
from 1980, or 1985, to the first half of the 1990‟s. Moreover, regarding dates of the last break,
results in this table are consistent with the evidence previously presented, in which we estimate a
regime of lower volatility beginning around 1996 or 1997.
        Finally, Figure 4, below, displays the moving standard deviations of the HP-cyclic time
series, when using only the 1990-2012 sample, part “a”, and the 1994-2012 sample, part “b”. In this
figure, we compute the moving standard deviation, using, again, moving windows of four, eight,
and 14-quarter-long, respectively.

       Our data show that, after the last break, Brazilian instability has become cyclic and has
presented phases of higher volatility in recessions, which is the case of the first three quarters of
1995, when the economy was adjusting to the new monetary and fiscal scenario, and during the
Great Recession; and phases of lower volatility. Besides, although the Great Recessions did not
have the same impact on Brazilian instability as the crises of the 1980s, their effects were quite
relevant in the post 1990s conjuncture.

5. Conclusions
The present work aimed to provide new facts about the Brazilian business cycle during the period of
1947 and 2012. Therefore, we have decomposed the quarterly and seasonally adjusted real GDP
into its mean trend and cycle components, by estimating and averaging on a variety of HP-filter

                                                                                   15
outcomes. In this sense, we provide many pieces of information which can be utilized in other
models and studies.
        Our main findings are the following: i) the model has almost matched the CODACE
business cycle dates, with a correspondence of 88% and 86% during recessions and expansions,
respectively; ii) the estimated trend component is noticeably flatter after the 1980s, depicting a
major structural break that happened in that period, also known as the “lost decade”; iii) there is
strong evidence that volatility decreased in the country (for example, we found significant structural
breaks which occurred around 1996/97); iv) the persistence of the cyclic series tends to oscillate
between the 0.7-0.8 bands; v) the business cycle phases have a different duration in the full sample,
with expansions and recessions lasting for, respectively, 8 and 6 quarters on average, which implies
a full cycle of 3.5 years; however, during the Military Regime, Brazilian economy presented mean
expansions about 80% longer than recessions; and, vi) the mean growth rates of the phases are quite
different, reaching a value of 1.7% per quarter (or 6.8% per year) during expansions, and 0.45% per
quarter (or 1.8% per year) during slowdowns; however, between 1985 and 1993, the mean growth
rate during recessions was around -0.2% per quarter, i.e., -0.8% per year.
        The results described above are wide-ranging. For example, we found that the Brazilian
business cycles are asymmetric, with expansions exhibiting longer duration and accumulated
movements than recessions. These asymmetries across business cycle phases are also observed in
the OECD countries, as documented in Chang and Hwang (2011), and Chauvet and Yu (2006).
Moreover, we found that the Brazilian long-term trend is reasonably similar to that described by
Perron and Wada (2009) for the U.S. economy, except that, for the latter, the major break occurred
in 1973. Our expansion and recession growth rates are also parallel to those obtained by Chauvet
(2002).
        All these regularities, namely, phase asymmetries and a decreased volatility over the time,
are also observed in the OECD countries, in a sense that Brazilian business cycle, although delayed
(and contrary to the evidence reported by previous papers), does share central qualitative features
with other decentralized market economies.
        Specifically to the volatility reduction, it shall be clear that the present paper concluded that
it happened after the Real Plan implementation. We are not stating, however, that the Real Plan was
the only or the most important source of such phenomenon. As we discussed before, the strand of
literature investigating on this issue usually finds that changes in the private sector, in the monetary
policy conduction, and in the size of the shocks hitting the economies can, each one of them, be
responsible for the structural break in the variance. Thus, we leave this topic for future research.
