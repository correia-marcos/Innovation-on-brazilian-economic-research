      This article studies the impacts of malnutrition on labor productivity, analyzing the Nutrition-
Based Poverty Trap (NPT). We verify the effects of micronutrient and calorie intake (iron and
vitamins A, B1 and B2) on the incomes of household heads for the agricultural, non-agricultural,
independent and other employments sectors. We applied a variation of the Durbin and McFadden
(1984) methods for the correction of the selection bias based on the multinomial logit data, obtained
from the Family Budget Research/IBGE carried out from 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 in rural Brazil.
Results suggest that although micronutrient deficiencies still persist as a public health problem in
Brazil, there was an improvement during the analyzed period of time.

1 INTRODUCTION

       A considerable amount of the recent literature on economic development has been concerned
about wellbeing determinants included in the millennium goals. One of the key elements to comply
with such goals is the reduction of malnutrition. With this perspective, the main proposal of this
study is to investigate the impacts of malnutrition on labor productivity in densely populated
countries, where labor demand is often lower than labor offer. As a consequence, the lack of
opportunities in the labor market results in low wages. In this context, the poor are doubly affected:
they don´t receive any profits from assets, as they don´t have them, and they also have a restricted
access to working opportunities.
       Micronutrients and wage categories may suggest that a policy aimed at increasing nutritional
intake by the malnourished population sector may lead to a growth in salary revenues. This would
demonstrate the importance of a policy to grant nutritional supplements to the deprived population.
The crucial question to be answered is if an improvement in nutrient intake could have any
significant effects on rural income and therefore, on the possibility to break this trap, as well as on
the reduction of poverty in rural Brazil. Consequently, the main focus of the public policies should
be on raising awareness on nutritional implications. This would highlight the importance of a direct
nutritional supplements policy, besides the inclusion of policies to directly reduce poverty.
       The effects of nutritional intake on labor productivity and on wage levels have been an
important research area for health economists and nutritionists. The hypothesis of efficient wages
shows that in developing countries such as Brazil, which suffer from particularly low nutritional
levels, workers are physically incapable of performing hard physical work, which results in low
productivity and low wages, low purchase power and consequently, low nutritional levels,
completing a vicious cycle of misery. This cycle also diminishes the chances of these workers to
escape the Nutrition-Based Poverty Trap. (NPT).
       Among the papers that empirically test the existence of a NPT we can mention those of
Strauss (1986), Thomas and Strauss (1997), Deolalik (1988), Barret (2002) and Jha, Gaiha and
Sharma (2009). There are also other studies that analyze the effects of micronutrient and calorie
deficiency in workers’ productivity, such as Stamoulis, Pingaly and Shetty in 2004. As for the
national production however, there is no economics literature on the importance of quantifying
micronutrient and calorie deficiency in the nutrition-based poverty trap development and
consequently on the impact of this deprivation in labor productivity. With this in mind, this article
aims mainly at analyzing the poverty trap with regards to nutrition, verifying the effect of
micronutrients intake (iron and vitamins A, B1 and B2) and calories on the income of family heads.
Seeking to comply with these goals, we apply a variation o the Durbin –Mcfadden method (1984) to
correct the selection bias based on multinomial logit models, in agreement with Bourguignon,
Fournier and Gurgand (2004). The main goal is to foresee the probabilities of an individual to
participate in the labor market and use them as income determinants to verify the existence of the
nutrition-based poverty trap (NPT). The database is created based on the Family Budget Research
(FBD) 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 for rural Brazil.
       The rest of this paper is organized in seven sections. Sections 2 and 3 review specialized
literature on nutrition deprivation and on the nutrition-based poverty trap. The fourth section
introduces a methodology that corrects the selection bias problem based on multinomial logit
models. The fifth section introduces the database and the econometric models to be estimated. The
sixth and seventh sections analyze estimated results and draw the final conclusions.
2 THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL ASPECTS OF NUTRITIONAL DEPRIVATION
AND THE NUTRITION-BASED POVERTY TRAP

       The pioneering works that relate wages, nutrition and productivity at work expressed by the
initial hypothesis of an efficiency wage were developed by Leibenstein (1957), Mirrlees (1975) and
Stiglitz (1976) among others. They advocate that productivity has a non-linear dependency on
nutrition and that an increase in worker calorie intake generates marginal productivity gains and
consequently, higher wages.
       The hypothesis of efficiency wage models based on nutrition according to Mirrleees (1975) is
that high wages may increase worker productivity as with higher wages, they may buy more food,
becoming better nourished and therefore, more productive at work.
       According to Leibenstein (1957), worker productivity is determined by the salary, as it
enables for the purchase of food, which supplies the energy that allows the worker to become more
productive at work. With this same perspective, Stiglitz’s theoretical essay (1976) describes the
productivity dependence of workers on the nutritional contents of their eating habits, which means
that the consumption of more nutritive foods has a positive impact on productivity and therefore, on
wages. On the other hand, the study developed by Ahmed et al (2007) corroborated that there was a
significant reduction in calorie deprivation in India from 1997 to 2003.
       There is a specific international literature that empirically tests the existence of the NPT.
Using data from rural families in Sierra Leone, from May 1974 to April 1975, Strauss (1986)
quantified the effects of nutritional patterns measured through the caloric intake in the annual
agricultural production and in the labor productivity. He found that calorie intake had significant
and important effects on the agricultural production. He concluded that an adequate calorie intake
exerted a positive correlation with family productivity.
       In a research based on the impact of four health indicators (height, body mass index, calorie
intake per capita and protein intake) developed for Brazilian workers’ wages in urban areas,
Thomas and Strauss (1997) using a database provided by the National Studies on Family Expenses
(ENDEF) between August 1974 and August 1975, verified that these four indicators had a positive
and significant effect on wages. Such fact was due to an improvement in the health and nutrition
situation of the urban poor.
       Contrary to this however, Deolalik (1988) applying a regression panel data of fixed effects of
an adequacy of wages and rural agricultural production in Southern India from 1976 to 1978,
discovered that calorie intake does not affect wages or productivity, suggesting that the human body
can adapt to short-term calorie intake deficits. However, he found out that height and weight does
affect wages and productivity and that such results suggest that malnutrition is an important
determinant of productivity and wages.
       By analyzing rural data from India from 1966 to 1969, Swamy (1997) proved that wages
based on the efficiency wage modes based on nutrition are rigid, as when they decrease they also
reduce the workers activity and increase the cost per labor efficiency unit. In a theoretical study,
Barret (2002) discovered that micronutrient deficiency reduces physical and cognitive activity, thus
affecting work productivity. Such deficiency also indirectly decreases productivity by increasing
worker susceptibility to disease and infections.
        Using data from the World Bank from 1994 to 1996, Horton and Ross (2003) showed that
iron deficiency in ten developing countries such as Honduras, Bangladesh, Nicaragua and Bolivia
among others is related to a number of functional consequences with economic implications, such
as mental deterioration in children and low productivity in adult work. Likewise, Lorch (2001)
proved that vitamin A deficiency (carotene) is a serious malnutrition that weakens the immunologic
system and may lead to blindness.
       Micronutrient deficiency may also provoke a deep impact on worker productivity and
performance, as advocated by the study developed by Lukaski (2004). Specifically, a deficiency in
Vitamin B may cause weakness, reduced stamina, loss of weight and body mass, whereas a
deficiency in vitamin B2 may lead to alterations in the skin, the mucous membrane and the nervous
system. Vitamin A deficiency may cause loss of appetite and increased susceptibility to infections
while iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia, cognitive deterioration and abnormalities in the
immunologic system. Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of micronutrient and calorie
deficiency in workers’ productivity, in which the specialized literature has been focused on.
(LAKDAWALLA, PHILIPSON and BHATTACHARYA, 2005).
       In an analysis of micronutrient deficiency, Lakdawalla, Philipson, and Bhattacharya (2005)
adopted data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES) which
contains demographic features, laboratorial analysis with blood samples and nutritional information
collected from families from 1988 to 1994 in the USA. They estimated linear probability models
and discovered that nutritional deficiencies (vitamins A and C, folic acid and anemia) vary
according to food prices, as lower costs improve nutrition and obesity is the adverse effect of
economic growth.
       The existent gap in specialized literature on nutrition, poverty and wages is the negligence of
the impact of micronutrient deprivation on labor productivity, in other words, the possibility of the
existence of NPT related to micronutrient deficiency. An important contribution in this sense was
made by Weinberg (2003) who adopted the two-stage least square estimation method (2SLS) and
analyzed the impact of iron deficiency in labor productivity in rural India from July 1992 to June
1994. However, this author does not model the impact of micronutrient deficiency applying the
nutrition-based poverty trap.
       Seeking to fill that gap, Jha, Gaiha and Sharma (2009) tested the existence of the nutrition-
based poverty trap (NPT) for four micronutrients and calorie intake (carotene, iron, riboflavin and
thiamine) for rural India from January to June 1994 for three different wage levels (plantation,
harvest and others) in male and female workers. They used the Heckman sample (1976, 1979) and
verified the existence of NPT in ten cases, which proves that micronutrient deficiency has a
significant impact on agricultural worker productivity, mainly on females.
       In the national literature we should highlight Castro’s work (1932.1946) as one of the
pioneers in the topic of hunger, poverty, malnutrition and infant mortality, as he analyzed nutrition
needs based on data on the metabolism of the Brazilian population.
       The referred author performed an economics study on nutrition patterns of the Recife working
class, highlighting the living conditions of this population sector, which are narrated in his book The
Physiological Problem of Nutrition in Brazil (1932). He concluded that most workers lived in
famine and died of hunger, as the wages they were paid were insufficient to select food according to
the calories they provide and the amount they needed. In his work The Geography of Famine
(1946), the referred author introduced the problem of malnutrition and feeding deficiency by
demonstrating that Brazilians suffered from nutritional deficiency (in proteins, mineral salts and
vitamins) diversified in the most widespread areas of the national territory.
       At a national level, there is no economics literature on the importance of quantifying the
micronutrient and calorie deficiency and the progress of the nutrition-based poverty trap and
consequently, the impact of such deprivation on labor productivity. This paper seeks to fill that gap.

3 NUTRITION-BASED POVERTY TRAP

       The capacity curve is related to the labor capacity an individual can achieve for a given task
and the quantity of energy necessary to perform a certain task. The stylized version of the relation
between labor capacity and nutrition, according to Jha, Gaiha and Sharma (2009) is shown in Figure
1. It is assumed that income is a synonym of nutrition in the sense that all income is converted into
nutrition, which means that the money earned by the poor is entirely spent on food.

                           Source: Jha, Gaiha and Sharma (2009)


      For much lower income levels, all the energy from food intake goes to the resting
metabolism, which is the minimum calorie quantity that the body needs to keep working properly
(breathing, body temperature, etc). According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) data
from 2001, the minimum amount of energy for a Brazilian “reference man” with a weight of 65
kilos would be of 1,900 kcal per person a day. During this stage, little energy is allocated to work,
so the capacity curve in this area is next to zero. When the resting metabolism is filled, the
additional energy is sent to fill the energy required to perform physical work. As from a certain
income level, the labor capacity quickly improves due to the growth in the required energy to
perform work.
      When all the human body energy obtained from food intake is satisfied, the capacity to work
increases at decreasing rates, due to the natural limit imposed by the human body. In other words,
for very low income levels, we have the well- known decreasing scale returns factor. The non-linear
graphic represented by a convex and a concave region represents the possibility of the existence of
involuntary unemployment and the consequent persistence of poverty.
      The labor market is a mechanism of income and opportunity generation to acquire good
health and nutrition. According to Dadgupta and Ray (1986) the labor market movement can be
affected by a malnutrition problem, as it affects the capacity of the human body to perform tasks
that generate income. Poverty may lead to malnutrition and the latter provokes low productivity.
Consequently, a large part of the population may be prisoner of a poverty trap due to the
malnutrition problem.

4 SELECTION BIAS CORRECTIONS BASED ON MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODELS

Among the different sample selection modalities, there is one that appears when the dependent
variable is observed solely for a defined population subgroup such as the income variable that is
only noticed in individuals with a strictly positive labor day. In the simplest cases, in which the
observation of the variable of interest is determined by a binary variable, the problem of
endogenous selection may be easily solved through the procedure proposed by Heckman (1979)
which consists of a two-stage regression on the system:
                                 y1  x1 1  u1                           (1a)
                                 y 2  1x 2 2  v 2  0                        (1b)
In which (1a) is the equation that explains the variable of interest with regards to a vector of
observable behavior x1 and a disturbance u1 , called structural equation; (1b) is the equation that
explains the binary variable y 2 through the observable behavior vector x 2 and the non-observable
characteristics v 2 , called selection equation; ( x1 , x 2 ) are always observable and the variable y1 is
only observed when y 2  1.
      According to Heckman (1979), consistent estimators for  1 and  1 may be obtained through
the regression of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) of y i1 on x i1 and ˆ   x , ˆ , being the last one   i2   2   
an estimator of  2 obtained through the previous estimation of a probit for (1b), in which   is the
                                             x 2 2  1
inverse Mills ratio such that  x2 2                  ,
                                             x 2 2 
       In more complex models however, the selection takes place through a discrete choice
multinomial process. According to Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2004), the configuration
problem is as follows:
                                  y1  x1  u1                              (2a)
                                  y j  z j   j , ,
                                   *
                                                            j = 1. 2...., M  (2b)
Where disturbances u1 satisfy Eu1 x, z   0 and V u1 x, z    2 ; j represents a category variable
that describes the agent choice among the M alternatives based on “utilities” y *j o; vectors z and x
contain the variables that explain alternatives and the variable of interest respectively, without loss
of generality. It is assumed that the variable y1 is observed only if the category 1 is selected, which
happens when            y1*  max y *j . This condition equals to  1  0          if we define
                                       j 1

 1  max y  y   max z j   j  z 1  1  . As demonstrated by McFadden (1973) and
                 *
                 j
                        *
                        1
          j 1                  j 1

assuming that  j  are independent and identically distributed through the Gumbel distribution, this
specification leads to the multinomial logit model, with the response probability
                 exp( z 1 )
P 1  0 z  
                 j exp z j 
                                .

        Therefore, based on the above equation, consistent estimators for  j  ’s may be easily
obtained through maximum likelihood. However, the problem continues to be how to estimate the
vector for  1 parameters, considering that disturbances u1 may not be independent from all the  j 
’s, in such a way that this may introduce some correlation among explanatory variables and the
disturbances term in the equation of interest (2nd). Consequently, OLS estimators for  1 are
inconsistent.
       Generalizing on the Heckman process (1979), Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2004)
demonstrated that the selection bias correction may be based on the u1 conditional median such that
                         0 u f u , 
                                      1 

                                           d 1 du1     , where,   z 1 , z 2 ,..., z M  and f u1 ,  1 
                           P  0  
                                1

is the joint conditional density of u1 and  1 .
       They also concluded that as relations among the M components of Γ and the corresponding M
probabilities may be inverted, there is an unique μ function that may be replaced by λ in such a way
that Eu1  1  0,    P1 ,..., PM  .
       Thus, consistent estimators for  1 may be obtained through one of the two following
regressions: y1  x1 1   P1 ,..., PM   w1 ou y1  x1 1     w1 where w1 is the independent
residual of the average regression.
       However, as the estimation of a large number of parameters becomes necessary when we have
a vast choice of alternatives, restrictions on  P1 ,..., PM  or likewise, on λ(Γ), must be imposed in
order to keep the problem within control and it is exactly in that respect that bias correction
methods proposed in literature differ.

multinomial       logit      model,        Durbin            and        McFadden           (1984)     obtained that

        When analyzing such procedure, Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2004) noticed that the
hypothesis (3) imposed a specific kind of linearity between entre u1 and the Gumbel distributions of
 j ’s, thus restricting the distribution types permitted for u1 . They suggested a hypothesis
variation that could turn u1 linear in a set of normal distributions, allowing u1 to be normal with:

      By applying Monte-Carlo experiments to compare bias correction methods performances
based on multinomial logit models (MLM), the authors verified that most of the times the method
proposed by Dubin and McFadden (1984) was preferable to both the most commonly used Lee
method (1983), and to the semi-parametric alternative proposed by Dahl (2002). Experiments
showed that the Durbin - McFadden performance model (1984) is fairly sensitive to the imposed
normalization restriction and that the suggested variation, however usually less robust than the
original version, boasts higher performance when the normalization hypothesis is violated. Besides,
it seems to be more capable of capturing intensely non-linear selection terms. Finally, through

5 DATABASE DESCRIPTIONS AND ANALYSIS

      The database used was the Family Budget Research (FBR) 2002-2003 and 2008-2009
supplied by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) for all rural Brazil states. From
this database, variables related to the category “family reference person”, who corresponds to the
household head, were obtained. The variable average rainfall was built based on information
provided by INMET (National Meteorology Institute).
      Initially, we use a multinomial logit model in which the dependent and explanatory variables
are discriminated in Chart 1. This model estimates the marginal effects of response probabilities of
working in the agricultural sector (P(ocup = 0)), of working in the non-agricultural sector (P(ocup
= 1)), of working independently P(ocup = 2)) and of working in other employments (P(ocup = 3)).
The estimated results shall allow us to verify in which form explanatory variables affect personal
occupational decisions in the labor market.
      Additionally, these response probabilities shall be used to set factors or variables that correct
the selection bias problem in the estimation of the income equation (5) as demonstrated in the
previous section. In this second stage, the estimation of the income equation shall allow to verify
the hypothesis of NPT existence.

      With these patterns, we estimated four income regressions using equation (5) in which
dependent variables are the income of the agricultural, non-agricultural, independent and other
employment sectors. The agricultural sector is composed of producers working in agricultural
exploitation, farmers, mixed production entrepreneurs, tenants, marsh dwellers, rural workers,
foremen, farmers, temporary rural employees and trainees.
      The non-agricultural sector is composed of the extractive industry workers, civil construction
and the textile, electronics and mechanics, iron and steel, food and drinks, tobacco, timber and real
estate sectors; the military, the police, the fire brigade, public powers and corporate managers,
technicians, salesmen, services providers, professors and public services employees.
      The independent sector includes people who exploit their own undertakings, alone or with
partners and without any employees, regardless of having or not a non-remunerated aid from a
member of the family unit in their residence. It also includes the following industry sectors: trades,
automotive, domestic services and repairs, oil retail traders, construction and other services. The
“other employments” sector refers to the following categories: employers (a person who works
exploiting his own business having at least one employee regardless of having or not the aid of a
 non-remunerated worker from the family unit where he resides) and workers producing for their
 own consumption.
       Besides the factors that correct the selection bias, the other explanatory variables used in the
 equation estimation (5) are described in Chart 2.
       The choice of micronutrients was made based on their relevance in the Brazilian diet
 according to ANVISA (National Sanitary Control Agency). Average food prices were selected
 based on their importance in the Brazilian family budget: cereals and beans are the main items
 consumed, edible oil and sugar are intermediary goods and milk is a relatively luxury item for the
 poor.

       The explanatory variables for family profiles are commonly used in literature, such as the case
 of the household head age, average years of schooling, household head gender, the number of male
 and female adults, etc. Another explanatory variable used was the average rainfall, which is directly
 related to rural activities, as it can provoke from higher productivity to partial or total losses in a
 given harvest, thus affecting the search for employment in the sector. The control variable
 “localization of state in coastal areas or not” reflects the effects of the level of growth or economic
 stagnation. According to the specialized literature, this variable also affects the search for
 employment (JHA, GAIHA AND SHARMA, 2009).
       It is important to highlight that the Family Budget Research – FBR, allows to indirectly
 evaluate food consumption tendencies though estimates of expenses made with the purchase of
 foods for household consumption and their market prices. However, this research has some
 limitations, once it does not permit to access information on individual consumption patterns.
       Therefore, in order to establish the participation of each micronutrient in the total of foods
 consumed for each family and the total calorie intake per capita, we use a Food Nutrition Table
 provided by the IBGE. Studies on food consumption standards in Brazil are still scarce. The FBRs
of 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 are the only nationwide ones that include urban areas (Brazilian states
and greater regions) and rural areas (Brazil and greater regions) available in the country.

      Results suggest that the higher the age, the greater the probability of working in the non-
agricultural and independent sectors. Provided we acknowledge that age represents years of
experience, negative and significant square age values for the agricultural and non-agricultural
sectors characterize a concave relation between experience and the increase in the probability of
working in these sectors. In other words, more experience means higher chances of working in
these sectors until a certain limit, from which opportunities tend to start diminishing. In the
agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, the number of female adults in the family contributes to
decrease the chances of being employed in 3.6% in the first sector and 4.5% in the second one. The
number of male adults in the family does not affect employment chances in either sector.
      The family size collaborates to decrease employment chances in the non-agricultural sector in
1.99%, however increasing in 1.6% and 0.63% in the independent and other employment sectors
respectively. The male family head suffers a decrease of 17.3% and 13.5% in their employment
opportunities in the non-agricultural and other employments sectors respectively when compared to
females, however increasing in 19.01% and 11.71% their chances of being employed in the
agricultural and independent sectors.
      The average rainfall suggests a higher probability of working in agriculture and a lower
chance for the non-agricultural sector. Finally, individuals who live in states located on the coast,
have a higher chance of being employed in the independent and other employment sectors and a
lower chance of working in the agricultural sector. Such variables have implications in the search
for employment, as in general, coastal states have a better infrastructure and easier access to the
labor market.

6.1.2 Nutrition-Based Poverty Trap Estimation Results (NPT).

      The results estimated in the model (5) to verify the hypothesis of NPT existence for the four
sectors are entered in Tables A1 and A5. A positive and statistically significant sign of the
estimated coefficient for a particular nutrient per capita variable and a negative and significant sign
of the coefficient for that same square variable suggest the existence of NPT for that specific
nutrient. For the estimated coefficient significant effects, we consider significance levels of 5% and
10%. In rural Brazil, according to Table A1, we observe the phenomenon of nutrition-based poverty
trap for the case of calories in the agricultural, independent and other employment categories.
According to data provided in Tables A2 and A3, we perceive that the nutrition-based poverty trap
phenomenon is present for vitamins B1 and B2 in the agricultural, independent and other
employment sectors, as the coefficients for these variables were positive and statistically significant.
In table A4 we verify that workers in the non-agricultural, independent and other employments
sectors are subject to the poverty trap with regards to vitamin A. As for nutrient iron, we can see
that Table 5 shows that the agricultural, independent and other employments sectors are also subject
to the poverty trap.
       With regards to the other determinants, the estimated coefficient for the variable of average
years of schooling was positive and significant in all regressions. This is a standard result observed
in most empirical studies that correlate income and education. The coefficients for the price of sugar
and oil obtained a negative and significant result for the regressions of vitamin B2 and iron
(agricultural sector in Tables A3 and A5). As for the calorie regressions (agricultural sector in Table
A1) the oil coefficient presented the same result. Nutritional deficiencies vary with food prices, as
lower prices improve nutrition. For the other regressions, the price variable expressed a result that
contradicted expectations.
       The family profile variables, such as the number of male adults, showed a positive and
significant result for the regressions of calories, vitamin B1, B2 and A and iron for the agricultural,
independent and other employment categories, as shown in Tables A, A2, A3, A4 and A5
respectively. Results entered in Tables A1, A5, A2 and A4 suggest that the female adult variable
boasted positive and significant results for the regressions of calories, iron and vitamins B1 and A
for the independent sector and for vitamin B2 in the agricultural sector (Table A3). This means that
a higher number of adults in the family working in these sectors will result in higher income for
household heads. The family head age exerted a negative effect on income for the agricultural
sector and this square variable had a positive impact on vitamin B2 regressions (agricultural sector,
Table A3). This seems to suggest that workers in their initial stage of their labor lives earn less than
after they reach a certain age and achieve some work experience.
       The estimated coefficient for the coastal area variable was positive and significant in the
regressions for calories, vitamins B1, B2 and A for the other employments category, as
demonstrated by results shown on Tables A1, A2, A3 and A4. However, results from tables A3 and
A5 show that the variable localization presented a negative and significant coefficient for the
Vitamin B2 and iron regressions in the agricultural sector. This proves that agricultural workers
located in coastal states tend to earn lower wages than workers in the other employments sector,
possibly due to the fact that coastal states are more dynamic in economic terms. The average
rainfall variable did not show any statistical significance for the agricultural sector in any of the
analyzed regressions. In most of the studied regressions, some of the estimated coefficients for the
variables m0, m1, m2 and m3 were statistically significant, thus showing that the selections bias
correction was really necessary.

       According to the results entered in this table, in the agricultural sector, as an individual gets
older, employment chances diminish. In this sector, age reduces employment opportunities in
1.05%. This shows that the older the age, the lower the chance to work in the farming sector,
perhaps because agricultural activities demand more physical effort. This same result is not verified
in other sectors. Still, in this area, the number of male adults in the family contributes to the chance
of being employed in 6.75%. On the other hand, the number of female adults in the family
contributes to reducing employment opportunities in 4.92% and 7.96% for the independent sector.
This shows that female labor is associated to activities that demand less physical effort. On the
other hand, in the non-agricultural sector the possibility for women to be employed growths in
12.55%.
       The family size variable negatively affects employment chances in the non-agricultural sector
in 3.49%, however increasing 3.13% in the independent sector. If compared to the female
household head, the male head suffers a reduction of 11.06% in his chances to be employed in the
non-farming sector and an increase of 6.99% in the farming sector. The average rainfall suggests a
higher chance of working in agriculture and a lower chance of working in the non-agricultural and
other employments categories. The coastal variable demonstrates that individuals located in coastal
states have a lower probability of being employed in the farming sector, once coastal states in Brazil
have a more developed economic infrastructure.

6.2.2 Nutrition-based Poverty Trap (NPT) Estimation Results

       According to the results obtained from Tables A6 to A10, only the non-agricultural sector is
subject to the poverty trap with regards to calories. In this same sector, the poverty trap is also
verified for the the iron micronutrient, according to results entered in Table A10. Analyzing results
from Table A7, we corroborate that the poverty trap is present in the non-agricultural and
independent sectors with regards to the vitamin B1 nutrient as well. In the farming sector, we
noticed the poverty trap phenomenon for the vitamin B2 and iron nutrients, as shown in Table A8
and A10 respectively. Table A9 shows that workers in other employments are subject to the poverty
trap related to a vitamin A deficiency. As for the other determinants, again, the average schooling
years was positively correlated to income in all regressions and the average rainfall did not present
any statistical significance in any of the studied sectors through all analyzed regressions. The price
of oil showed a negative and significant result for the regressions of calories, iron, and vitamins B1
and A (independent sector, Table A8). The number of female adults in the family presented a
positive and significant coefficient for the vitamin B2 regression in the agricultural sector, as
expressed by the results in Table A8. Some estimated coefficients of variables 0, m1, m2 and m3
were statistically significant in several regressions, thus suggesting the need to correct the selection
bias.

      For rural Brazil, in the 2002-2003 period, the existence of NPT was verified for calories, iron
and vitamins B1, B2 and A for workers in the independent and other employments categories.
Employees of the agricultural sector obtained the same result, except for vitamin A. Workers in the
non-agricultural sector are subject to the poverty trap only with regards to vitamin A. In the period
from 2008 to 2009, NPT was proved for workers in the agricultural sector but only for iron and
vitamin 2. Non-agricultural sector workers suffered the poverty trap for calories, vitamin B1 and
iron. Self-employed workers suffered NPT related to vitamin B and workers in other employments
did not suffer from NPT for calories or the other analyzed nutrients.

7 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

       The main goal of this study was to verify the existence of the nutrition-based poverty trap
(NPT) analyzing the effects of micronutrient intake (calories, iron and vitamins A, B1 and B2) on
income in rural Brazil, correcting the problem of endogeneity between these variables. Although
micronutrient deficiencies still persist as a public health problem in Brazil, it is worth highlighting
that there has been an NPT reduction in the studied period for most workers in the analyzed sectors,
except for non-agricultural employees. The improvement in food consumption patterns in the
Brazilian population is probably originated in the economic and social transformations that resulted
in a reduction of poverty and malnutrition. Such facts suggest that the increase in family income
among the poorest and the reduction of essential food prices would be effective ways to increase the
intake of key nutrients in the diet of Brazilian families. These results agree with economics
literature, which highlights that nutritional policies are essential for the reduction of extreme
poverty and the acceleration of economic growth, as specialized economy and nutrition studies
remark that healthy workers in better nutritional state are more productive at work.
       Besides these public policies, it is worth mentioning the National Policy for Nutrition and
Feeding, approved in 1999 by the Ministry of Health, which has as its main objective the promotion
of food and nutrition safety for the Brazilian population. The Ministry of Health, Nutrition and
Public Health Programs that seeks to reduce micronutrient deficiencies in the Brazilian population
include vitamin A supplements, as well as ferrous sulphate for risk groups (babies, children and
pregnant women); the fortification of foods such as wheat flower and corn with iron and folic acid
and the addition of salt iodide for human consumption, as regulated by the National Agency of
Sanitary Control (Anvisa) through the Fome Zero Project and the program to reduce iron deficiency
anemia in Brazil, signed together with the food industry.
       With regards to the explanatory variables that affect the occupational decision of agents in the
labor market, we can infer that the older the age, the higher the probability of working outside the
agricultural sector and in self-employment. This evidence confirms the traditional literature
argument that older people have more difficulty getting jobs. Education measured through years of
schooling strongly contributes to the increase in income in the four sectors analyzed: agricultural,
non-agricultural, independent and other employments.
       In this context, we remark the need for long-term national public policies that consider
nutritional aspects and involve multiple initiatives such as raising more awareness among the target
populations, the regularity of food intake research, employment and income policies focused on the
low-end income sector, reduction of food prices and support to the food farming industry and
nutritional education initiatives.
       We can therefore highlight the relevance of this study in the sense of offering a contribution
to the economics and nutrition literature by quantifying the micronutrient and calorie deficiency in
the progress of the nutrition-based poverty trap, and as a consequence, the impact of such
deprivation in labor productivity, which emphasizes the importance of nutritional policies aimed at
breaking this trap and reducing poverty in the rural areas of Brazil.
