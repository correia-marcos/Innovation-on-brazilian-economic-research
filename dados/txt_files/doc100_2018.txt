                                         ABSTRACT
This paper’s objective is to contribute to the debate on relations between China and Latin
America (LA). The question is whether the trade agreements between these regions are
complementary or if they strengthen the dependence of Latin America on the international
scene. For this purpose we aim to observe the impacts of China's growth in LA countries
through the Computable General Equilibrium model (CGE). The chinese growth has been
simulated through an expansion of China's capital stock, as has occurred over the past few
decades. The results point to a pattern of reprimarization of the export agenda and decline in
the industrial activity of the selected countries of the LA, mainly in the sectors of high
technological intensity. In addition, there is an increase in welfare in the LA, mainly due to
gains in the terms of trade (commodity boom).

                                           RESUMO
O presente trabalho pretende contribuir para o debate a respeito das relações entre China e
América Latina (AL), a questão que se coloca é se os acordos comerciais entre essas regiões
são mutualmente benéficos ou se reforçam a dependência da AL no cenário internacional.
Para isto objetiva-se observar os impactos do crescimento da China nos países da AL através
do modelo de equilíbrio geral computável. O crescimento chinês foi simulado através de uma
expansão do estoque de capital deste país, tal como ocorreu ao longo das últimas décadas. Os
resultados apontam para um padrão de reprimarização da pauta exportadora e queda na
atividade industrial dos países selecionados da AL, principalmente nos setores de alta
densidade tecnológica. Além disso, observa-se o aumento de bem-estar na AL principalmente
por ganhos nos termos de troca (boom das commodities).

    1. INTRODUCTION

China is one of the main trading partners of Latin America (LA). Trade relations between
these regions are “strategic”, since LA has abundant natural resources that are essential to
Chinese industries such as soybeans, iron ore and oil. In contrast, LA represents a large
consumer market for Chinese products, which are characterized by manufactured goods.

Beside trade flows, China has been intensifying its diplomatic and political relations with
governments of Latin American countries. "Win-win" expressions are used by Chinese
representatives to highlight the mutual benefits in relations between China and LA.

In 2008 China launched the so-called first White Paper on Latin America and the Caribbean,
and in 2016 the second one. Both documents highlight where there could be considerable
cooperation among these regions, such as greater political proximity, intensification of
bilateral trade, investment in productive infrastructure, financial support, social support and
exchanges, cultural, international cooperation, peace and security agreements (China, 2016).

Chinese investments in the LA are based on participation in public services concessions
(energy, telecommunications and transportation) and direct investments based on financing
projects to consolidate road, rail and mineral resources (Silveira, 2017).

However, the question is whether the trade and investment agreements of these regions are
mutually beneficial or if strengthen the dependence of Latin America on the international
scene, considering that LA is a region characterized by exporting primary goods and
technologically dependent from the foreign market since the beginnings of its colonization
(Bázquez-Lidoy, Rodríguez and Santiso, 2006, Jenkins, Peters and Moreira, 2008, Ferchen,
2011, Cintra, 2013, Kim and Lee, 2014 and Silveira, 2017).

To contribute to this debate, this paper seeks to analyze the interdependence structure of trade
relations between selected LA countries- Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela- and China
through a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach using the Global Trade Analysis
Project (GTAP), version 9.0, with 2011 how reference year.

The empirical strategy is to simulate the effect of the growth of the Chinese economy by
expanding its capital stock by 10%, which corresponds to the average annual growth of its
capital stock in recent decades, according to Penn World Table 9.0. The aim is to evaluate the
impact of the growth of the Chinese economy in the sectorial production, exports and imports
and on welfare variation in the selected countries of the LA and in China itself.

In addition to this introduction, this paper presents a brief review of the relationship between
LA and China in the second section, the third section presents a description of the database
and the GTAP model, the fourth brings the results of the model, and finally, the fifth section
brings the final considerations.


   2. CHINESE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ITS IMPACT IN LATIN AMERICA

China has undergone considerable changes in its economic and social structure, especially
since the 1990s. Chinese industrial development is the result of planning, the famous phrase
of the ruler Deng Xiaoping in 1978 "it does not matter whether the cat is white or black,
provided he takes the mouse”, illustrates the Chinese economy, which, in a parallel among a
centralized economy and a market economy, is now the world's second largest economy in
terms of production (Cintra, 2013).
                                                                                                         3


From the structural point of view, a number of factors responsible for Chinese success are
highlighted, such as the establishment of Special Economic Zones, which consisted in the
creation of strategically concentrated clusters near Hong Kong to attract foreign investments
as well as positive spillovers, gradual opening of China's trade, intellectual appropriation of
production techniques, government investment in science and technology, and other
incentives (Nonnenberg, 2010).

The increase in China's productive capacity was based on an "extensive factor of production"
model, ie the widespread use of cheap labor and growth in investment. China grew mainly
through high capital plant investment, gross fixed capital formation increased from 29% to
42% of GDP over the period 1980 to 2010 (Beim, 2011).

In this context of expansion, China has enlarged its trade and financial relations with several
countries, including the Latin American ones. Trade relations between LA and China began to
grow in 2002, with China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) and intensified in
2004 with Hu Jintao's visit to LA in which trade and investment agreements were signed
(Medeiros and Cintra, 2015).

In the period between 2000 to 2016, it is possible to observe heterogeneities in the share of
exports from the selected countries from LA to China. There are Latin American countries
that do not have a definite trajectory of growth of their exports, like Colombia, Panama,
Paraguay and Venezuela. Chile, Peru, and Brazil stand out for their significant increase in this
post-crisis participation of 2008 (Figure 1).

Figure 2 shows that the selected LA countries show a growth trend of imports from China over
the period 2000-2016. With the exception of Costa Rica, most countries presented in 2016
more than 16% of their imports from China. It is noted that China has a larger share of the
total imported by the selected countries of the LA compared to yours exports.

China, on the other hand, is less "dependent" of LA in terms of trade flows, as shown in
Figures 3 and 4.

Participations of selected LA countries in the volume exported and imported by China vary
between 0% and 4.5%. Regarding the destination of Chinese exports, Brazil, Mexico,
Panama, Chile and Argentina stand out. As for the origin of Chinese imports, Brazil and Chile
stand out.

There is a reduction in the share of Chinese exports to selected LA countries from 2010,
which can be explained by the augment in total exports from China to other countries and not
by the loss of importance of Chinese sales to LA once they grew significantly in the post-
crisis period of 2008.

Costa Rica stands out for drop sales to China in 2015-2016. This may be linked to Intel's exit
from Costa Rica in 2014.

In addition to the differences in the amount of exports and imports, there are qualitative
differences in the commercial pattern of the LA and China, which reflects a primary export
structure of LA, to the detriment of the industrial standard and greater technological content
from China, as shown in Figures 5 and 6.

It is noteworthy that Latin American countries, with the exception of Costa Rica and Mexico,
exhibit a pattern of exports of primary products and of medium/low technology industrial
products to China. The primary products correspond to the greater part of the export portion
of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. Mexico and the rest of the
World have a more diversified export agenda with China, presenting parcels of the most
distributed exports among the sectors of their economy. Costa Rica is the only country that
has most of its exports to China from the high-tech industrial sector in 2011.

With regard to imports from China, their technological pattern is opposite to exports to China,
focusing mainly on industrial segments: high, medium and low technology products. Primary
products and services correspond to less than 10% of the imports in the selected countries.

In general, there is a greater commercial dependence of the LA with China than the opposite,
as well as an antagonism in the commercial pattern between these regions, which reflects in a
primary export structure of the LA in detriment of the pattern of industrial trade and of the
greater technologic content of imports from China.

The antagonism in trade relations between LA and China can be explained by the different
trajectories of economic growth and external insertion adopted by these two economies,
especially since the 1990s (Barbosa, 2011). While China concentrated investments to
restructure its productive structure in industrial follow-ups, LA's industrial policies cooled
down in this period.

However trade relations between LA and China are controversial. Blázquez-Lidoy, Rodríguez
and Santiso (2006) evaluate whether China can be seen as an "angel" or "demon" for
emerging economies. In the short term, these authors state that China would have a positive
influence on Latin America, especially in commodity-exporting countries, due to the "demand
shock", with improved terms of trade and higher exported volumes (commodity boom). The
negative short-term effect would be mainly in countries with a competing export and
production pattern of Chinese products, such as Mexico, Costa Rica and Brazil. In the long
run, though, the authors state that there is an incentive to the reprimarization the production
and export agenda the AL, which would lead these economies to become more vulnerable to
shocks (recessions and booms) in commodity prices.

Jenkins, Peters and Moreira (2008) also analysed the perspective that trades between LA and
China brings winners and losers. In addition, the authors question the thesis that producers
and exporters of raw materials, such as South American countries - Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Venezuela - were the "winners" and that Mexico and the Central American countries,
specialized in chains of merchandise, were the losers. The authors drew attention to the fact
that the bilateral trade nature of LA and China reproduce the core-periphery pattern of the
exchange of manufactures for raw materials, in addition to not taking into account the
ecological, economic and social sustainability of these relations in the long run.

    3. DATABASE AND METHODOLOGY

3.1 Database

The database is provided by the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), a project coordinated
by the Department of Agricultural Economics at Pardue University in the Center of Global
Trade Analysis. The GTAP has a standard multi-region and multi-sector model of CGE
analysis, with 140 regions and 57 commodities. RunGTAP software and version 9 of the
GTAP static model, which has 2011 as the reference year, are used.

The 140 regions that make up the GTAP base were aggregated in 16 regions: Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay,
Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, rest of Latin America5 and rest of the World6.
5
 Rest of South America, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, rest of Central America and Dominican
Republic.
                                                                                                              8



The primary factors of production are divided into three categories: land, capital, and labor.
Labor and capital are movable factors of production, whose mobility is given by an elasticity
of constant transformation. The land factor is immobile and is present only in the primary
goods production sector.

The sector aggregation of the 57 sectors of the GTAP base is fundamented on the OECD
(2011) parameters that defines four categories of technological intensity for industrial
products: low, medium-low, medium-high and high technology. In addition, the services
sector and the primary goods production sector are analyzed separately. The products
corresponding to each sector are presented in Annex 1.

3.2 The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)

CGE models describe all economic activities such as consumption, production, employment,
taxes, domestic and foreign trade, and savings. These models involve two equations structures
given by countries' social accounting matrices and by the microfoundation economy, in order
to characterize and match these matrices among the different agents (Castilho, 1994).

The GTAP model is a multi-region and multisectorial CGE model. The assumptions of the
GTAP are perfect competition and constant returns to scale. Figure 7 shows the structure of
an economy modeled by GTAP.

At the top of the figure is the "regional household", responsible for capturing and distributing
all the expenses and income of the economy, coming from the payment of the firms by the use
of production factors (VOA) and the collection of taxes (TAX), and which forming the
regional income.

The regional income is distributed to private household (PRIVEXP), government (GOVEXP)
and global savings (SAVE), based on the Constant Function of Difference of Elasticity (CDE)
non-homothetic utilities functions, flexible to changes in prices and income (Liu et al., 1998).

Another agent is the sector of goods and services production (producer), that agent has its
revenues from the sale of its products to private household (VDPA), the government
(VDGA), other producers (VDFA) and the rest of the World (VXMD). Besides that, the
productive sector is financed by global savings (NETINV). Production sector expenses are

                        Source: own elaboration based on Brockmeier (2001).

Firms production functions are modeled by Leontief-type technology, with constant
substitution elasticity, both to for the intermediate goods demands (inputs from other
industries or from them) and for the ''production primary factors (land, capital and labor)
(Hertel et al., 2012). Moreover, by separability hypothesis, substitution between intermediate
goods and production factors is not allowed.

The bilateral trade for intermediate goods is outlined by the Armington assumption, which
guarantees that firms, by minimizing their costs, decide the optimal mix of domestic
intermediate goods (VDFA) and imported (VIFA) and only then decide on the origin of the
imports.

The external sector of the economy (rest of the World) also interacts with the private
household and the government through the purchase of imported goods and services - VIPA
and VIGA, respectively.

The model also deals with trade margins and the taxes or subsidies of domestic or foreign
production. Exports are valued at Free On Board (FOB) and imports at Cost Insurance Freigh
(CIF) which include insurance or freight costs, if any. Export (XTAX) and import (MTAX)
revenues are also directed to the regional household.
                                                                                                                 10


In addition, the GTAP presents a global banking sector, which mediates global savings and
trade, leaving no gaps between supply and demand for goods (Hertel and Tsigas, 1997).

The closure of the model, in other words, the choice of the endogenous and exogenous
variables is the GTAP standard, in which the capital stock is considered fixed. The model
allows variations of investment in the different regions, however, because it is a static model,
these investments are not fed back into the economy.

3.3 Empirical Strategy

The strategy is to simulate the growth of the Chinese economy through expanding
investments in capital (increase of the total capital stock). Chinese's capital stock growth rate,
at 2011constant prices, was 6% between 1955-1970, 7.5% between 1971-1980, 7.6% between
1981-1990, 9.5% between 1991-2000 and 11.72% from 2001 to 2014.

Chinese's capital stock growth rate between 1981 and 2014 is 9.6% and the empirical strategy
is to simulate a 10% (rounded) growth in the China's capital stock by verifying the impacts of
this growth in production sector, exports and imports, and in the welfare of selected LA
countries and in China itself.

decrease in production in LA countries is higher in the high-tech sector. The only positive
changes in industrial production are in the medium-high, medium-low and low-tech sectors of
Costa Rica and in the low-tech sector in Paraguay.

There is also an expansion in the production of the services sector in the countries under
analysis. Production of primary products also increased, with the exception of Colombia (-
0.11), Ecuador (-0.01) and Venezuela (-0.04), which varied negatively the production in this
sector.

In China the expansion in the capital stock led to an enlargement of production in all sectors,
especially in the industrial sectors linked to high and medium-high complexity technologies.

From Table 2, it's noticeable that LA’s exports varied negatively in the industrial and services
segments, given the shock of Chinese capital expansion. With the exception of Costa Rica,
that increased its exports in the industrial of medium-high, medium-low technology and in the
services sectors and Mexico, which positively varied its low-technology industrial exports and
services.

Mexico has diversified its productive structure over the years and Costa Rica is characterized
by the manufacture of computers chips and other electronics, especially after the country
started to export to Lenovo, HP and Dell, which maintains their assembly lines in China
(Medeiros and Cintra, 2015, Castillo and Neto, 2016). The rest of the World also increased
services exports given the increase in China's capital stock.

Primary good's sector's exports, with the exception of Colombia and Paraguay, also varied
positively, which refers to a process of reprimarization of the exporting parcel of AL.

In contrast to the LA countries, China has expanded its exports in the industrial sectors,
particularly in the high and medium technology sectors. Along with that, Chinese exports of
primary goods declined.

Table 3 shows the variation in imports. LA in general showed an increase in imports in the
industrial segments, especially in the high technology sector. Costa Rica and Mexico showed
a fall in imports from the industrial sectors. A decrease in Latin American primary goods
imports can be observe, with the exception of Brazil, Peru and Mexico that augmented
importation in this segment.

China, on the other hand, experienced a decline in imports from the high and medium-high
technology sectors and an expansion in imports from technological lower-intensity industrial
sectors, services and primary products, with emphasis to the increase in imports from the
primary sector (7.15).

The welfare variation is calculated from the equivalent variation, representing the change in
wealth that would be equivalent to the change in prices, in terms of its impact on well-being
(Mas-Collel, 1995). The welfare decomposition effect portrays the shock's impacts on
economic contributions, measured in monetary units.

According to Burfisher (2011) the welfare decomposition effect can be divided into six
components: a) allocative efficiency effect: showing the excess of each tax, b) endowment
effect: due to changes in the quantities of production factor's (eg, the capital) that change the
productive capacity of an economy, c) technology effect: due to changes in the productivity of
factors and/or intermediate products which change the effective endowments of an economy
and its productive capacity, (d) effect on trade in goods produced (terms of trade): due to
changes in the rest of the world and in the economy in relation to prices of exported goods
and services (fob) and imported goods and services (cif), e) savings-investment effect: due to
a change in the price of capital goods in relation to the saving price in the global bank, f)

effects change in preferences: due to changes in private consumption, government actions and
savings in national spending.

With the positive shock of 10% in the Chinese capital stock, it is noticeable that the net
welfare variation was positive for all countries, except for Costa Rica. Countries' welfare
variations are due to the allocation effect, endowment effect, terms of trade effect and
investment-savings, as shown in Table 4.

It’s visible that only China has had an effect on factor endowments thanks to the increase in
its capital stock. The welfare decomposition effects point to a positive allocation effect in the
analyzed regions, with the exception of Peru and Costa Rica.

The effect on terms of trade measures the purchasing power of an economy and is calculated
using a proportion between exported goods price's and imported goods prince's. Thus, given
that China's increased industrial goods' production and an raised in its demand for primary
products (commodity boom), LA countries benefited from trade due to improved terms of
trade. The change in the terms of trade was negative for China and Costa Rica which could
have was a "competitive" outcome with the Chinese production.

The effect of investment-savings relationship is different between countries and depends on
whether the country is a demander or a net supplier of savings.

Overall, the biggest gains in welfare are in China, which received a 10% shock on its capital
stock. It is also worth mentioning the welfare rise in Brazil, which has China as its main
trading partner (Brazil, 2017).

   5. CONCLUSIONS

This paper proposes to empirically observe, through the CGE model, the impacts of China's
growth in the selected LA countries and on China itself. Chinese growth was simulated by
expanding its occurred country's capital stock by 10% such as it has over the past few
decades.

Latin American countries are export mostly of primary products to China, as well as products
of low technological intensities. In contrast, Chinese exports to LA consist of products linked
to industrial segment, such as high- and medium-technology sectors, in addition to Chinese
manufactures of low technological intensity and low cost. The impacts of the Chinese growth
simulation show a declivity in the selected LA countries' industrial production and an
expansion in the production of primary products and in the service sector of that region.

However, there are exceptions, such as Costa Rica, that escalated in production and
exportation of industrial sectors, except in the high technology sector, as well as had a
reduction in industrial imports. It’s important to accentuate that Intel's exit from Costa Rica in
2014 may have had an impact on the country's commercial relationships.

Mexico is also a particular case of the Latin American general rule, with a decline in medium
and low technology industrial imports. The Mexican economy has been experiencing an
improvement in its exports in recent years. At the same time that it is undergoing for
competition and commercialization with China, Mexico has more intense trade relations with
the United States.

Still, the general scenario in LA is worrisome, since in one hand the partnership between
China and LA increased the general well-being of these economies throughout the years 2000,
with the commodities boom the reality is an indication of deindustrialization in Latin
American countries with a decrease in the industrial production share and an increase in the
production in the services and primary goods sectors.

On the other hand, China has been increased its industrial production and technological
intensity, and is no longer just an exporting economy of cheap manufacturing products, but
competing in the high technology segments, including being able to preclude the advance of
Latin American production in these segments.

So the question is: multual benefits or dependence on trade relations between China and LA?
LA is a cradle of natural resources, however, the dependence that these countries face in
relation to the production of these resources, makes them vulnerable in the international
scenario, that is, susceptible to booms and falls in commodity prices. Chinese economic
growth and the consequent increase in the demand for commodities by this country stands as
a demonstrative of the degree of specialization in the productive and export LA agenda and
its fragility to the competition in industrial segments.

If Latin American countries want to build a success story in pursuit of their economic
development, they need to rethink their trade relations with China, not forgetting to watch for
their internal deficiencies. Investing in quality human capital, infrastructure, seeking technical
advance with a planned industrial policy with all segments of society, including the market
and the State, are necessary conditions for LA to get out of the bonds of dependence on the
international stage.
