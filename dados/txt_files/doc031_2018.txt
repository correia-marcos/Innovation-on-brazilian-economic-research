                This paper assesses the role of financial conditions in the business cycles in emerging
          markets. Evidence from nonlinear VAR relating macroeconomic variables to proxies of
          financial conditions suggest that: (a) stressful times occur with considerable frequency,
          about 30% of time; (b) second moments of the main macroeconomic variables are regime
          dependent, with consumption and investment being more correlated with GDP and
          with larger volatility for all variables considered under financial distress conditions; (c)
          consumption is more volatile than GDP both under a regular financial condition and in
          a financial distress period; (d) the duration of the financial instability period is about 5
          quarters; (e) and there are strong amplification effects related to the tightening of the
          credit conditions.

1         Introduction
One of the most striking aspects of the business cycles in emerging markets (EMs) is the pattern
of the second moments of the macroeconomic data, particularly when compared to those of
advanced economies (AEs): emerging economies experience much more substantial and frequent
swings. Two empirical regularities can illustrate the differences between these groups: (i) GDP
is twice as volatile in the EM group as in the AE group; (ii) consumption has a higher standard
deviation than that of output in EMs, while the converse occurs in rich countries. (see, for
example, Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007; Uribe and Schmitt-Grohé, 2017).
     A large body of literature has been paying attention to the role of many distinct factors that
could potentially account for these differences, e.g., less developed institutional environments,
weaker economic policies, and greater dependence on (a few) commodities in EMs. However,
almost all known episodes in the recent years of sharp movements in the international financial
markets coincide with massive changes in the volatilities in such economies. Not surprisingly,
recent researches have found a significant role played by the financial frictions in the business
cycles in EMs. (see Akinci, 2017; Chang and Fernández, 2013; Garcı́a-Cicco et al., 2010).
Because the responses of these economies to financial instability seems more pronounced than in

AEs—at least on average—, the state of the financial conditions naturally emerges as a potential
explanation for the observed differences between EMs business cycles and AEs.1
     Accordingly, in this paper, I assess the consequences of “bad” financial conditions to the
dynamic behavior of macroeconomic variables in EMs. To do so, I employ an econometric
strategy that treats the financial conditions as an endogenous state variable, allowing to access
the macroeconomic implications of distinct financial states. I fed a Bayesian Panel Threshold-
VAR Model (BPT-VAR) with an estimated Financial Stress Index (FSI) for 25 EM economies
and used it to analyze the implications of financial instability to the economy. Within the BPT-
VAR, I define the regimes as two different states of nature indicated by the FSI: tranquil—or
normal—times are situations in which the financial markets are relatively stable (low FSI),
while stressful times—or financial distress—are periods of high financial instability (high FSI).2
The BPT-VAR, with the embedded estimated financial instability indicators, endogenously
estimates the threshold values at which each economy in the sample switches from one regime
to another. These thresholds allow to separate the data into the two different regimes and to
calculate regime-dependent impulse response functions and regime-dependent moments.
     The results that emerge from the empirical analysis show that financial conditions are
essential to understanding the business cycles in EMs, inducing strong non-linear effects. The
findings can be synthesized through the following empirical regularities:
  (i) emerging markets are prone to frequent regime switching in their financial conditions:
      stressful periods occur with a considerable frequency in the data (∼ 30% of the time);3
 (ii) second moments of the main macroeconomic variables are regime dependent: first, con-
      sumption and investment correlations with GDP tend to be higher in financial distress
      periods. Second, volatility is much larger for the GDP, consumption, and investment
      in financial instability contexts. These patterns suggest that decisions become more
      dependent on the current income instead of the intertemporal—or permanent—income.
      Thus, financial frictions seems to be associated with raising credit constraints;
 (iii) in both regimes, consumption is more volatile than the GDP;
 (iv) the mean duration of financial distress periods is 5 quarters;
 (v) conforming with the facts (ii), impulse responses are strongly regime dependent for most
     of the countries. Under financial instability conditions, consumption and investment
     responses tend to be strongly amplified. These findings are consistent with the notion of
     the amplification effect of financial frictions.
     A critical problem when analyzing the empirical implications of financial instability to EMs
business cycles is the limited data availability. I try to circumvent this problem by efficiently
extracting information from the data: first, I construct a measure of financial conditions for
each country using the method advocated in Koop and Korobilis (2014), which is more flexible
then principal component methods as it is robust to gaps and unbalanced series. Second, I
estimate the BPT-VAR through Bayesian Panel VAR methods (see, for example, Canova and
Ciccarelli, 2013) assuming an hierarchical structure within each regime introducing a regime-

       For a comparison, the so-called sudden stops are said to be rare events, occurring in less than 4% of time (see
Calvo et al., 2006; Mendoza, 2010). The methodology employed here treats such events as extreme realizations
of financial distresses.

specific exchangeable prior similar to Jarociński (2010).4 Such a prior is convenient here since
it express the beliefs that EMs share many features in terms of dynamics within regimes, and
the Bayesian pooling exploits information from all countries to efficiently make the individual
estimations, improving the accuracy when just a few observations are available for some country
in a specific regime.5
     A large body of literature has focused on business cycles in emerging markets, mainly
motivated by the observed excess volatility of output and consumption in these economies. Many
studies on this topic have used structural models in the spirit of Mendoza (1991), augmented
with trend shocks in the spirit of Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) or with financial frictions, as
in Neumeyer and Perri (2005), Garcı́a-Cicco et al. (2010), Chang and Fernández (2013), and
Mendoza (2010). This paper is particularly related to the latter branch of literature, aiming
to assess the role of financial friction in those economies. However, in this paper, I focuses
on characterizing business cycles from a reduced-form analysis perspective coupled with a
detrending technique, which is an avenue taken by Agenor et al. (2000), Lane (2003), and
Calderón and Fuentes (2010). Moreover, I use a unified framework for many countries that
allows us to compare the impulse responses to shocks in GDP and in the financial conditions
using a Bayesian Hierarchical Panel VAR structure similar to Ciccarelli and Rebucci (2006),
Canova and Pappa (2007), Jarociński (2010), Canova and Dallari (2013), and Forero (2015).
The only difference is that here the model features a nonlinear regime-switching structure.
      The paper does not try to offer any explanation for the causes of financial instability in
EMs. However, it is arguably important to understand the empirical implications of financial
frictions for macro-variables as well as the degree of exposure of such economies to international
financial shocks, which are my main focus.
     The remainder of the paper is presented in three sections. Section 2 describes the method-
ology. Section 3 reports the results, and section 4 presents the conclusions.


2        Accessing Nonlinearities in the Emerging Markets
        Business Cycles
This section outlines the methods employed to estimate the threshold transition parameters
for each country in the sample and describes how I extract the financial stress index from the
data. I begin by describing the HTB-VAR model that implicitly links the exogenous estimated
financial stress index to the economic activity. Then I present the procedure and the criteria to
select a variable to be part of the financial condition indicator.


2.1     A Two-Regimes Bayesian Panel Threshold-VAR

I modeled each emerging economy as an individual threshold vector autoregressive (T-VAR)
model. Although flexible, T-VAR models can suffer from high dimensionality, which is even
more problematic for emerging markets because of the limited length of the time series. I

     As shown in Hsiao et al. (1999) and further in Gilhooly et al. (2012), linear VARs with such a prior can
have very good small sample performance, even with only a few time series observations for each cross-sectional
unit. As T-VARs are linear conditioned to a regime, the small sample properties of linear VARs with hierarchical
prior schemes naturally extend to our contexts. Moreover, the BPT-VAR can be used within unbalanced panels,
and thus is able to extract all information available.

do so, I combine the individual information with the cross-sectional information in each regime
introducing a hierarchical structure setup. Importantly, the particular hierarchical structure, as
represented by exchangeable priors, reflects the prior belief that countries tend to perform in a
similar fashion within a certain regime, although there might be differences between regimes.

2.1.1      The Minnesota-Style Prior and Cross-Sectional Shrinkage

For the variances Λrc I follow Jarociński (2010) in specifying a Minnesota-like prior given by
λr Lc , where:
                                                 σ 2cn
                                            Lc = 2
                                                  σ ck
The only difference from Jarociński’s scheme is that I assume λ to be regime-specific. The prior
for this parameter is given by:
                                                                 
                                                   − v+2       1s
                             p(λ|s, v) = IG2 ∝ λ      2  exp −                                (5)

Under such a prior, Jarociński (2010) shows that the posterior for λ is given by:

2.1.2      Non-Linear Impulse Responses

To analyze the dynamic responses of the variables in this nonlinear context, we must take into
account both history and the possibility of a regime switch. These requirements are at odds
with traditional impulse response functions present in linear VARs since, by construction, they
are symmetrical and history-independent of the current state of the business cycles. To better
capture the nonlinear nature of the TVARs, I make use of the generalized impulse response
(GIRF) proposed by Koop et al. (1996), defined as:

                         GIRFy (h, εt , Ht−1 ) = E[Yt+h |εt , Ht−1 ] − E[Yt+h |Ht−1 ]                      (6)

where h is the length of the simulation horizon and Ht−1 is the history in period t.6
      A concise outline of how to estimate the GIRF in a Bayesian VAR context is as follows:
given a period-t shock, εt , and the history of what happened within the system until t − 1, Ht−1 ,
take the i-th draw from the Gibbs sampler of the parameters of the model, e.g. Θ(i) . For each
draw, compute GIRFy (h, εt , Ht−1 |Θ(i) ) for a hundred of possible paths. Then, all we have to do
is to integrate over Θ(i) . To do so, we estimate GIRFy simply by computing

                                                       D
                            ˆ y (h, εt , Ht−1 ) = 1
                                                    X
                          GIRF                          GIRFy (h, εt , Ht−1 |Θ(i) )
                                                  D i=1
where D is the number of draws. As stressed by Galvão and Owyang (2014), the GIRF in a
nonlinear context measures the effects of a one-standard-deviation shock to a selected variable
on the endogenous variables, assuming a specific set of histories at the impact. In practice, note
that we can calculate GIRFy (h, εt , Ht−1 ) for specific events in Ht−1 , which means that we can
condition the estimates for each regime, thus obtaining regime dependent impulse responses.
Moreover, the GIRFs are defined so that the regime can chance over horizon.


   6
       From now on, I use term impulse response meaning generalized impulse response functions.


                                                      5
     The algorithm to compute (1) under the assumed priors is presented in the appendix C.
As the GIRFs are computed for a given draw of the parameters vector, the confidence band can
be based on the uncertainty from parameters if we are interested in the idiosyncratic estimation.
However, as I focus on the average (panel) response, I compute confidence band based on the
median impulse response for each country. In the next section, I discuss the method used to
estimate the financial conditions for each emerging market to feed the BPT-VAR model.


2.2    The Financial Stress Index

A financial stress index (FSI) is intended to be a broad measure reflecting the current state of
the financial markets. Such an index is constructed as a continuous variable where financial
crises are at one extreme, and normal financial conditions are at the other. Usually, a FSI is
based on a combination of many financial stress indicators for specific markets, with each of
them constructed from many different observable variables, which enables the index to represent
the whole financial system with one single measure.
     Methods for extracting from data the information that can synthesize the state of financial
markets are now well-established. They are usually based on principal component methods,
as in Hatzius et al. (2010), sub-index weighting schemes similar to Cardarelli et al. (2009),
or the Kalman Filter coupled with advanced weighting schemes, as in Koop and Korobilis
(2014). No matter what kind of method is used, the construction of a FSI faces identification
problems. Moreover, one may face difficulties in choosing which sub-index should be included in
the broader index, as well as in deciding what variable can best represent a particular sub-index.
      When constructing such a FSI for many countries, a common practice in the literature is
to limit the number of variables composing a sub-index—instead of using as many as possible—.
This is done for two main reasons: (i) data availability, which may be scarce when dealing with
emerging markets, and (ii) comparability.
     Concerning (i), one can take advantage of the existence of common factors driving the
financial markets, so that even a few variables may contain the most relevant information about
the common components. Thus, the marginal gain of information is a decreasing function of the
number of variables. When it comes to (ii), comparability is desired when one aims to analyze
the effects of global shocks and spillover effects on countries, as in Cardarelli et al. (2009) for
advanced economies and as in Balakrishnan et al. (2011) for emerging markets. In the present
case, we need a comparable proxy so that the central distribution of the common coefficients is
unaffected by the index.
      My measure of financial stress in emerging markets closely follows that proposed by
Balakrishnan et al. (2011) for emerging economies. The authors argue that an emerging market
is likely to be influenced by financial stresses coming from international markets —in particular,
from advanced economies and other emerging economies. Changes in factors such as global
GDP growth and prices such as interest rates can have a substantial impact on the financial
conditions within an emerging market. On the other hand, a country-specific factor expressed
by the degree of financial and trade linkages and macroeconomic vulnerabilities can make a
country more exposed to a financial stress period.
     However, while I follow Balakrishnan et al. (2011) in constructing and selecting the variables
to be included in our measure of financial conditions, I extract the information from the data
employing the method proposed by Koop and Korobilis (2014). Such a method have many
advantages compared to the pure principal component methods widely used in the literature.
First, it account for an unbalanced set of financial variables, a recurrent problem when it comes

                                                6
to emerging economies—in which data is frequently scarce prior to 2000. Second, the method
takes into account that an ideal financial stress index should only express shocks on the financial
system, as emphasized by Hatzius et al. (2010). This can be done by estimating a system of
equations containing not only financial variables but also macroeconomic variables expressing
the macroeconomic environment so that the macroeconomic information is purged from the
estimated index. Third, the weights are calculated from the data, so that the researchers can
stay agnostic from each of the financial variables that should be included at a specific moment
of time.7 The appendix is devoted to presenting the method used in more detail.
     I construct a Financial Stress Index for all countries for which I have sufficient data.
Following the suggestions by Balakrishnan (2011), our measure includes the following sub-
indexes:


Banking Sector Stress - FCI.1
  (i) Banking Sector-β - This measure, given by the ratio of bank share prices to total share
      prices, aims to isolate the stress of the banking sector in terms of the whole economy. It is
      our first choice sub-index to measure banking sector stress and is given by:
                                                               m      b
                                                          cov(rc,t , rc,t )
                                                 βc,t =                     ,
                                                            var(m)

       where rb and rm are the returns to the banking sector stock index and the overall stock
       index. A value β > 1 means that the banks are relatively riskier compared the average
       volatility of the other markets. I estimate β using monthly data from DataStream based
       on a twelve-months rolling window, assigning a value of 1 when β > 1 and 0 otherwise.
       The overall return is proxied by the return of the S&P500.
 (ii) Bank Spreads For countries with unavailable data to compute βc,t , I measure the stress
      in the banking sector using the spread in the loan versus deposit rates using data from
      the IFS.


Foreign Market Pressure - FCI.2 To capture instabilities in the exchange markets, I use
the exchange market pressure Index (EMPI) proposed by Eichengreen et al. (2004), which is
defined as                                      !                 !
                                  ∆ec,t − µc,∆e     ∆Rc,t − µc,∆R
                     EM P Ic,t =                  −
                                     σc,∆e             σi,∆R
where ∆ is the monthly variation, µ is the mean value, σ is the standard deviation, e is the
nominal exchange rate of local currency per dollar, and R stands for the reserves.


Equity Market Volatility - FCI.3 and - FCI.4 For the Equity Market, I use two sub-
indexes.
  (i) FCI.3 Following Balakrishnan et al. (2011), I proxied the stress surrounding the security
      markets by the negative of the annual variation of the overall index in country c, given by

   7
      Moreover, although the computations are much more complex compared to a pure principal component
method, the method proposed by the authors is quite fast under certain setups. Combined with the high
flexibility, computation cost is another reason why I choose not to include the financial stress measure as another
layer in our TVAR. For example, the methods proposed by Lopes and West (2004) could be employed as
additional equations in the Gibbs sampler, but the computational burden would be increased.


                                                          7
       ∆12 yc = yc,t − yc,t−12 , where yc is the overall index in country c in period t.

 (ii) FCI.4 The second sub-index attempts to capture the effects of expected loss, risk, or
      uncertainty about firms’ future profits. An increase is expected in this variable when the
      likelihood of a financial stress period increases. To construct this measure, I estimate
      simple GARCH(1,1) models for each of the emerging economies in our sample using the
      following process:
                                   2
                                 σc,t                            2
                                      = ω + φc,1 ε2c,t−1 + φc,2 σc,t−1 + c,t
       where σt2 is the variance of a regression of an AR(1) regression for the overall equity price
       index.



Sovereign Debt Stress - FCI.5

    (i) EMBI+ The EMBI+, as calculated by J.P.Morgan, is our preferred measure of stress
        related to sovereign debts.

 (ii) Sovereign Spread 1 For countries where EMBI+ is unavailable or to short, I use the
      spread between the interest rate on sovereign debt in country c and 3-month USA bonds.

(iii) Sovereign Spread 2 Alternatively, I use the spread between security markets in country
      c compared to the USA.

 (iv) Sovereign Spread 3 Finally, for countries with gaps in EMBI+, I fill the missing data
      using credit default swaps (CDS) data.




3      Estimations and Empirical Findings

The datasets used in this paper are presented in Tables 5 and 6 in the appendix. They encompass
financial as well macroeconomic data from a set of 25 emerging economies. The only criterion
for a country to be selected is data availability. For the FSI, I use monthly data to construct
the sub-indexes described in the previous section and take the quarterly average after ensuring
that the series are stationary and free of seasonality effects. For the GDP, consumption, and
investment, I use the logarithm of the real values and compute deviations from a trend (HP-Filter
and BN-Filter proposed by Grant and Chan (2017) and Kamber et al. (2018), respectively). As
the data come from many different sources and are of different time spans, I refer the reader to
the aforementioned tables to access detailed information.

      Lets start by presenting the results for the FSIs. As suggested by the visual inspection of
Figure 1, the frequency of financial stress periods in EMs seem quite high. Importantly, there are
clearly two distinct pictures. Prior to 2004, financial instability appeared to be governed by both
international and idiosyncratic forces. From 2004 onwards, the international markets’ condition
seems to be the most important determinant of financial stability. However, a comprehensive
study of the determinants of the FSI in EMs is out of the scope of this paper. For the interested
reader, I refer to Balakrishnan et al. (2011) and Park and Mercado (2014). Plots of the individual
series are available upon request.

    To analyze the implications of financial instability and how it dynamically affects an
emerging economy, I estimate the BPT-VAR embedded with the estimated FSIs. I setup each
VAR equation as follows:                              
                                                yc,t
                                               cc,t 
                                      y c,t = 
                                               ic,t 
                                                       

                                               f sic,t
where yc,t is GDP, cc,t is consumption, ic,t is investment and f sic,t is the financial stress index.
Because of the limited time span, I restricted the maximum lag to 3, with Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) favoring a BPT-VAR with one lag. Using the priors described in section 2.1,
settled under a fairly loose scheme, I ran the Bayesian algorithm to search for endogenous
regime-switching in the sample. The results are expressed in Figure 4 in the appendix and are
summarized in Table 1.

     From the BPT-VAR estimates, EMs are economies prone to frequent financial instabilities
that may have consequences for macroeconomic variables. In the sample, a typical emerging
economy switches from one regime to another about 30% of the time. Moreover, when a crisis
begins, it takes about one and a half years for the economy to return to a stable financial
condition.
     Turning to the analyses of the empirical implications of financial distress, I use the estimated
unobservable threshold parameters for each EM in the sample to separate each time series into
periods of financial instability and periods of tranquility. Then, using the separated time series,
I compute the regime-dependent moments —i.e., business cycle moments within regimes—and
compare them between regimes. The results are expressed in Table 2.
      Financial frictions have serious implications for EMs, affecting the business cycles in
a nonlinear fashion. For moments, there are two major consequences: first, correlations of
consumption and investment with the GDP tend to be higher in financial instability regimes
relative to tranquil times. The relative correlation between regimes for consumption is about
0.97 and is 0.865 for investment. Although the result for consumption may be an artifact of the

small sample, the difference for investment is substantial. The volatility implications are less
subtle. As one can expect, the volatility in a financial distress regime is much more pronounced
than in a normal regime. While the GDP tends to show an average increase of about 39% in
volatility in times of stress, consumption volatility magnifies by about 49% and investment by
about 95%, on average.8
     I also investigate whether the standard deviations of consumption and investment change
between regimes relative to the standard deviation of the GDP. This analysis is of interest since
it can shed some light on how intertemporal decisions are affected by tighter credit constraints.
The results, presented at the bottom of Table 2, show that as financial conditions deteriorate,
consumption and investment become even more volatile than the GDP. This means that
households and firms may face more difficulty in anticipating future income to buy consumption
and investment goods. These results echos those of the literature on the phenomenon called
excess volatility. Here, under financial distress, the excess volatility worsens.
     The better understand how financial frictions translate to the dynamics of macro-variables,
I now simulate shocks on the GDP and FSI and compute the GIRFs. The GIRFs are computed
within a regime but allowing for the possibility of a regime-switch. Starting with the histories
in one regime for a certain country, I simulate the evolution of the VAR system for 40 quarters

     These results are simple averages from the two filter methods. The term “about” is used to express both
the estimation and filter uncertainties.

with and without the shock of interest, compute the differences between the simulated paths,
and take the average responses. In such a context, the GIRF measures the responses of the
endogenous variables to a shocked variable at some horizon h within a specific regime r. The
confidence band is calculated from the draws of the VAR coefficients from the last 1,000 draws
in the Metropolis-within-Gibbs-sampler.
     Lets first analyze the effects of a positive shock of one standard deviation on the GDP gap.
The results are expressed in Figures 2. The first and most interesting point to note is that, for
almost all of the cases, the non-linear effects previously identified in business cycle moments are
also expressed in the GIRFs.9 Second, there are clearly heterogeneous responses both within
regimes as well as between regimes.

      To be specific about the nonlinear effects found in the data, the responses in the financial
distress regime are much larger than in the normal regime. Since accounting for these differences
by looking at such a large number of plots can be cumbersome, I calculate a measure of the
mean amplification effects in the sample caused by the presence of financial friction. I do so by
taking the mean difference between the responses in regimes 2 (stressful times) and 1 (normal
times). A positive sign means that the response in regime 2 is more pronounced than in regime
1, assuming that both have the same sign. I compute the differences both at impact—meaning
the impact in the first period—and on the cumulated impact, calculated from the cumulative
impulse responses. The results are shown in Table 3 expressed via the mean differences in the
sample. At impact, the responses of the GDP tend to be almost 89.8% higher in regime 2.
For the consumption, the difference is somewhat lower compared to the case of the GDP but
still quite pronounced: approximately 79.4% higher in regime 2. For investment, the difference

     As the impulses are calculated from different histories and coefficients, the superposition of confidence
interval is for illustration purposes, only.

between the regimes rises dramatically, reaching 134.4%. When the effects are cumulatively
summed over all of the simulated horizon, we see that the differences continue to increase. Our
result suggests a large amplification effect due to the presence of financial frictions, which is in
line with the financial accelerator literature (see, for example, Bernanke et al., 1999; Kiyotaki
and Moore, 1997).

      I repeat the previous exercise, but now for a positive one standard deviation shock on the
financial instability proxy. This shock is interpreted as worsening the financial conditions in a
specific regime. For brevity, the results are expressed for only four countries in Figure 3. As the
GIRFs make clear, poor financial conditions are pervasive to EMs. As the credit conditions
worsen, independently of the regime, GDP, consumption, and investment fall. Specifically, the
effects in regime 2 are more pronounced than in regime 1, with some countries experiencing
severe impacts, as in Malaysia and Romania in the figure. Complementing these findings, table 4
shows the mean differences in the responses both at impact and cumulated for the simulated
horizon. For the sample as a whole, tightening financial conditions—captured by a positive
shock to the Financial Stress Index—reduces the GDP, consumption, and investment in both
regimes. The negative effects are again more intense in the financial distress regime.

     Therefore, not only do the financial conditions imply regime switches with remarkable
frequency in the emerging economies, but also adverse financial shocks are propagated in a very
nonlinear and asymmetrical fashion in these economies.


4    Conclusion
This paper provides an empirical characterization of the dynamics imposed by financial instability
periods to the emerging markets’ business cycles. In a first step, I estimate a Financial Stress
Index (FSI) by employing dynamic factor methods and show that financial markets in emerging
economies frequently feature events of financial instability. Then, in a second step, I use a
Bayesian Panel Threshold VAR (BPT-VAR) model fed with the FSI estimated for each country
in the sample (25 emerging economies) to estimate a transition variable indicator that indicates
whether the economy is under a normal financial stability or under a financial distress period.
     The results suggest that financial instability may affect both the correlations and the
volatilities of two important macro-aggregates, consumption and investment, and can also
generate enormous asymmetries between regimes. In summary, when economies experience
tranquil times and good conditions in financial markets, their business cycle properties are
remarkably different from those in a financial distress period. During such events, EMs tend to
be much more volatile, and such behavior has implications not only for the second moments of
the data but also for the dynamics of the macro-variables. Moreover, shocks are propagated in a
regime-dependent fashion: in a financial instability regime, shocks to GDP have a larger (much
larger, in some cases) effect on real variables such as output, consumption, and investment.
Thus, I interpret these results as suggesting that financial frictions play a crucial role in the
business cycles in emerging markets. Within different channels, the amplification effects seems
to be crucial.
     Finally, it is important to point out that analysis here has important policy implications.
Policymakers in EMs may wish to introduce policies trying to reduce the likelihood and
magnitude of a financial crisis. From a theoretical point of view, one of such policies would be a
macroprudential capital control in the spirit of Jeanne and Korinek (2010) and Bianchi and
Mendoza (2017). In practice, such policies would require monitoring the leverage ratio in booms
and bust levying tax to affect the incentives of the agents to take on debt in riskier times.

B      Posterior Distribution of Prior Hyper-Parameters in
       Each Regime
The posterior distribution of the parameter λr is the tightness of the prior distribution of the
VAR coefficients for a regime r. Following Gelman (2006), we use a fairly loose prior to allow
the data speak. As suggested by Figure 5, the degree of cross-sectional shrinkage is similar and
well identified in the two regimes.

D      Estimation of the Financial Stress Index

This section briefly describes how we estimate the FSI. We construct all sub-index using monthly
data from various sources prior to converting them to a quarterly basis and taking the average
values in a quarter, as described in Table 5.

     Let xc,t be a vector of length nc × 1 , where t = 1, . . . , T c , containing financial sub-indexes
composing an overall financial index and hc,t = (gc,t , mc,t , πc,t )0 , where gt is the GDP growth in
country c, mt is the growth of M 1, and πt is the inflation rate. We assume a TVP-FAVAR with
the following form:

that uc,t ∼ N (0, Vc,t ) and εc,t ∼ N (0, Qc,t ), where Vt e Qt are time varying. The identification is
based on the commonly used hypothesis that Vt is a diagonal matrix, such that ut is a vector of
idiosyncratic shocks, and fc,t has all relevant information pertaining to financial variables. For
each country, we also assume that the time-varying parameters evolve as random walks of the
form:
