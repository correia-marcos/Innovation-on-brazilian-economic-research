 Resumo: O objetivo principal deste trabalho é estimar as preferências do Banco Central do Brasil no
período pós metas de inflação (janeiro 2000 a junho de 2011), usando um modelo DSGE com
fundamentos microeconômicos para uma pequena economia aberta, tomando como base especialmente
o trabalho de Kam, Lees e Liu (2009). O modelo utilizado neste trabalho considera que o Banco
Central minimiza uma função perda, levando em consideração o desvio da inflação em relação a meta,
a estabilização do produto, a suavização da taxa de juros e, distintamente dos trabalhos anteriores, a
taxa de câmbio. Os resultados permitem afirmar que a maior preocupação da autoridade monetária no
período foi com a estabilização da inflação, seguida pela suavização da taxa de juros, estabilização do
produto e, por último, a estabilização da taxa de câmbio.

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to estimate the preferences of the Central Bank of
Brazil after the inflation targeting regime (January 2000 to June 2011), using a DSGE model with
microeconomic foundations for a small open economy, based especially on the work of Kam, Lees
and Liu (2009). The model used in this study considers that the Central Bank minimizes a loss
function, taking into account the deviation of inflation from its target, output stabilization, the
interest rate smoothing and, unlike the previous works, the exchange rate. The results allow us to
affirm that the major concern of the monetary authority in the period was the stabilization of
inflation, followed by interest rate smoothing, output stabilization and, finally, exchange rate
stabilization.

1. Introduction and Justification for the Study

        One of the major developments in macroeconomics in the past few decades has been
theadoptionof the intertemporal utility maximization paradigmand its implementation in dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, which are currently the predominant approach to
macroeconomic analysis, not only among scholars, butincreasingly among Central
Banksworldwide.
        In DSGE models, economic agents (consumers andfirms) are treated as optimizing agents.
Thus, families maximizeutilityconditional on some given budget constraint and firms
maximizetheir profits with the applicable constraints. However, the Central Bank’s behavior is
often described asa special case, i.e., by a monetary policy rule- the Taylor rule. Unlike other
agents, mostly through DSGE models, the Central Bankdoes not solveits optimization problem.
The Taylor rule,the standard tool for assessing the behavior of Central Banks, empirically
describes the monetary authority’s response to macroeconomic variables. Although it was
proposed from a purely empirical perspective, the Taylor rule has a theoretical basis, being the
solution to a restricted optimization problem, where the Central Bank minimizes a quadratic loss
function.1This way, the coefficients estimatedin a reaction function are rather complex
combinationsof preference parameters (coefficients of the objective function) of the monetary
authority and structural parameters of the model. Therefore, the coefficients found in the reaction
function are reduced-form estimatesand do not describe the structural characteristics of the
monetary policy, and are then not useful for assessing issuesconcerned with the process of
monetary policyformulation.
        The aim of the present paper is to symmetricallydeal with the monetary authority in a
DSGE model, i.e., to assume that the Central Bank is also an optimizing agent and minimizes its
loss function conditional on economic constraintsand, based on this problem, to estimate the
monetary authority’s preferences. Few works used a similar approach to the international case.
Ilbas (2010b) and Ilbas (2010a) estimate FED’s preferencesand the preferences for the euro zone,
respectively, following the model proposed by Smets and Wouters (2003), under commitment.
Kam, Lees and Liu (2009), on the other hand, estimate the central bank preferencesfor three of the
major small open economies that operate under the inflation targeting regime: Australia,
Canadaand New Zealand. The authors use a quadratic loss function and the model put forward by
Monacelli (2005) as a constraint on the optimization problem, taking into account the discretionary
case.In the Central Bank’s loss function, the following variables are used as arguments: deviation
of inflation, of output, interest rate smoothing, and exchange rate. Remo and Vasícek (2009) do the
same for the Central Bank of the Czech Republic, but they use commitment instead. In the loss
function, the authors do not regard the exchange rate as argument.
        Getting to know the Central Bank’s preferences is of utmost importance. Many inflation
episodes, for instance, may arise from the monetary authority’s attempt to stabilize outputabove its
natural rate. Moreover, the heavier the relative weight of output on the loss function, the larger the
inflationary bias towards the economy. According to Castelnuovo and Surico (2003, p. 336),
knowing the monetary policy preferences allows assessingits performance in a more accurate
fashion, since it is possible to know whether the obtained result is that which was actuallysought
by the Central Bank or whether it represents just a random gain from favorable macroeconomic
conditions.
        In Brazil, Aragon and Portugal (2009) were the first authors to investigate the monetary
authority’s preferences. In a calibration exercise of the loss function, the authors, using a
backward-looking model, choose preference parameter values that minimize the deviationbetween
the simulated optimal path and the actual path of the Selic rate. Given that in a calibration exercise,
inference would not be possible, the optimal structure is employed to estimate preferences through
the maximum likelihood method.The results indicate that the Central Bank of Brazil places a

    Proposed by Svensson (1996).
heavier weighton the inflation rateand that the concern with interest rate smoothing isdeeper than
with the output gap. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the maximum likelihood estimation
exercise the loss function parameterswere not significant. This fact, as pointed out by the authors,
might have occurred owing to the small sample size.
        Palma and Portugal (2011) used a standard new-Keynesian modelwith forward-looking
expectations proposed by Givens (2010) to estimate the monetary authority’s preferences in
Brazilduring the inflation targeting regime, taking into account a closed economy.2Assuming
rational expectations, it is necessary tomake a key distinction about how agents’ expectations are
dealt with in the optimization problem, i.e., by telling commitment and discretion apart. The main
differencebetween these two possibilities lies in how agents’ expectations aretreated in the Central
Bank’s optimization problem. Equilibrium in both cases takes the form of a state-space model that
can be estimated by maximum likelihood using the Kalman filter. The results show that the
monetary authority places a heavier weight on inflation stabilization, followed by interest rate
smoothingand by output stabilization. In addition, the results obtained by the authors indicate that
a discretionary policyis more consistentwith the data available for the analyzed period.
The present paper does innovate, offering a one-of-a-kind study for the Brazilian case, by using a
DSGE model, which is more consistent with the optimization and rational expectations approach.
        The utilization of forward-looking expectationshighlights the central role of expectations
formation, especially under the inflation targeting regime, underscoring the importance of future
events for the present time. Furthermore, the use of Bayesian methods in the estimation process is
quite attractive due to theshort duration of the sample period.
        The aim of the present paperis to use the Bayesian approach to estimate the monetary
authority’s preferencesbased on a DSGE model, where all structural equations result from optimal
decisionsmade by private agents and policymakers in a discretionary context.3The intention is to
contribute to improving the insight into monetary policy conduct in Brazil under the inflation
targeting regime,managing to remedy some shortcomings seen in previous works on the same
topic. The Bayesian approach is quite attractive for this case, given that the sample for the inflation
targeting regime is somewhat small.
        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology
used, with a brief description of DSGE models and their estimation by Bayesian methods. Section
3 outlines the theoretical model used in the present paper, which is based chiefly on Kam, Lees
and Liu (2009). Section 4 presents the data and the selection of priors, as well as the results.
Section 5 concludes.

2. Method

2.1. DSGE Models

        In the 1960s and 1970s, the large-scale macroeconomic models (systems of equations)
arose as an attractive tool for policymakers and economists. However, these models were harshly
criticizedon the grounds of their empirical, and mainly theoretical, foundations, since they were
especiallysubject to Lucas (1976) critique, according to which, changes in economic policymodify
agents’ expectationsand, in turn,alter the parameters of economic models. The implications for the
systems of equations models arecatastrophic, as these models are believed to beof little value.
        As an alternative, Kydland and Prescott (1982) proposed the first model that used a DSGE
approach, or thereal business cycle (RBC)approach tomacroeconomic modeling. Nonetheless, total
price flexibility was considered at first, implying thatmonetary authority’s actionsdo notinfluence

   The authors tried to minimize this constraint by using a monetary conditions index (MCI) as monetary policy
instrument, which is a weighted average between the interest rate and the exchange rate, in lieu of interest rates.
However, the results did not vary significantly.

real variables. Because of that, these models were initially unattractive for Central Banks and other
organizations.
        With the advent of nominal and real rigidities in the 1990s, besides imperfect competition
in DSGE models, they eventually proved to be veryuseful in capturing important characteristics of
macroeconomic time series, unlike their predecessor (the RBC models proposed by Kydland and
Prescott). Aside from that, improvements in quantitative methods werekey toarousing the interest
in these models. Since then, these models have been constantly improved and, currently,
DSGEmodels are the standard tool for macroeconometricanalysis, and can be used for several
purposes,such as estimation, prediction, comparison of models, identification of shocksand
analysis of economic policies. The addition of expectations to these models renders them
lessvulnerable to Lucas critique than conventional models, where expectations are not used orare
used in a limited way.
         DSGE models are open to many criticisms, though. One of their limitations is that they
develop strong hypotheses about the agents’ rationality. In addition, the heterogeneity of
individuals is not taken into proper consideration.
        In Brazil, improvements in DSGE models are particularly interesting given the adoption of
the inflation targeting regime. Monetary policy is not randomly implemented and the Central
Bankneeds a vast array of modelsand toolsto support its decisions, and DSGE models have taken
onan increasingly important role.

2.2. Estimation of DSGE models4

        The estimation of DSGE models poses several challenges, since their parameters are highly
nonlinear. Initially, these models were solved by calibration, a technique that basically consists in
setting parameter values based on some prior knowledge. For formal estimation, one of the first
approaches was the generalized method of moments, which includes endogenous and
expectational variables, found in the relationships defined by the model. However, this strategy
was not so robust in that it may be necessary to use quite big samples to have useful inferences.
        Notwithstanding the numerous criticisms, Bayesian methods have become quite
popularand are particularly suitable for the estimation of the modelscontemplated herein. Simply
put, Bayesian statistic can be considered a mix of calibration and the maximum likelihood
principle. Uncertainty, as well as previous knowledge about the model and its parameters, is
described by prior probabilities. Comparison with the data via the likelihood function leads to the
revision of these probabilities, yielding the posterior probabilities.

       A DSGE model is basically a nonlinear system of equations in expectational differences,
which can be written in the following general matrix form:

   ,  ,  ,  ,       =0                        (2.1)

               = Ω
yt = vector of endogenous variables

        As observed above, the model is stochastic, forward-looking and nonlinear. Regardless of
the estimation method, it is necessary to solve this model first andto obtain its reduced form. To do
that, a linear approximation to the model is performed at first and, through methods for the

solution of rational expectations models, a solution is found to the linear system, expressed in
terms of deviations from the steady state. Some of the solution methods frequently usedare:
Blanchard and Kahn, Sims, Klein, undetermined coefficients, among others.5
       Assuming there is a unique stable and invariant solution, it is given by an equation in
nonlinear stochastic differences, where the endogenous variables are written as a function of their
previous levels and of the contemporaneous structural shocks:

 =   , 
 is a set of policy functions.
                                                                              (2.2)


       In general, it is not possible to obtain a closed solution to the model, and (local or global)

        Substituting (2.2) into (2.1) forytand yt+1:

       Each equation in (2.1) can then be approximated by the expected value of a Taylor
expansion of its logarithm around the steady state (log-linearization). The equations in (2.1) and
(2.2) can be approximated,using the following system (variables with acaretover them stand for
percentage deviations of the original variablesfrom their steady state):

        The model in its linearized form can be solved with the help of the Dynare software in
order to obtain its representation in its reduced state-space form. As a matter of fact, a series of
complex algebraic procedures is needed.8After finding the solution to the model in terms of its
policy functions, one can write it in state-space form:

∗ = ' + ()
 = * + (
                                              measurement equation
                                             state equation

        Maximum likelihood estimation requires thatthe likelihood function be constructed and
assessed based on the structural parameters.This is complicated when the model includes
unobservable state variables. In this case, the Kalman filter, for instance, allows making inferences
about the unobservable state vectorand assessing the joint likelihood function of observable
endogenous variables, yielding consistent and asymptotically normal estimatesfor the parameters
of interest.

  For a detailed description of these procedures, see Klein (2000) and Sims (2002).
        If the DSGE model isstochastically singular (more observable variables than random
shocks), maximum likelihood estimation often fails. When that occurs, two strategies can be
considered: i) using at most as many observable variables as the number of structural shocks; ii)
adding error terms in the state-space observation equation.
        Nevertheless, empirical experience has demonstrated that it is too difficult to estimate a
model by the maximum likelihood method. Usually, the function is flat in certain directions,
giving rise to important identification problems. The solution came from Bayesian methods, where
the identification problem is not a limiting factor.
        The Bayesian statistic basically consists intreatingthe parameters as random variables. In
the case of structural models, the use of Bayesian methods is a lot more attractive, since there is an
interpretation for the parameters that are being estimated,facilitating the selection of priors.
        The specification of priors for the parametersbegins with the selection of the functional
form that is more suitable for the distribution. For example, one can use the possible interval for
the parameter values as reference. Thus, the inverse gamma distribution is used for parameters
with only positive values, the beta distribution is reserved forparameterswith values between 0 and
1 and normal distribution is used for unrestricted parameter values. The use ofnon-informative
priors (uniform distribution) is also possible.
With the likelihood function and the specification of priors, it is possible to estimate the posterior
distributions, which represent the probabilities associated with different parameter valuesafter
observation of the data. Basically, the posteriorsare updates of beliefs, represented by the priors,
based on additional information provided by variables in the sample. The determination of
posteriors basically consists of the application of the widely known Bayes’ Theorem:

                                             + ∗        + ∗

+ ∗ | = likelihood function
where:

+ = informative priors
+ ∗ = marginal density function of the sample.
Given that+ ∗ does not rely on the vector of parameters, it can be treated as a constantand the

posteriorcan be written as

where/| ∗ is known as the posteriorkernel and is proportional to the posteriordeterminedby

        The determination of posteriors includes the calculation of quite nontrivial integrals and
computationally intensive numerical methods are needed. TheMarkov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods allow for this calculation. The basic idea of this method is to construct a
Markov chain with state spaces in parametric space, which is easy to simulate and whose
equilibrium distributionis given exactly by the posterior distribution. The Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm is one of the possibilities in this case.This algorithm is used herein and is summarized in

       Note that the computational cost of the implementation of DSGE models is relatively low.
Using the Dynare software, the relevant issue focuses on the interpretation of results rather than on
their mechanics.

3. Theoretical Model


        The model used herein is based on the framework developed byGali and Monacelli (2005),
Monacelli (2005) and Justiniano and Preston (2010), which has been widely used for the analysis
of fiscal and monetary policies by the central banks of small open economies(Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, Czech Republic, Brazil, etc.). In the original model, monetary policy is
described by an empirical Taylor rule. FollowingIlbas (2010a, 2010b),and mainlyKam, Lees and
Liu (2009), this hypothesis will be abandoned and we will assume that the monetary authority
optimizes a quadratic loss function in a discretionary fashion,in accordance with the results
obtained by Palma and Portugal (2011). This implies that the monetary authority reoptimizes the
loss functionin each period, taking the agents’ expectations as given.9
        The aggregate demand and supply curvesare derived from the agents’ optimization
problem (families and firms, respectively) with forward-looking expectations. The source of real
rigidityis the consumption habit persistence and that of the nominal rigidity is the indexation to the
previous inflation, as well as the hypothesis of monopolistic competitionwith sticky prices for
domestic and importing firms. Moreover, one should consider the imperfectexchange rate pass-
through.10Finally, we add the Central Bank’s optimization problem instead of the Taylor rules to
describe the behavior of the monetary policy. The model is therefore made up of four agents:
families, domestic firms, importing firms and the monetary authority.

 Note that the inflation targeting regime is an instrument that increases transparency, communication and coherence of
the monetary policy, not necessarily consisting of a conventional strict commitment system (Bernanke and Mishkin,
1997). In fact, this regime is compatiblewith the discretionary behavior of the monetary policy. According to
Mendonça (2001), owing to the transparency of the inflation targeting regime, it is possible to use discretionary
policies without loss of credibility of the monetary authority.

   For further reading on this topic, see, for instance, Goldfajn and Werlang (2000).In short, with the imperfect
exchange rate pass-through, importers do not immediately adjust the domestic price of importsin response to exchange
ratefluctuations.

3.2.2. Importing firms

       The basic idea is the same as for domestic firms and thus this section will be quite short.
The model considers the monopolistic competition between importers and price setting à la Calvo.
Furthermore, a gap is assumed between the price of imported goods denominated in domestic
currency and the domestic price of imported goods, which can be explained by the fact that
importing firms purchase imported goods at globally competitive prices. However, in the domestic
economy, these firms are monopolistically competitive, redistributing these goods. This gap is
given in log-linear terms by:

R, = x + +∗ − +R,                                                               (3.10)

The solution to the optimization problem of importing firms (as in the previous section) leads to
the Phillips curve for imported goods inflation, given by:

~R, = 2>o ~R, − }R ~R, @ + }R ~R,              + R >R, + jR, @             (3.11)

3.3. Terms of trade, real exchange rate and equilibrium

In equilibrium, domestic output is equal to the total domestic demand (domestic and foreign

 = H, + H,
demand) for produced goods, which in log-linear terms yields:
             ∗

Performing the necessary substitutions, we get:

 = 2 − U U_ + 1 − U  + U_R, + U∗                                (3.13)

        It is also possible to derive a relationship between terms of trade ( ), the real exchange rate
(1 ) and the gap in the law of one price (R, ), given by:12

for simplicity, treated as exogenous stochastic processes.

function,Δ =  −  , is justifiable by the fact that the monetary authority also worries about
variables in the model are expressed as deviations from their mean. The last term of the loss


we allow for a shock to this variable, given by  ~F0, O ), which allows capturing the imperfect
the financial stability or for considering the inertial behavior of the policy instrument.In addition,

ability of the Central Bankto control the nominal interest rate. The inclusion of the exchange rate
in the Central Bank’s loss functionallows us to answer whether this variable is taken into
consideration in the monetary authority’s optimization problem.
        The monetary authority’s goal is to minimize the loss function, subject to structural
economic equations(3.15)-(3.23), underdiscretion. The solution to the problem is found using
thealgorithm proposed by Dennis (2004). In sum, the concept of Markov perfect equilibrium is
used, where the Central Banknowadays (i.e., its contemporaneous decisions) is considered a
Stackelberg leader and the private agents and the future Central Bank’s actions are regarded as
Stackelberg followers.

   This quadratic function combined with linear restrictions produces linear decision rules. Moreover, it may represent
a second-order approximation to the utility function of the representative agent.
        The series will be expressed as deviations from the sample mean and are available
atwww.ipeadata.gov.br,on the website of the Central Bank of Brazil atwww.bcb.gov.br and on the
website of IBGE atwww.ibge.gov.br. The variables were seasonally adjustedand the trend was
removed using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter.
        Table 4.1 shows the prior distributionof the parametersto be estimated. The selection of
priors takes into account mainly the interval of variation of each parameter. Conventionally, we
use the beta distributionfor parameters that areon the interval [0,1],the inverse gamma distribution
for those on the interval [0, ∞)and the gamma distribution for the remaining cases.

        As shown by the results above, the Central Bankattaches greater valueto the stabilization of
inflation around its target(reference value, with weight equal to 1), followed by interest rate
smoothing(0.63), by output stabilization(0.51)and, finally, by exchange rate stabilization(0.19).
The absolute weights are shown in table 4.1. Table 4.2 makes a comparison with previous results
found in the literature. The order of parameter values does not change from one study to the other,
but the magnitude is quite different.This is not a surprising result because we use a DSGE model,
unlike other studies, which were conventional econometric models. In addition, the model used in
this paper takes into account a small open economy, contrary to the previous studies. Palma
andPortugal (2011) used a closed economy model and Aragon and Portugal (2009) employed only
a random walk to describe the exchange rate behavior.
        The results obtained herein show that the monetary authority attaches great weightto
inflation stabilization, but a lower weight than those observed earlier. Moreover, note that there is
a very deep concern with interest rate smoothing, with similar results to those published in the
international literature. Kam, Lees and Liu (2009)found similar results for other “small open
economies” that adopt the inflation targeting regime: Australia, Canadaand New Zealand. Also
noteworthyis the fact that the weight given to output stabilizationis significantly heavier than
thatattached in previous studies. This can be accounted for by the larger sample size used. In
recent times, the Central Bank has apparentlygiven a larger weight to output gap, which may be
helping to increase the weight of this variable in the loss function.
        Conversely, the positive weight for the exchange rate smoothing parametercan be seen as
an attempt toreduce the volatility of inflation in the short run, i.e., the weight of exchange in the
reaction functionis indirectly associated with inflation control.
        The habit formation parameter, estimated at 0.89, shows the relevance of habit formationto
Brazil. Silveira (2008) reports values for the first-order habit persistence between 0.55 and 0.81.
Silva and Portugal (2010) obtain a value of 0.9562, and a value of 0.74 for the SAMBA model for
Brazil. According to Cavalcanti and Vereda (2011, p. 16), there are few references about
persistence values for Brazil, since most recent works do not take this characteristic into
consideration.Nonetheless, the value found herein is consistent with the recent literature.
        The intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption (estimated at 0.92, σ = 1.09) is
relatively higher than the values reported in the literature. Silveira (2008) found a value of 0.48,
and concluded that the aggregate demand responds to changes in the real interest rate, representing
the conventional and effective monetary policy transmission mechanism in the Brazilian economy.
Silva and Portugal (2010) also find lower values for the elasticity of substitution(1.2234, which
implies an elasticity of 0.8174). On the other hand, the SAMBA model estimates this parameter
at0.77 (σ = 1.30). The result indicates thatthe tendency towards smoothing consumption in Brazil
is quite strongand larger than in the euro zone (Silva and Portugal, 2010). As stated by Silveira
(2008, p. 350), due to the large variability of the results, it is not possible to draw a definitive
conclusion for this parameter. Specifically in our case, the posterior distribution is not very
different from the prior one, probably indicatingpoor identification of this parameter.16
        The elasticity of labor supplywas estimatedat 0.58 ( = 1.71). Silveira (2008) found a
relatively larger value, 0.77 ( = 1.30), as well as Gouvea et al. (2011), whoobtained 0.338 for this
parameter (which implies an elasticity of 2.96). Yet, as suggested by the international literature,
this value should be lower, as the one found herein. Silva and Portugal (2010)obtained a value of
= 1.8128 (elasticity of 0.55), quite close to the one estimated in this paper. This parameter can be
interpreted asthe percentage change in labor supply given by a percentage change in real wage.
The low value obtained here compared to other studies could refer to the specificity of rigidity in
the Brazilian labor market.
        The elasticity of substitution between domestic and imported goods was estimated at0.13,
which indicates poor chances of substitution among these goods. The estimates for price stickiness
parameters (Calvo) are consistent with the referenced literature. For the Brazilian economy, this
elasticity was estimated at 0.66 and for the U.S. economy,at 0.87. The estimates for the backward-
looking components of the Phillips curve were extremely low. The persistence parameters of
exogenous processes are very high and most of themmatch those estimates described in the

        The major aim of this paper was to estimate the Central Bank preferences using a DSGE
model for a small open economy, based chiefly on the work of Kam, Lees and Liu (2009). This
topic has been investigated only recently for the Brazilian caseand, to the best of our knowledge,
only two studies estimated the preferences of the Central Bank of Brazil: Aragon and Portugal
(2009) and Palma and Portugal (2011). The present study innovatesin relation to both by
considering a DSGE model and extending the work of Palma and Portugal (2011), for a small
open economy. Additionally, the use of the exchange rate variable in the Central Bank’s loss
function isa noveltyfor the Brazilian case.
        The model was estimated using quarterly data (in order to minimize measurement errors
and the number of lags in the model) in the period that followed the inflation targeting
regime(January 2000 to June 2011).Most of the results obtained for the structural economic
parameters are consistent with the main previous studies that use DSGE models to assess issues
related to the Brazilian economy.
        As to the preference parameters, it is possible to assert that the Central Bank attaches
heavier weight to the stabilization of inflation around its target, but that it is also interested in
interest rate smoothing, output stabilization and exchange rate stabilization, in this strict order.
The study sought to improve the estimation of Central Bank preferences. To achieve that, a DSGE
model with microeconomic foundations for a small open economy was used, consistent with the
optimization and rational expectations approaches.Unlike most DSGE models, and an innovation

     As pointed out by Castro et al. (2011), the identification of this parameter is often cumbersome.
for the Brazilian case, the monetary authority was regarded also as an optimizing agent. Contrary
to other agents (families and firms, for example), in most of the studies using DSGE models, the
Central Bank does not solve its optimization problem, and its behavior is described through the
Taylor rule.
        Some extensions to this study can and should be conducted in the future in order to
improve and shed further light upon this important topic. One of them consists in including some
elements of the SAMBA model, notably an equation for the inflation targetthat best describes the
behavior of the Brazilian economy. In addition, as Palma and Portugal (2011) did, a version of the
commitment model could be estimatedso as to check which of the two cases (commitments ×
discretion) best suits the Brazilian case.
