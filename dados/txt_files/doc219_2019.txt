     This paper aims to analyze whether the installation of Pacifying Police Units (UPPs) in some
     slums (also called favelas) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, resulted in an overflow of violence to
     neighboring areas. The key hypothesis is that when a crime crackdown policy is implemented in
     a community, rather than reducing illicit activity, it merely partially shifts it to other locations
     with similar characteristics. Using a Spatial Difference-in-Differences (SDID) estimator that
     allows the modeling of a possible spillover effect, we show that Police Districts (PDs) that
     received UPPs experienced a decrease in drug trade-related crime, including rates of intentional
     homicide, violent crime, and car thefts. On the other hand, the opposite effect occurred in
     neighboring PDs that did not receive UPPs.

     Este trabalho tem como objetivo analisar se a instalação de Unidades de Polícia Pacificadora
     (UPPs) em algumas favelas no Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, resultou em um transbordamento da vi-
     olência para as áreas vizinhas. A hipótese chave é que, quando uma política de repressão ao
     crime é implementada em uma comunidade, em vez de reduzir a atividade ilícita, ela é trans-
     ferida parcialmente para outros locais com características semelhantes. Usando um estimador
     de Diferenças em Diferenças Espaciais (SDID) que permite modelar um possível efeito de trans-
     bordamento, mostramos que os Distritos Policiais (DPs) que receberam UPPs experimentaram
     uma diminuição no crime relacionado ao tráfico de drogas, incluindo taxas de homicídio doloso,
     letalidade violenta e roubo de carros. Por outro lado, o efeito oposto ocorreu em DPs vizinhos
     que não receberam UPPs.

1 Introduction
    Some Brazilian cities are internationally recognized for their natural and urban beauty, attracting
thousands of tourists annually. This is true of Rio de Janeiro, known as “the wonderful city”. Despite
its abundant attractions, Rio de Janeiro faces high rates of violence and crime according to United
Nations (UN) criteria1 , particularly associated with drug trafficking, gang and militia activity. With
6.5 million people, the city witnessed more than 4,000 homicides (∼ 3.7 murders per day) between
2016 and 2018. The situation in the capital was even worse in the early 1990s through 2000 with
more than 2,900 murders per year, reflected in homicide rate of 45 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.
    Since 2000, several crime crackdown policies were tested, and one was implemented most promi-
nently: Pacifying Police Units (UPPs). In 2008, Rio de Janeiro was preparing to compete to host the
2016 Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Hence, it became urgent to reduce rates of violence
before these events. The UPPs were intended to permanently reclaim areas previously dominated by
drug trafficking and to pacify these areas (CARDOSO et al., 2016). As previous policies had failed
to mitigate this problem (CANO; BORGES; RIBEIRO, 2012), the UPPs were met with distrust by
the people of Rio de Janeiro. However, the number of violent crimes, particularly in those slums that
received the UPPs, began to decrease.
    Some literature has investigated the effectiveness of UPPs. In regions covered by UPPs, there
have been short-term positive impacts, including reductions in violent and property crime (BUTELLI,
2015), lethal police violence (MAGALONI; FRANCO; MELO, 2015), conflicts among drug dealers
and between police and criminals (VAZ, 2014), and conflicts between gangs (MONTEIRO; ROCHA,
2017).
    However, these studies address the effects in regions that received such units, while possible spil-
lover to other regions has been neglected.2 It remains unclear whether crime reductions in localities
covered by UPPs have been accompanied by increased crime rates in neighboring regions. Analysis
of this topic is the main contribution of this paper, which seeks to verify if the policy of UPP imple-
mentation has resulted in a spillover of crime to neighboring regions within Rio de Janeiro using a
spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) methodology.
    This article is structured into five sections, including this introduction. Section 2 includes a
literature review and presents the study’s theoretical background, discussing causes of spillover and
empirical analyses of this theme. In section 3, we describe the characteristics of the UPP program
in Rio de Janeiro. Section 4 presents the empirical dataset and strategies used in the analysis. In
section 5, we show the results obtained through the estimation of the traditional model, difference-
in-differences, and spatial difference-in-differences. The final section presents concluding remarks.


2 Spatial Concentration and Spillover of Crime
    According to Becker (1968), there are two markets: one consists of legal activities, and the other is
1
    The UN considers homicide rate to be at an epidemic level when it is greater than 10 homicides per 100,000 inha-
    bitants. See <https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf>

    The exception is Tealde (2015) that consider crime displacement from pacified to non-pacified favelas.

based on criminal activities. Acting rationally, an agent will commit a crime if the expected (usually,
monetary) utility associated with the criminal act’s discounted cost (eg, monetary fines or disutility
from being incarcerated) exceeds the utility they would obtain using their time and other resources
in legal activities.
    Thus, the interaction of three factors can serve to reduce crime: a) increased moral cost of criminal
activity; b) increased probability that an individual will be arrested through sentence enhancements
and investments in police manpower, policing intensity, and prisons; c) reduced economic incentives to
engage in criminal activity through greater opportunities in the labor market (low unemployment rate
and/or relevant market wage). Becker’s seminal work served as a guide for the empirical literature
on crime, which has largely analyzed how crime rates respond to the expected costs and benefits of
illegal activity activity (EHRLICH, 1973; EHRLICH, 1996; SJOQUIST, 1973).
    In this section, we illustrate this idea through reference to several papers that aim to model the
spillover effect. According to this literature, beyond analyzing the expected costs and benefits of
crime, it is possible to identify factors responsible for the occurrence of crime in one particular region
and not in others. Suppose that there are only two neighborhoods (A and B), as shown in Figure
1. These regions can be considered similar in location, policing, demographics, and wealth. Overall,
these regions are equally attractive as crime targets ex ante (DEUTSCH; HAKIM; WEINBLATT,
1984; HELSLEY; STRANGE, 1999).

                                             B                          A

                                    Figure 1 – Simplified Migration Scheme
     Consider that crimes in these communities are generally related to drug trafficking. Therefore,
in addition to the drug trafficking itself, crimes related to this activity (such as murder, assault,
and robbery) are the most frequent in these regions. A potential criminal decides where to operate
(A or B). If there is perfect mobility of crime between these neighboring regions, the decision to
commit crime in each of these locations will be made by comparing the crime return in each region
(SANTOS; FILHO, 2011).3
     Following Freeman, Grogger and Sonstelie (1996), suppose that the probability of arrest is a func-
tion of the police resources (or even police activity), mi , and the number crimes in the neighborhood
i ∈ {A, B}, ni . The probability of arrest increases if police resources increase and the number of
observed crimes in that region decreases (because the greater the crime in an area, the smaller the
chance, holding police resources constant, that a criminal will be identified as committing a single
crime and therefore be arrested).4
     To calculate the return on a crime, note that the wealth obtained from illegitimate pursuits (z)
is limited by the total resources of the victim (in our case, drug users). The higher the number of
competing drug traffickers in a locality, the lower the return on drug sales, holding demand constant.
3
    Although this flow of crime is free, Deutsch, Hakim and Weinblatt (1984) point out that criminals prefer to commit
    crimes in places close to their home. In the case of drug trafficking, this relationship seems to be even stronger.
4
    As the probability of arrest and the occurrence of crime are inversely correlated, it should be noted that the
    occurrence of crime decreases with an increase in police resources.




                                                           3
Therefore, a decreasing value of z should decrease the number of crimes. Thus, the expected return
from criminal activity in the i locality is:

                                     v(mi , ni ) = (1 − p(mi , ni ))z(ni )                              (1)
    If the number of crimes is held constant (ni ), and a crime crackdown is observed in region A
(i.e., increased police activity), it will be less attractive to engage in illicit activities in that region
compared to its neighbor, region B. Crime could be transferred to and intensified in region B if police
activity remained unchanged in that region, holding everything else constant. Therefore, given the
crime crackdown in region A, crime may increase in region B for two reasons. First, the chances of
arrest have relatively decreased in region B, leading to increased crime there. Given this increase
in illicit activity, the chances of arrest comparatively fall even more, as the likelihood of criminals
being identified decreases. Second, the increase in drug dealers in a place where demand is constant
reduces the utility of crime, which generates conflicts between the criminals. Thus, by generating
incentives for migration and conflicts in other areas, the crime crackdown in region A imposes the
negative externalities inherent in criminal activities on the residents of region B.
    This spillover (or non-complete migration, as defined by Cano, Borges and Ribeiro (2012)), could
be less severe than the crimes originally committed. However, the authors emphasize that failure
to consider the spillover effect in evaluations of the impact of a crime crackdown program results
in overestimation of the program impact. Some authors have addressed this problem. For instance,
Dell (2015) analyzed how a policy of drug trafficking repression may have shifted illicit activities
to other Mexican regions. She analyzed how the election of a conservative party in Mexico, which
implemented policies to crack down on trafficking in certain regions, may have diverted the route of
trafficking and increased violence along alternative routes.
    Crime spillover or displacement is not exclusive to drug-related crimes. Cerezo (2013), who
analyzed the effects of the installation of cameras on certain streets of Malaga, Spain, on property
crime (robberies and burglaries) and crimes against people, found a significant decrease in these
crimes. Nevertheless, nearby streets with similar characteristics presented an increase in property
crimes. Another crime displacement case was observed in Gonzalez-Navarro (2013). The introduction
of a technology that inhibits car theft in some Mexican states has been effective in reducing theft of
these vehicles. However, the author also found evidence that car theft risk had been geographically
displaced to neighboring states in which these technologies were not present.
    Two articles in particular have employed the same Spatial Difference-in-Differences methodology
proposed in this paper. Canavire-Bacarreza et al. (2016) analyzed the effects of the Metrocable transit
innovation in Medellín, Colombia, on crime through two mechanisms: reducing travel costs and
increasing the probability of apprehension. The authors verified a positive spillover effect (reduced
violence) of this new system in the vicinity of the stations. Verbitsky-Savitz and Raudenbush (2012)
evaluated the effects of Chicago’s community policing program on neighborhood crime rates using a
generalized three-level linear hierarchical model, finding a negative externality of the policy.
    The hypotheses adopted in this paper, therefore, is that after a crackdown program, drug dealers
in Rio de Janeiro may have adopted new strategies, such as reorganization and installation in other


                                                      4
neighborhoods, including Baixada Fluminense and Nova Iguaçu (MAGALONI; FRANCO; MELO,
2015; DELL, 2015). When this illicit activity moves to neighboring regions, local violence skyrockets
due to gang conflicts, increasing individuals’ safety concerns and threats in the conflict’s location
(MONTEIRO; ROCHA, 2017).


3 Pacifying Police Units (UPPs) Program
    The Pacifying Police Units (UPPs) program was introduced in 2008 and, since then, more than
USD 1 billion has been invested in it (through construction of police stations and conservation of
UPP areas). This program was intended to allow the state to recover control of territories previously
dominated by drug traffickers and to pacify those regions (CARDOSO et al., 2016). In addition, as
important sporting events hosted by the city of Rio de Janeiro including the 2014 FIFA World Cup
and the 2016 Olympic Games were approaching, the authorities were pledged to demonstrating their
commitment and ability to rapidly reduce the existing violence.
    Thus, the UPP implementation policy was presented as a way, at least in the short term, to reduce
violence levels in Rio de Janeiro, especially in favelas (slums) dominated by drug trafficking. The
policy aimed to guarantee security for the city’s population and tourists, both those who regularly
visited the region and those that would come as a result of the sporting events. The program was
inaugurated on December 19, 2008 with the UPP in Santa Marta, a small and relatively peaceful
community in the South Zone of the city (MAGALONI; FRANCO; MELO, 2015). Over more than
10 years of the program, 38 UPPs were installed. After a favela’s occupation by Special Operation
Forces (BOPE) or the army, which confronted and drove out traffickers and criminal organizations,
a permanent police unit would be installed, insuring an intense local police presence. Thereafter, a
UPP Social program would be organized, which aimed to guarantee access to basic social elements,
such as transportation, education, and healthcare.
    Figure 2 presents a map of Rio de Janeiro State, where we can see the area controlled by each UPP
and the units’ installation order. The selection of communities that would receive the first units is
discussed in Magaloni, Franco and Melo (2015). The authors mention that unlike other approaches,
such as hot-spot policing, the UPP interventions were not initially based on the high incidence of
violence in these communities. The first favelas to receive this program were located in the southern
zone of the capital, a relatively peaceful and wealthy place compared to other regions. For example,
as noted by Monteiro and Rocha (2017), in 2009, the southern zone registered a homicide rate of
6.6 per 100,00 inhabitants, while the northern zone of the city experienced 60.3 deaths per 100,000
inhabitants. Nonetheless, the southern region received most of the first ten UPPs installed.
    Cano, Borges and Ribeiro (2012) mention that the first UPPs installed in Rio were prioritized
as follows: i) the South Zone, a tourist area composed of upper-middle-class neighborhoods; ii)
downtown, with intense commercial activity and services and a high transient population; and iii)
a specific region in the North Zone, called Cinturão da Tijuca, surrounding the Maracanã Stadium,
host to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In November 2010, the northern region, mainly the Complexo
do Alemão and Complexo da Penha, headquarters of the most violent criminal faction (the Red

    Favelas dominated by this faction, which focused on crimes such as drug trafficking, bank rob-
beries, and terrorist activities (BARBASSA, 2015), were disproportionately targeted by the UPP
program. Other criminal organizations such as the “Friends of Friends” and “Third Command” also
lost control over some areas. Magaloni, Franco and Melo (2015) described two reasons that the Red
Command was the main target of the UPP policy: the organization should be weakened since it was
notably violent in its demonstrations of power and many of the favelas located in the South Zone
were under its control. Therefore, the criminals who left the favelas occupied by the UPPs were
largely members of one of the most belligerent of the drug factions.
    Finally, as noted in other studies5 , the UPPs were not randomly assigned to favelas or Police
Districts (PDs), especially in the beginning, when the focus was on the favelas in the richest PDs.
Still, poorer regions in the northern part of the city were eventually treated in subsequent stages.
However, to avoid any problem of selection bias in estimating the causal effect, we account for
population characteristics in each subnormal sector, as described in detail below.


4 Methodology

4.1 Dataset
   To reach the proposed objective, datasets were drawn from two sources: the Institute of Public
Security of Rio de Janeiro (ISP-RJ) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
5
    See, for example, Canavire-Bacarreza et al. (2016) and Verbitsky-Savitz and Raudenbush (2012).


                                                                                       6
The first presents information about different crimes (physical crimes, drug trafficking, property
crimes, etc.) computed monthly by PDs in the State of Rio de Janeiro. To avoid zero inflation
regarding crime occurrences, we chose to present the data in quarterly periods, beginning our analysis
period in the first quarter of 2005 and ending in the last quarter of 2015. In this dataset, it is also
possible to obtain the population of each PD in the analysis period.
    We considered three criminal occurrences (two against people’s lives and one against property)
for each PD: i) intentional homicide; ii) violent lethality6 ; and iii) car theft. These crimes were
chosen because they are generally linked to drug trafficking in Rio de Janeiro, and they have a low
under-reporting rate. In addition, one non-criminal occurrence related to traffic accidents (road
traffic deaths) is used like a placebo to assure the robustness of our identification strategy. It is
expected that this kind of occurrence will not be affected by the UPP policy because it is generally
not directly linked to crime.
    During the analysis period, eight new PDs were created, emerging from the division of other
PDs. Occurrences in these new districts, created in 2005 and onward, were merged with the criminal
and non-criminal occurrences in the original PDs. For this reason, the maps and regression analysis
presented here reflect the number and division of PDs in 2005, before this division.7
    The second dataset used in this research was the 2010 Census, conducted by the Brazilian Ins-
titute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The census provides information about households and
individuals at the precinct level, or the “subnormal sector”.8 This dataset provides information nor-
mally considered in papers analyzing the determinants of criminality9 , including education (adult
literacy adult rate, i.e. for those aged 15 and above), race, percentage of youth population (percent
of people aged 15 to 24), per capita income, and number of residents per household.
    With these two datasets, the control variables used in estimating the impact of UPPs on crime
are described in the Table 1. To construct the variable “percentage of people living in the subnormal
sector of each PD”, as population data was available for smaller subsections of these areas, it was
necessary to aggregate them for each PD using the ArcGIS spatial join tool. Having determined the
total resident population in the subnormal sectors of each PD in 2010, we determined changes in
the population within each PD in each year, using data provided by the ISP-RJ, to determine the
patterns of evolution of similar populations.
    The two other variables concern changes occurring in PDs and in a broader area, called AISP,
in the period. These changes may involve police resources or activity and could have ultimately
impacted crime rates. The dates of these changes were provided by the ISP-RJ and are represented
using dummy variables.

    The following crimes, considered collectively: intentional homicide, bodily injury followed by death, felony murder,
    and homicide resulting from opposition to police intervention.
7
    For example, occurrences observed at PD 130, created on March 6, 2010, were classified within PD 123, since 130
    originated from 123. The same procedure was conducted for PDs 11, 42, 45, 67, 70, 132 and 148, created after
    2005. Crimes computed in these PDs were classified within 15, 16, 22, 65, 71, 126 and 143, respectively.
8
    These are regions, including favelas, that lack essential public services (such as garbage collection, sewage systems,
    water supply networks, electricity, and public lighting).

4.2 Empirical Strategy
    This paper explores the potential breakdown of the “stable value of the treatment unit assumption”
(SUTVA). According to this hypothesis, the treatment to which a unit is exposed does not impact
other non-treated units that are geographically close to the treated units (RUBIN, 1978). Therefore,
this section presents our empirical strategy to identify not only the impact of the UPPs on the PDs
in which they were implemented, but also on the PDs located in the vicinity of the treated regions.

    Delgado and Florax (2015) stated that one of the primary methods used in policy evaluation lite-
rature to identify causal effects when participant selection for a study is not random is the difference-
in-differences (DID) approach. According to Canavire-Bacarreza et al. (2016), this model’s chief
advantage is that it allows the estimation of the impact of an intervention when unobservable factors
are constant over time, or at least during the pre-treatment and post-treatment period. The effect of
the treatment, or policy implemented, is obtained by identifying the difference between two potential
results, where such results are function of the treatment status.
                                                             

                                 yi = Di y 1 + (1 − Di )y 0 =  0                                     (2)
                                                               y se D = 0
where D is characterized as a binary variable indicating the treatment status of an individual, region,
or institution. More specifically, if a unit receives an intervention, the binary variable assumes a value
of 1, and for units not impacted by the program, the variable assumes 0. The variable y is the potential
result of the variable of interest for region i. Equation 3 shows the basic DID model, without the
inclusion of spatial effects, where i = (1, 2, . . . , 130) PDs that were observed in at least two periods
T ∈ {0, 1}. Using this model, the difference in violence rates before and after the installation of
UPPs for treated and untreated PDs was calculated:

                                    yi,t = α + φ + τ + βXi,t + δDi,t + εi,t                           (3)
where yi,t , the dependent variable, is the crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants of PD i at time t. Xi,t
is a vector with independent variables, φ and τ are the fixed effects of PD and time, respectively.


                                                       8
Di,t is a binary variable that takes a value of 1 after the installation of the UPPs for the PDs that
received the UPPs and 0, otherwise. Finally, εi,t is the error term with mean 0.
     To identify the causal impact of an intervention, it is assumed that there are no overlooked
variables that change concurrently with or after the installations of UPPs that directly influence the
occurrence of crime. More specifically, by utilizing PDs and time effects this procedure will control
for: i) observed and unobserved characteristics common to all treated places during a particular
period of time; and ii) observed and unobserved characteristics for every treated territory that are
constant over time.
     However, according to Verbitsky-Savitz and Raudenbush (2012), the SUTVA hypothesis, which
is necessary to ensure consistency within the traditional DID method and to ensure causal iden-
tification, is violated in several areas, including crime, education, and epidemiology. Specifically,
regarding crime, the authors stated that when a crime crackdown program is implemented in one
area, delinquency in that area may be reduced as a result of a spillover of criminal activity to neigh-
boring regions where the program has not been implemented. This hypothesis is formalized as the
“diversion hypothesis” by Dell (2015).
     Even so, some research on this subject have sought to model these potential violations of the
SUTVA hypothesis.10 Usually the authors disregard the possible spillover, diffusion, and displace-
ment effects or only mention that regions neighboring those who received interventions are not good
controls (comparison regions) because they may be affected by these interventions. However, while
this latter group mitigates the problem to some extent, but does not completely circumvent it, since
the net effect of the policy is not obtained. Such issues characterize most studies that have analyzed
the effects of UPP policies on the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. To overcome the identification problem
of the DID method, authors such as Dubé et al. (2014), Delgado and Florax (2015) and Gennaro,
Pellegrini et al. (2016) developed models that considered possible spatial interactions between treated
groups and controls called “spatial difference-in-differences” (SDID) models.

4.2.2 The spatial difference-in-differences model (SDID)

     Even though the traditional difference-in-differences method shown in equation 3 adequately
controls for latent spatial components in time, it omits the presence of spillover and interference
among treated and not treated agents. When considering the possible effects of spillovers, the spatial
difference-in-differences model presents a larger methodological gain, allowing us to decompose the
average treatment effect into both the average direct effect and the average indirect effect (DUBÉ et
al., 2014; BARDAKA; DELGADO; FLORAX, 2018).11 This approach relaxes the SUTVA hypothesis
such that its violation does not preclude the identification of a causal effect, as it would in the
traditional DID model (DELGADO; FLORAX, 2015).
     Thus, as proposed by Delgado and Florax (2015) and drawing on evidence of spillovers caused by
crackdown policies, SDID is applied an extension of the traditional DID method that allows spatial
10
     Cabral (2016) in Brazil and Verbitsky-Savitz and Raudenbush (2012) in the United States are some researchers
     who have sought to model this problem.
11
     A common approach is to identify all treatment and control groups and apply a difference-in-difference-indifference
     method. However, as pointed out byDelgado and Florax (2015), there are disadvantages to using this approach.
     For example, the estimator becomes inefficient in small samples.

interactions. To consider a case where a crime crackdown in one place affects nearby regions, one
must consider not only the treatment status of the PD that received the UPP but also the PDs
nearby. Thus, the term Wi,j Di,t , obtained by applying a spatial lag to the treatment variable, can
be added to equation 3:

                              yi,t = α + φ + τ + βXi,t + δDi,t + ρWi,j Di,t + εi,t                      (4)
    This new term captures the neighborhood relationship between PD i and PD j. In this study,
two types of spatial matrices were tested: a) queen contiguity-based spatial weights: Wi,j assumes a
value of 1 if i is bordered by j and a value of 0, otherwise; and b) nearest k-neighbors: Wi,j assumes a
value of 1 if j is the closest k-neighbor of i and a value of 0, otherwise. Using this new specification, it
is possible to simultaneously estimate two different impacts: the direct causal effects, δ, and indirect
effects, ρ.
    Finally, as discussed by Chagas, Azzoni and Almeida (2016), the indirect effect of treatment, ρ
in equation 4, on treated and untreated units is given in average values. However, the effects in two
different regions can vary significantly. Therefore, as a further analysis proposed by the authors, in
equation 5 we decomposed the effects on treated (WT,T ) and non-treated (WN T,T ) neighbors to verify
if the effect found in the neighbors differs due to treatment status.

                     yi,t = α + φ + τ + βXi,t + δDi,t + ρ1 WT,T Di,t + ρ2 WN T,T Di,t + εi,t            (5)
   This unrestricted model is a special form of the SDID model where WT,N T Di,t and WN T,N T Di,t ,
other elements of the W D matrix decomposition, are suppressed in equation 5 because they are
0-vectors.12


5 Results

5.1 Descriptive Analysis
    To verify the evolution of crime rates in the State of Rio de Janeiro, we considered one crime
against life and one crime against property. More specifically, violent lethality and car theft rates
were analyzed in two years before the beginning of the program, 2005 and 2008, and in three years
after the beginning of UPP activities, 2010, 2012 and 2015. We classified crime rates into five groups,
from the lowest crime rate to the highest: 1) low; 2) medium-low; 3) medium; 4) medium-high, and;
5) high.
    Figure 3 shows that before the implementation of UPPs, only a few PDs presented criminality
rates considered “high” or “medium-high” when considering crimes against life in Rio de Janeiro State.
The more violent PDs, represented by brown spots, were located near the city of Rio de Janeiro (the
area enclosed within the black border) and in the coastal region of Búzios. In general, however, little
difference existed among the lethality rates in PDs in Rio de Janeiro State in the periods prior to
UPPs’ installation in 2008.

Note – The Jenks natural breaks method was used to classify each PD in each year into a group, as violent lethality
       rates varied throughout each year. The average upper-limit rate of the “low” group was 15.93 homicides per
       100,000 inhabitants, whereas “medium-low” was 33.82, “medium” was 59.99, “medium-high” was 125.87, and
       “high” was 363.38.


    In 2010, two years after the first implementation and occupation of UPPs in the capital, a greater
concentration of PDs are marked with darker colors, mainly around the state capital, indicating an
intensification of crimes against life in this region compared to others. In 2012 and 2015, when the
UPPs implementation had reached an advanced stage, the figures show even greater differences than
between 2005 and 2008. In 2015, 16 out of 130 PDs, particularly those near the state capital and on
the coast, began to present lethality rates considered “high” when compared with the rates of other

PDs in the state. This may indicate the proliferation and migration of violence to various regions of
the state, especially those regions close to the capital.
    Figure 4, which presents property crimes, specifically car theft rates, contributes to a better
understanding of violence migration, as this type of crime was once concentrated in the capital
area. In 2005, only PDs in the capital were classified as having “medium-high” or “high” car theft
rates. However, this type of occurrence spread after the implementation of the UPP program. Other
regions, mainly the Baixada Fluminense and Niterói, presented concentrations of PDs with high car
theft rates in 2010, 2012, and particularly 2015.

    The new pattern observed in the state may be related to the installation of UPPs, which may
have reduced the violence rates in PDs which received them, especially in the state capital, but
contributed to the movement of violence into other regions, increasing the heterogeneity of violence
in the state. This will be the topic of the next subsection of this article.

5.2 UPP Effects
    Tables 2 and 3 present the results of both the traditional difference-in-differences (DID) model
and the spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) model. Two specifications for each methodology are
presented. In columns 1 and 3, there are no control variables. In columns 2 and 4, the control
variables explained in Table 1 are included. We also controlled for time effects and PD fixed effects
in both specifications. In Table 2, we consider the UPPs’ implementation date as the beginning of
the policy. Furthermore, only the coefficients of interest, δ for traditional DID, and ρ for spatial DID,
are displayed in each regression. Comparing the DID and SDID models, it is notable that the UPP
policy decreased crime in the areas that receive the units and increased crime in neighboring areas.

   For example, in the last column of Table 2, our results show that the effect of the program on
homicide rates in the analyzed region would be reduced by 19.08 homicides per 100,000 people in
a region that presented 41 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2007, a year prior to UPP imple-
mentation. However, this reduction was accompanied by a statistically significant increase of 7.84
homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in the region’s immediate neighbors, when controls are considered.

This effect was also observed regarding property crimes. Car thefts were reduced by 116.95 occur-
rences per 100,000 inhabitants in the PDs that received UPPs but increased by 65.43 in neighboring
areas. Therefore, despite generally reducing crime, the UPP policy seems to exercise an opposite
effect in PDs neighboring those in which UPPs were installed. This phenomenon was valid both for
crimes against life and property crimes.
    Furthermore, as expected, traffic accident deaths were not statistically affected by UPP policies
in PDs that received them or in their neighbors. As already mentioned, this type of occurrence is
not linked to drug trafficking activity in Rio de Janeiro. Considering that the UPPs installation
date typically occurred after an occupation by police forces, the effects of the UPP program can be
perceived even before the units’ installation. To test this “pre-installation effect”, a second analysis is
presented in Table 3, which considers the program to have started on the occupation date provided
by the ISP-RJ.

we consider only the traditional DID method. The net effect of the UPP policy on intentional
homicide rates in the State of Rio de Janeiro would be an approximate reduction of 5 homicides per
100,000 inhabitants rather than around 11, as found in the first traditional DID formulation. Further,
specifically regarding property crimes, a greater increase in neighboring regions’ crime rates can be
attributed to the UPPs’ occupation than the reduction noticed in the locations that received the
UPPs. A possible reason for this beyond proportional increase in crime within neighboring regions
may involve changes in the activity of criminals coming from the PDs occupied by the UPPs. To
maintain the profits previously obtained through drug trafficking, these criminals, who initially lack
control of territories and thus cannot control drug traffic, might focus on property crimes in these
neighborhoods.
    Again, even considering the date of occupation as the beginning of the policy, there were no
statistically significant results for occurrences not related to drug trafficking, such as deaths caused
by traffic accidents. The results found in this section corroborate the study’s hypothesis that at
least part of the reduced violence in the areas addressed by the UPP policy may actually reflect the
movement of criminals to neighboring regions. It is important to verify, however, the crime spillover
pattern. This objective requires a deeper analysis and is developed below.


5.3 Spillover to Treated and Non-treated Neighbors
    Using Chagas, Azzoni and Almeida (2016) approach, we tested if the statistically significant
indirect effect found in the previous analysis differed between non-treated and treated PDs. That is,
we investigated if the migration of criminals to other areas differed if these other areas had UPPs.
Drawing on Becker (1968), it is expected that after a UPP program began, criminals would not
migrate to other regions with UPPs since these regions were already intensely policed, especially in
the favelas. This analysis will again compare the installation and occupation dates.
    In the Table 4, first we find that the policy’s indirect effect of increasing crime in neighboring
PDs is largely confined those PDs that never received the intervention, represented as WNT. The
indirect effects on the treated neighbors, WTT, were not statistically significant for any kind of
crime, indicating that if criminals migrated, they chose to target places without UPPs. This finding
was valid when considering both the installation date and the occupation date, demonstrating the
robustness of the results.
    Secondly, when we consider the magnitude of the coefficients, changing the start dates of the
policy yields different results. Regarding the installation date, the UPP policy still had the net effect
of reducing both crimes against life and property in the State of Rio de Janeiro during the analysis
period. If the occupation date was considered in the investigation of the policy’s effect on crimes
against life, the policy’s indirect effect on untreated PDs slightly exceeded the direct effect of the
policy on the treated PDs. This effect of the policy becomes even more negative when property
crimes are analyzed, as seen in car theft rates. Even though the final net effect was not robust, our
results clearly imply that measuring the impact of the UPPs using traditional DID methodology will
overestimate effects. It seems clear that the policy had some adverse effects, mainly in neighboring
regions not served by UPPs. This indirect effect could be of the same magnitude, but in the reverse

    Finally, Figure 5 presents the observed change in average rates of crimes against life from baseline
rates observed in the first quarter of 2007, prior to the UPP policy. Coefficients are estimated in
the second column (date of installation with controls) of Table 4 for both PDs that received UPPs
and PDs neighboring these areas. For example, the average intentional homicide rate in the areas
surrounding PDs that would be given UPPs in the first quarter of 2007 was 48.42 homicides per
100,000 inhabitants. With an average estimated increase of 10.25 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants

Note – We utilized average crime rates in the first quarter of 2007 as a baseline. We considered those PDs bordering
       PDs with UPPs to be “neighboring PDs” (queen contiguity).


    On the other hand, it is possible to verify a 43.01% reduction in the average intentional homicide
rates (from 38.78 to 22.10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants) and a 38.68% reduction in the average
rates of violent lethality (from 56.84 to 34.85 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) in PDs that received the
UPPs. Therefore, this result indicates that the UPP policy has resulted in greater crime disparities
between regions of Rio de Janeiro, leading to higher crime rates in regions that were, on average,
more violent before UPP implementation.


6 Concluding Remarks
    This paper aimed to verify possible crime spillover to regions neighboring those that received
UPPs in Rio de Janeiro City. To meet this goal, datasets from the ISP-RJ and IBGE containing
criminal and population information from 2005 to 2015 were utilized. We employed difference-in-
differences methodological approach and its spatial variation, spatial difference-in-differences. Thus,
we were not only able to ascertain the direct effects of the UPP policy on PDs in which it was
implemented, but also its indirect effects on neighboring PDs, particularly those in which UPPs were
not implemented.
    Three different categories of crime were investigated. Two were related to crimes against life
and one to property crimes. It was observed that failing to account for the UPP policy’s effect on
neighboring areas leads to an overestimation of the general impact of the UPP policy in Rio de

Janeiro State. We verified that murder rates, for example, significantly decreased in the PDs that
received UPPs. However, this decrease was followed, also significantly, by increased murder rates
in these regions’ immediate neighbors. In some models, the effect of increased crime in neighboring
regions surpassed that of the decreased crime rates in PDs that received UPPs.
    The literature suggests these results are due to the spillover caused by these kinds of crime
crackdown policies. In other words, criminals affected by the policy could migrate to nearby regions
that lacked a UPP presence where the cost of crime remained constant. In those locales, criminals
would fight for new territories and/or undertake new criminal practices to maintain profits, which
could increase crime rates and individuals’ safety concerns.
    It is clear that the UPP policy did not considered these possible spillovers to neighboring regions.
Its focus was to reduce criminal rates in the capital, mainly in the places where would receive a
great number of tourists from the international sports events, through the expulsion of criminals
from their areas of origin. Therefore, as other regions that received them were less prepared for the
fight against these organized gangs, they were significantly and negatively affected by this policy.
The policy implication of this paper shows that the short-term effect of the UPP program was lower
than observed by the recent literature. Even worst, in some cases the effect could be reversed than
expected.
    Finally, a possible limitation of this paper stems from its dataset. Socioeconomic factors were not
controlled for in our estimates, as this type of information was not available on an annual basis for
each PD. Although we control the fixed effects of time and PD, these characteristics may vary over
time and within each PD, affecting the violence rates in Rio de Janeiro State and the results of the
estimates obtained in this paper. Further research may seek to correct this limitation and, moreover,
to estimate medium-term and long-term effects of the policy not only on the regions in which it was
implemented but also on neighboring PDs. This could promote an understanding of whether this
costly policy has served to improve the well-being of the population of the State of Rio de Janeiro,
particularly in the metropolitan region surrounding the capital.
