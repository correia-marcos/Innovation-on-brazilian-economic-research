 This study investigates how the fiscal credibility affects the inflation rate in an emerging
 economy under inflation target. Based on the Brazilian experience, a fiscal credibility index is
 built taking into account how the market expectations are anchored to the primary surplus
 target. The main idea is that a government that is able to anchor expectations around the target
 (case of high credibility) may reduce inflation. The findings provide empirical evidence that
 the success of government in achieving the fiscal primary surplus target (gain of credibility) is
 an important ally to reduce inflation rate and its expectations.
 Key words: fiscal credibility, inflation, primary surplus, inflation targeting.

 Este estudo investiga como a credibilidade fiscal afeta a taxa de inflação em uma economia
 emergente sob o regime de metas de inflação. Com base na experiência brasileira, um índice
 de credibilidade fiscal é construído levando-se em conta como as expectativas de mercado são
 ancoradas à meta de superávit primário. A ideia principal é a de que um governo capaz de
 ancorar as expectativas em torno da meta (caso de alta credibilidade) pode reduzir a inflação.
 Os resultados evidenciam que o sucesso do governo em produzir a meta de superávit primário
 (ganho de credibilidade) é um importante aliado para reduzir tanto a taxa quanto as
 expectativas de inflação

1. Introduction

       A sound fiscal position is essential to any economy. Since the 1990s the growing
concern with inflation has brought several countries to adopt inflation targeting. There exist
several studies which indicate that the use of this monetary framework represents a success in
the control of inflation (e.g. Lin and Ye, 2009; and de Mendonça and de Guimarães e Souza,
2012). However, one of the preconditions to the success of inflation targeting is the fiscal
balance. It is well-known that in the case where the government is not committed to fiscal
balance, the result is a pressure on inflation due to the risk of expansionary monetary policy
and to finance public debts. In brief, there exists a relationship between government fiscal
commitment and inflation.
       An important issue in the analysis regarding inflation targeting is credibility because it
plays an essential role in the commitment of reaching low and stable inflation. Although a
great part of the literature pays attention only to the credibility of the monetary authority, this
is only one side of the coin. Following the literature that builds on Sargent e Wallace (1981),
unsustainable fiscal police may lead the monetary authority to monetize fiscal deficits and
thus wreck credibility. Based on a different view, scholars from fiscal theory of price level
(e.g. Woodford, 2001; and Sims, 1994) argue that the control of money supply is not a
sufficient condition to stabilize inflation. In brief, the government solvency is essential to
monetary policy being able to control inflation.
       This study investigates how the fiscal credibility affects the inflation rate in an
emerging economy under inflation target. The analysis on the Brazilian case after adoption of
inflation targeting is useful, as with Chile and Poland, this country announces the inflation
target jointly by the government and central bank in order to make the government commit to
the fiscal discipline needed to achieve the target. Moreover, Brazil has had explicit fiscal
primary surplus targets since 2000, and expectations of variables (e.g. inflation rate and
primary surplus) are available from the Time Series Management System - Central Bank of
Brazil (TSMS/CBB). The main idea is that a government that is able to anchor expectations
around the target (case of high credibility) may reduce inflation. The results in this study
provide empirical evidence that the success of government in achieving the fiscal primary
surplus target (gain of credibility) contributes to the reduction of inflation.
       Few studies analyze the impact of fiscal credibility on inflation rate in emerging
economies. For an analysis of the pass-through on inflation for the Brazilian economy, de
Mendonça and Tostes (2015), taking into account the fiscal credibility index built by de
                                                 2
Mendonça and Machado (2013), found that fiscal credibility is an important tool for reducing
inflation. Kuncoro (2015) in an analysis regarding Indonesia concluded that fiscal credibility
is important for price stabilization in the inflation targeting framework.
        This study differs from these above-mentioned in several dimensions. It is important
to highlight that the indicator of fiscal credibility in de Mendonça and Machado (2013) is
based on the deviations of the market expectations on public debt-to-GDP in relation to the
prudential benchmark suggested by International Monetary Fund. Moreover, the index used
by Kuncoro (2015) quantifies the fiscal rules credibility measure using the deviation of actual
budget from the projected one. In a different manner, the fiscal credibility index in this study
takes into account how the market expectations are anchored to the primary surplus target.
Therefore, we consider a true fiscal commitment announced previously by the government.
This procedure is in agreement with the well-known definition of credibility made by
Cukierman and Meltzer (1986), which can be understood as the difference between the
policymaker’s plans and the public’s beliefs about those plans. Furthermore, we provide
empirical evidence regarding the effect of fiscal credibility on inflation rate, inflation of
market prices, inflation of administered prices, and inflation expectations, based on the
structural model adopted by Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) through Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) regressions. Furthermore, a vector
autoregression model (VAR) is also performed for the period January 2003 to December
2015.
        The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 makes a presentation of
the measurement of the fiscal credibility in Brazil for the period from 2003 to 2015. Section 3
presents the data and methodology used in this study. Section 4 provides empirical evidence,
through an econometric analysis, of the effect of the fiscal credibility on inflation. Section 5
concludes the paper.

2. Measuring fiscal credibility in Brazil

        It is a challenge to summarize the government’s ability in guiding the expectation
process of the economic agents through only one measurement (fiscal credibility index). It
involves multiple dimensions such as: the intertemporal nature of fiscal sustainability; the
empirical limits for the public debt-to-GDP growth ratio; the risk perception about possible
fiscal dominance scenarios; the institutional setting and accountability of fiscal policy; and the
effects of political and electoral cycles on fiscal authorities. In this context, we build an index

                                                3
which starts from two criteria: (i) because the index under construction is a limited variable,
instead of using variables like debt-to-GDP ratio (see, de Mendonça and Machado, 2013),
which usually follow a non-stationary stochastic process, stationary fiscal flow measurement
is used; and (ii) the use of a reference for exogenous expectation guidance based on a very
well defined lower bound for the fiscal flow variable which is publicly preannounced for the
next year.
        The one-step-ahead expectations of fiscal primary surplus are the natural candidate for
being the main information for a fiscal credibility index because the fiscal primary surplus is
the adjustment component in the nominal deficit that could ensure the fulfillment of the
intertemporal budget restriction. In addition, the expectations of fiscal primary surplus are
measured as a ratio-to-GDP (usually a stationary process) and represent the median of
financial market institutions expectations for the next year for the fiscal primary surplus. This
information is extracted from a daily survey of market expectations conducted by Central
Bank of Brazil (CBB) for the evolution of the main Brazilian macroeconomic variables
(Focus Market Readout).
        It is important to highlight that since the promulgation of the Fiscal Responsibility
Law in 2000 the government has to define annual goals for fiscal variables for execution in
current year and the next two years, publicly announced as an Annex of Budget Guidelines
Law (Lei de Diretrizes Orçamentárias – LDO) by September of the previous year. In other
words, this information represents a benchmark for macroeconomic forecasts, and thus, the
goals for fiscal primary surplus (FPS*) are the essence of the fiscal credibility index in order
to evaluate the performance and ability of the government to anchor expectations. Table 1
shows these goals and their respective laws.2
        It is a fact that expectations deteriorate faster as the fiscal primary surplus is lower
than the target. Hence, the use of different intervals creates an asymmetrical framework which
is useful in the measurement of credibility. In this context, two intervals are considered in the
index: (i) an ideal interval which corresponds to a very good performance of the government
regarding       the      primary        surplus       in      reaching       the      target,      that      is,

  Some fiscal surplus goals were revised within the current year. Those revisions were not considered because
they do not affect the expectations formed during the previous year.

essential for building the credibility index, is presented in figure 1.3 In general, it is possible
to identify two phases. The first, before the subprime crisis (2007), inflation expectations are
inside the tolerance interval and near the primary surplus target practically all the time. The
second represents a deterioration of the expectations and they exceed the lower bound of the
tolerance interval most of the time.

           Figure 2 shows the performance of fiscal credibility from 2003 to 2015 in Brazil. A
clear trend of worsening over time is observed. In large measure, the subprime crisis implied a
change of the fiscal stance in the Brazilian economy. As pointed out by CBB, the
intensification of the effects of the international financial crisis on the internal expectations
prompted the government to adopt expansionist fiscal measures. As a consequence, “in
December 2008 tax cuts were introduced which favored the credit market conditions and
propitiated expansion of consumers’ available income. In this sense, noteworthy is the
adjustment of the progressive income tax table to the growth of nominal wages of the
economy; the reductions of IPI rates levied on the purchase of new vehicles and trucks, and of
the Financial Operations Tax (IOF) levied on loans granted to individuals; the creation of two
intermediate rates, of 7.5% and 22.5%, of the table of the Individual Income Tax (IRPF),

3. Data and methodology

           In order to observe the possible impact of the fiscal credibility on inflation rate, the
period under analysis is from January 2003 to December 2015 (156 observations – monthly
frequency). This analysis starts in January 2003 because this is when the Brazilian economy
eliminated the negative effects caused by the confidence crises due to the election of President
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and when, for example, new information started being released by
CBB such as Brazilian Economic Activity Index (IBC-Br).
           The official price index that is used to measure inflation rate in Brazil is the National
Consumer Price Index (extended) – IPCA. In general, prices are a result of market prices
(prices resultant of market force) and administered prices (prices defined by contracts and
prices that are monitored, depending on government authorization).4 Administered prices are
divided into tax, public utility services, and petroleum derivatives, which in turn, are slightly
sensitive to the market forces. Moreover, inflation expectations are an essential component to
be analyzed under inflation targeting system.

         With the intention of observing the relation between the fiscal credibility and inflation
rate in the Brazilian economy, the first empirical procedure is straightforward. We present
four scatterplots and correlations for fiscal credibility (FCRED) and its relation with: full
inflation rate (INF), inflation of market prices (INFM), inflation of administered prices (INFA),
and inflation expectations (E(INF)) respectively (see figure 4). With exception for the case of
administered prices, there exists a negative correlation (around -0.3) to other cases, which in
turn, suggests that fiscal credibility may reduce inflation rate and reinforces the causal
hypothesis to be tested econometrically.
         A simple manner of observing how fiscal credibility can affect inflation under
inflation targeting is through a Phillips curve. Because credibility is a forward-looking
concept (see de Mendonça and de Guimarães e Souza, 2009) and taking as reference the
version of the Phillips curve used in the structural model adopted by CBB when inflation
targeting was adopted in June of 1999 (see Bogdanski, Tombini, and Werlang, 2000), the
following equation is considered:5

         In order to see the effect of fiscal credibility on inflation of market prices, inflation of
administered prices, and inflation expectations, equation (2) is rewritten in the following way:
(3)     INFMt  6  7 INFMt1  8 Et ( INFt 12 )  9 GAPt  10 WPI  EX t  11FCREDt   t0 ,

(5)     Et ( INFt 12 )  18  19 INFt 1  20GAPt  21 WPI  EX t  22 FCREDt   t2 ,

where:
INFM t - is the inflation measured by IPCA - non monitored prices; and INFAt - is the inflation
measured by IPCA - supervised prices – total.
         In this framework, the impact of the variable FCRED on inflation rate is
straightforward. From the theoretical view it is expected that the results indicate a negative
and significant coefficient on FCRED (5,11,17,22<0). The negative impact of the
credibility on inflation is in consonance with the view that a greater commitment with the
fiscal goals increases the power of the central bank to achieve the target and thus to anchor
inflation expectations.
         In general, the use of time series data in estimations needs to analyze whether the
series in the model have a unit root (non-stationary data series) to avoid the possibility of
spurious regression. Hence, the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP), and
Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests are performed. The results indicate that all
series are I(0) (see table A.3 – appendix).6
         In order to estimate the equations (2), (3), (4), and (5), this study uses two methods:
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). These methods
are useful to observe the impact caused by the fiscal credibility on inflation rate (and its
variations) through a direct observation of the estimated parameters.
         In general, macroeconomic time series models are subject to the problem of
endogeneity. Moreover, the fact that the series have monthly frequency may still have issues
of heteroscedasticity in the regressions. Hence, OLS method cannot performs well under these
issues. Therefore, in order to deal with these problems the GMM is used. A condition for
efficient estimation based on GMM is that overriding restrictions need to be respected
(Woodridge, 2001). In this context, all regressions present the J-statistic as a test for over-

 The main criticisms of those tests are their lack of power (low probability of rejection when the null is false), as
our general results were rejection over non-stationarity we considered unnecessary to perform other tests.
Moreover, our fiscal credibility index is not tested for nonstationarity because it is a limited variable by
construction.

GMM regressions are the lagged regressors.7
        In order to observe the relevance of the credibility effect on inflation (full IPCA),
inflation of market prices, inflation of administered prices, and inflation expectations over
time, this study besides the OLS and GMM models provides empirical evidence through
Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models. 8 In general, the analysis of VAR is made through
impulse response functions because it allows one to see the impulse of fiscal credibility on
inflation rate and inflation expectations caused by shocks (or innovations) provoked by
residual variables over time. As suggested by Koop, Pesaran, and Potter (1996) and Pesaran
and Shin (1998), this study makes use of the generalized impulse response function (impulse
responses are invariant to any re-ordering of the variables in the VAR) because it provides
more robust results than the orthogonalized method.


4. Empirical evidence

        This section presents some empirical evidence on the impact of the fiscal credibility
on inflation (full IPCA), inflation of market prices, inflation of administered prices, and
inflation expectations in the Brazilian economy. The analysis is divided into three steps. In the
first step we present OLS estimations. The second step presents GMM estimations. Finally, in
the third step, we observe the response of the inflation rate and its variations to a shock
transmitted by the fiscal credibility through impulse-response analysis.
        The coefficients for the OLS estimations are in consonance with the theoretical
perspective (see table 2). The negative and significant coefficients on fiscal credibility
observed for the regressions on inflation (full IPCA), inflation of market prices, and inflation
expectations are in line with the first impression from the correlation observed in figure 5.
This observation is a clear indication that the government commitment with the fiscal primary
surplus target (high credibility) is an important mechanism to reduce inflation rate. This result
comes as no surprise because one of the main pillars for the success of inflation targeting is
the sustained fiscal balance. In this context, a breach of the Brazilian government with the
fiscal surplus (low credibility) target denotes a lack of the commitment to ensure an

  In order to eliminate skewing the results, the maximum of lags applied for each instrument was 9. In addition,
the number of instruments in all models is less than 14% in relation to the total of observations) – the
instruments are listed in the appendix (see table A.4).

  Based on Schwarz (SIC), Akaike (AIC), and Hannan-Quinn (HQ) criteria, the VAR order is 2 (see table A.5).
Furthermore, VARs satisfy the stability condition (see figure A.1 – appendix).

environment that supports the reaching of the inflation target. The non-significance for fiscal
credibility in the explanation of inflation of administered prices can be a consequence that
prices are defined by contracts and thus are less subject to the success of the government in
the achievement of the targets.
       Besides the coefficients on fiscal credibility, the coefficients on the other variables for
the explanation of the dependent variables shown in table 2 are in line with the theoretical
view. The positive and significant coefficient on inflation expectations in most models is
coherent with the argument that the forward-looking behavior of economic agents is crucial
for the success of inflation targeting. The negative and significant coefficient on the output
gap in most models regarding inflation (INF, INFM, and INFA) reflects the fact that Brazil has
experienced a low and negative growth rate in a large part of the period under analysis.
Although the coefficient on the variable that captures the effect on the external shocks
transmitted to inflation is positive in most of models, the non-significance is a result that the
exchange rate was overvalued most of the time.

       Extending the analysis regarding the impact of the fiscal credibility on inflation rate,
inflation of market prices, inflation of administered prices, and inflation expectations, the
previous results from OLS and GMM models are confirmed through the generalized impulse-
response functions plotted out to the 36th month. Figure 5 suggests that an unexpected
positive shock on fiscal credibility provokes a significant decrease in inflation rate, inflation
of market prices, and inflation expectations. We can see that the negative effect on inflation
due to a shock transmitted through fiscal credibility takes around 9 months to become
significant and remains significant for about 6 months. A similar effect is valid for the case of
                                                   13
inflation of market prices. An unexpected positive shock on fiscal credibility provokes a
significant decrease in inflation of market prices after 6 months and abides significant for 6
more months. In the same vein, a shock transmitted by fiscal credibility also provokes a
negative impact on inflation expectations. However, the statistical significance of this effect is
considerably greater than that observed for the previous cases. Finally, such as presented in
the OLS and GMM estimations, the effect of fiscal credibility on inflation of administered
prices is not observed.

contribution in this study was the elaboration of a fiscal credibility index based on how the
market expectations are anchored to the primary surplus target. The findings suggest that the
success of government in achieving the fiscal primary surplus target (gain of credibility) is an
important ally to reduce inflation rate and its expectations.
