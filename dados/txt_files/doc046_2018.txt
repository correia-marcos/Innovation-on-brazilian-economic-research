1     Introduction
    Economic agents decide based on a global view of how the economy behaves at that moment. The general level
of output, employment, interest rates, exchange rates and ination are examples of important economic indicators
that help in the country's diagnosis. One of the most comprehensive and important macroeconomic indicators of
the economy is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as it is a proxy for a country's economic performance.                   In
the present work, the proxy used for GDP is industrial production, since the indicator of industrial production is
monthly (higher frequency than GDP) and is released with a lag of about one month, which is therefore smaller
than GDP (with a delay of more than two months).             Therefore, the proposition and evaluation of econometric
models of forecasting are relevant and bring benets to build better forecasts to enable more accurate expectations
of economic agents.
    A point to address is if the use of disaggregated data helps in forecasting variables. Data disaggregation is an
alternative to lead to more accurate forecasts. This alternative refers to the decomposition of the main variable into
several subcomponents, which have dierent weights for the aggregate series. These subcomponents are estimated
individually and then grouped to obtain a forecast of the aggregate series. This technique can increase the quality
of the forecast because we model the subcomponents taking into account their individual characteristics. We use
this alternative in the present work to understand if there are gains to predict the aggregate series if we estimate
each subcomponent and we use the weight of this subcomponent.
    The accuracy of this alternative for forecasting has been discussed in some studies.           The theoretical studies
indicate that when the data generating process (DGP) is known, it is preferable to rst use the data disaggregated
in multiple series to later aggregate them, than to directly predict the already aggregated series. However, the author
acknowledges that in most cases DGP is unknown and therefore the use of aggregate series may be preferable due to
variability of specication and estimation of the model. Some examples of contributions to the theoretical literature
on aggregate or disaggregate forecasting are Lutkepohl (1984, 1987), Granger (1987), Pesaran, Pierse, and Kumar
(1989), Garderen, Lee, and Pesaran (2000), and Giacomini and Granger (2004). As DGP is not known, then the
question (if aggregating the disaggregated forecasts improves the accuracy of the aggregate forecast) becomes an
empirical question.
    Our point is whether the prediction of the disaggregated components of Brazilian industrial production improves
the accuracy of the forecast of aggregate Brazilian industrial production. Our contribution is that we do not know
articles that address the contribution of the disaggregated data of the weighted lag adaptative least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (WLadaLASSO) methodology or the exponential smoothing (selecting the most
appropriate model).     In addition, there are few papers that analyze the contribution of disaggregated data to
industrial production and we intend to ll this gap.       From monthly data from 2002 to 2017, we select the best
unviariate model, estimate a rolling window of 100 xed observations and we evaluate the forecast from 1 to 12
months ahead for Brazilian industrial production, in which we estimate 61 rolling windows. We consider as naive
models the rst order autoregressive model (AR(1)), AR(1) with time-varying parameters (TVP AR(1)), the Stock
and Watson (2007) unobserved components with stochastic volatility (UC-SV), estimated based on Kroese and
Chan (2014).   We consider the following methods for selecting the best model: exponential smoothing based on

Hyndman et al (2002), Hyndman and Khandakar (2008) and Hyndman et al (2008), the least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator (LASSO), adaptive LASSO (adaLASSO), and the WLadaLASSO. We use the LASSO and its
variants to select the lags from an AR (15). We compare the prediction performance between the models based on
the mean square error (MSE) and the Diebold and Mariano (1995) test. Our results point to a better performance
of the exponential smoothing model with disaggregated data for the forecast of 1 to 7 months ahead for Brazilian
industrial production by MSE. But WLadaLASSO disaggregated forecasts with more accuracy for 8 to 12 months
ahead by MSE. To analyze whether there is a better statistical performance, we use the exponential model with
disaggregated data a benchmark with the Diebold and Mariano (1995) test. We can consider that the disaggregated
exponential smoothing model presents better statistical performance for prediction in relation to the naive models
(AR(1), AR(1) with time-varying parameters, UC-SV) considered with aggregate or disaggregated data and the
aggregate exponential smoothing model.
    The article structure contains six sections in addition to this introduction. The following is a brief review of
the literature. Next, we address the methodology of the models considered in the paper. Section 4 presents the
data used, the empirical forecasting strategy and the Diebold and Mariano (1995) test to compare the performance
of the models. In section 5, we discuss the results of the study. Finally, we show the nal considerations of the
research and the next steps.



2     Literature Review
    The present section address some empirical articles that address the dierence in forecast accuracy between
aggregating the disaggregated forecasts or modeling only the aggregate variable.
    Stock and Watson (1998) compare 49 univariate projection models to forecast industrial activity and ination
in the United States from 215 monthly series from the years 1959 to 1996.       One conclusion of the paper is the
nding that the aggregation of forecasts exceeded the performance of separate forecasts.      The authors also nd
that gains from the use of forecast combinations are signicant enough to justify their use by a risk-averse analyst.
The authors also point to the importance of performing the unit root test to reduce errors substantially in the
estimates. Tobias and Zellner (1998) seek to determine the eects of aggregation and disaggregation to predict the
average annual growth rate of 18 countries. In general, the disaggregation leads to more observations to estimate
the parameters, besides the authors obtain better predictions for the aggregate variable (growth rate).
    Marcellino, Stock and Watson (2003) nd evidence that the individual estimation of ination in each euro area
country and the subsequent aggregation of projections increases the accuracy of the nal result of the estimation,
in relation to the option to predict this variable only in aggregate level. Hubrich (2005) obtains that aggregating
forecasts by component of ination does not necessarily better predict year-on-year ination in the euro area one
year ahead.. Espasa, Senra and Albacete (2002) have similar results indicating, however, that the disaggregation
leads to better projections for periods longer than one month. Carlos and Marçal (2016) compare the prediction
from models for aggregate ination and aggregating the forecasts for the groups and items of the Brazilian ination
index. The authors obtain that there are gains in the accuracy of the forecast with disaggregated data.
    Barhoumi et al (2010) analyze the forecasting performance of the France GDP between alternative factor models.
The point of the work is whether it is more appropriate to extract data factors with aggregates or disaggregated
to predict.   Rather than using 140 disaggregated series, Barhoumi et al (2010) show that the static approach of
Stock and Watson (2002) with 20 aggregate series leads to better prediction results. The next section presents the
methodology we use in this paper.



3     Methodology
    We consider three naive estimators to compare our model forecasts: UC with stochastic volatility, autoregressive
model and time-varying parameters autoregressive. Our point is select the lag variables that are relevant based on
dierent univariate methodologies. We use LASSO and two variants (LASSO, ADALASSO and WLADALASSO)
and exponential smoothing method with ETS.

parameters. This model serves as a naive predictive alternative and therefore we use only one lag. The methodology

3.2 UC with stochastic volatilty

where      lnσt     is the log stochastic volatility,                     βt    is the trend,           lnσt = lnσt−1 + e1t ,     and   lnωt = lnωt−1 + e2t ,   in which
the variances of               e1t   and   e2t   are respectively               g1   and    g2 .    We estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm with Gibbs sampling method following Barnett et al (2014).
   Our rst step is to establish the priors and starting values. We dene the prior for the initial value of the lnσt
aslnσ0 ∼ N (µ0 , 10) where µ0 is the variance of yt0 − βt0 and t0 refers to the training sample of 40 observations
and βt0 is an initial estimate for the trend from the HodrickPrescott lter. In a similar way, lnω0 ∼ N (ω0 , 10)
where ω0 = ∆βt0 . We use the priors for g1 and g2 from an inverse gamma, we set the prior scale parameter equal
to 0.01 and 0.0001 respectively with one degree of freedom as Barnett et al (2014).
     So the next step is to simulate the posterior distributions.                                                 We draw   σt   and   ωt conditional on the value for
g1   and   g2   with the Metropolis algorithm based on Jacquier et al (2004). We draw                                                   βt using the Carter and Kohn
(2004) algorithm. We generate the sample for                                     g1      and   g2   from the inverse gamma distribution. We consider 10,000
replications of the MCMC algorithm and we keep with the last 1,000 replications for inference.
     Below we detail how we calculate the marginal likelihood. We use a particle lter to calculate the log likelihood
function for the UC-SV. We dene                             Ξ   as all parameters of the model. Based on Chib (1995), we consider the log
marginal likelihood as:

evaluate the prior density easily. But to get the term                  lnG Ξ̂|yt ,           we need an additional step.             lnG Ξ̂|yt            can be

factorized into conditional and marginal densities of various parameter blocks and we use Gibbs and Metropolis
algorithm to approximate these densities according to Chib (1995) and Chib and Jeliazkov (2001). The posterior

density is dened as        G Ξ̂|yt = G (ĝ1 , ĝ2 )          and we drop the dependence on                   yt   to simplify the notation.                 The

factorization of this density can be described by

                                                  G (ĝ1 , ĝ2 ) = H (ĝ1 |ĝ2 ) H (ĝ2 )                               (16)

where H (ĝ1 |ĝ2 ) = H (ĝ1 |ĝ2 , Θ) H (Θ|ĝ2 ) dΘ and H (ĝ2 ) = H (ĝ2 |Θ) H (Θ) dΘ, in which Θ = {βt , σt , ωt } is the
state variables in the model. These two densities H (ĝ1 |ĝ2 ) and H (ĝ2 ) can be obtained as a 'weighted average'
across state variables. We can approximate H (ĝ1 |ĝ2 ) and H (ĝ2 ) with additional Gibbs runs and we can integrate
over the states. We consider 10,000 iterations in these additional Gibbs samplers and we remain with the last 3,000
like Barnett et al (2014).

where   λ≥0     is a tunning parameter and lasso requires a method to obtain a value for                                   λ,   that we explain soon.
                                                                                                                                k

The rst term is the sum of square of residuals and the second term is a shrinkage penalty.                                           |βj |   is the   `1   norm
                                                                                                                                j=1
of a coecient vector  β . The `1 penalty forces some of the coecients estimates to be equal to                                              zero when       λ   is
suciently large.   When λ = 0, LASSO estimates are equal to ordinary least squares estimates. So,                                            lasso technique
performs variable selection.
   Cross-validation is usually the method to obtain the                          λ   value.    With time series data, we use the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) to choose              λ,   following Konzen and Ziegelmman (2016). We consider a grid of                                  λ   values.


3.3.2    Adalasso


   Zou (2006) states that with LASSO we can obtain an inconsistent selection of variables that keep noisy variables
for example for a given      λ      that leads to optimal estimation rate. Also the author shows that LASSO can lead to the
right selection of variables with biased estimates for large coecients and this take to suboptimal prediction rates.
   So, Zou (2006) introduces the adaptive LASSO, which considers weights                               ωj   that adjust the penalty to be dierent
for each coecient. The adaptive LASSO seeks to minimize

where   ωj =| β̂jridge |   −τ
                                ,   τ > 0.   The adaptive LASSO considers that large (small) coecients have small (large)
weights - and small (large) penalties. The coecients estimated by ridge regression lead to get the weight                                         ωj .     Ridge
regression shrinks the vector of coecients by penalizing the sum of the squares of the residuals:

3.3.3   WLadalasso


   In case we consider adalasso with time series data, each coecient associated with a lagged variable is penalized
according to the size of the Ridge's estimate.           As less distant lag variables should usually raise the time series
forecast, the coecients of more lagged variables should be penalized according to the lag of the variable.
   Park and Sakaori (2013) propose some types of penalties for dierent lags.                      Konzen and Ziegelmann (2016)

for α, where the set of possible values for α is [0, 0.5, 1, ..., 10]. We calculate the optimal λ among those possible for
that model with the lowest BIC value for each value of α. We choose the α value from that model that produces
the smallest BIC value among all possible α values, following Konzen and Ziegelmann (2016).



3.4 Exponential smoothing
   The name exponential smoothing comes from the weights decreasing exponentially when the observation becomes
older. We can represent the exponential smoothing methods as state space models (Ord et al, 1997, Hyndman et
al, 2002, Hyndman et al, 2005). The exponential smoothing method is an algorithm which only produces point
forecasts.   The stochastic state space model associated to this method provides a framework which leads to the
same point forecast but also estimates the prediction intervals for example (Hyndman et al, 2008).
   Economical series exhibit some features that can be worked on. We can break down the economic series into
certain components, such as trend (T), cycle (C), seasonality (S), and irregular or error (E). The exponential
smoothing method that we use consider the decomposition into these components. Only the cycle component is
not decomposed separately so that we model along with the trend component, following Hyndman et al (2005),
Hyndman and Khandakar (2008), and Hyndman et al (2008).                        Thus, we can combine the components of trend,
seasonality and error additionally or multiplicatively for example.
   Hyndman et al (2002), Hyndman and Khandakar (2008) and Hyndman et al (2008) propose 15 dierent com-
binations between trend and seasonality components. The trend component can present ve dierent possibilities:
none, additive, additive damped, multiplicative, and multiplicative damped. The trend component is a combination
between the level    (`)   and growth (b) parameter.      Consider      Th                            h periods, and φ is
                                                                             the forecast trend over the next
a damping parameter        (0 < φ < 1). So if there is                     Th = `. If the trend component is additive,
                                                         no trend component,
                                                                             2          h
Th = ` + bh.   If the trend    component is additive damped, Th = ` + φ + φ + · · · + φ     b. If the trend component is
                                                                                       (φ+φ2 +···+φh )
multiplicative,   Th = `bh .   If the trend component is multiplicative damped, T = `b       h         . If growth rate at
the end of the series is unlikely to continue, the damped trend seems to be a reasonable option.
   After we present the types of trend component, the next step is to detail the types of seasonal component.
The seasonal component can be none, additive or multiplicative.                   Also the error component can be additive or
multiplicative, but this distinction is not relevant to make point forecast (Hyndman et al, 2008).
   So, we consider the combination of ve types of trend component and three types of seasonal component which
leads to a total of 15 types of exponential smoothing methods that we consider in this paper, following Hyndman
and Khandakar (2008). We present these 15 possibilities in the Table 1, in which the rst entry refers to the trend
component and the second to the seasonal component. Some of these exponential smoothing methods are known
by other names. For example, cell       N, N represents the simple exponential smoothing method, cell A, N refers to
the Holt's linear method, and cell     Ad , N is associated with the damped trend method. The cell A, A describes the
additive Holt-Winter's method,       the cell A, M refers to the multiplicative Holt-Winter's method.




   For example, consider the Holt's linear method (cell             A, N )   that can be described as

where the rst equation (21) shows the model to the level of the series at time t                               `t ,   the second equation (22)
describes the growth rate (estimate the slope) of the series at time t                     bt . bt   is given by a weighted average of the
estimate of growth obtained by the dierence between successive levels and the previous growth   bt−1 . Finally, the
equation (23) presents the prediction for the variabley h periods ahead using information available at time t. This
equation describes that the forecast for the variable h periods ahead is given by the level in the current time `t
                                                                                                            ∗

   Consider a model with the seasonality component, when seasonal variations are constant throughout the series,
the additive method for the seasonal component is preferred. When seasonal variations change proportionally to
the level of the series, the multiplicative method for the seasonal component is preferred. Consider for example the
Holt-Winters method of additive trend with additive seasonal component (cell                           A, A),   the equations of this method
are given by

The equations (24), (25), (26), and (27) describe, respectively, the level             `t , the growth rate bt , the seasonality st ,
and the forecast    h   periods ahead of the series.          m is the length of seasonality (e.g., number of months or quarters
in a year), is the seasonal component, and              h+
                                                         m   = [(h − 1) mod m] + 1. The parameters of the Holt-Winters method
     ∗
(α, β , γ)   are restricted to lie between 0 and 1.
   Table 2 presents the equations for the level, growth, seasonality, and forecast of the series for                           h   periods ahead
for the 15 cases considered. Some values for exponential smoothing parameters lead to interesting specic cases.
Some examples are: the level remains constant over time if                    α = 0,   the slope is constant over time if           β ∗ = 0,   and
the seasonal behavior is the same over time if               γ = 0.   Finally, the methods       A    and   M   for the trend component are
particular cases of     Ad   and   Md   with   φ = 1.


   The next point is to discuss the state space models that underlie exponential smoothing methods. Each of the
15 models considered consist of a measurement equation that describes the data, and state equations that represent
how the unobserved components (level, trend, seasonal) modify over time.                             The measurement equation together
with the state equations are known by state space models.
   Hyndman et al (2002) propose to dierentiate the behavior of the model with additive errors in relation to the
multiplicative errors.       If the estimated parameters are the same, the point forecast is not aected if the error is
multiplicative or additive, only the prediction interval. When considering the behavior of the error, Hyndman et
al (2002) have the triplet         (E, T, S)   that refers to the three components: error, trend, and seasonality. The model
ET S(A, A, N )    means that the errors and the trend are additive and that there is no seasonality.

where      β = αβ ∗ .   Equation (28) refers to the measurement equation and equations (29) and (30) describe the state
equations for the level and growth respectively. Similarly, all 15 exponential smoothing methods presented in the
table 2 can be rewritten in the form of state space model with additive or multiplicative errors, see Hyndman et al
(2008) for example.
        Basically, the estimation procedure is based on estimating the smoothing parameters                    α, β , γ , φ   and the initial
state variables      `0 , b0 , s0 , s−1 ,   ...,   s−m+1   maximizing the likelihood function. The algorithm proposed by Hyndman
et al. (2002) also determines which of the 15 ETS models is most appropriate by selecting the model based on the
information criterion. The information criterion used to select the most appropriate model are Akaike information
criterion (AIC), AIC corrected for small sample bias (AICc), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), according
to Hyndman et al (2008).



4         Data and Empirical Strategy
        Our data is the Brazilian industrial production index at general level and your desagreggation by sectors.
The data source is the Monthly Industrial Survey of Physical Production (PIM-PF) of the Brazilian Institute
of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). We use monthly data from January 2002 to August 2017 without seasonal
adjustment. We consider the rst dierence of data to have stationary series, with exception of the UC-SV and
ETS models.
        The forecast is made for the general industry to analyze the use of aggregate data and from the industry sectors
we aggregate to get the general industry forecast. Thus we use the disaggregated data for the extractive industry
and the 25 sectors of the manufacturing industry. However, two sectors printing and reproduction of recordings;
and maintenance, repair and installation of machines and equipment only present data from January 2012 and
therefore we do not include these sectors in the estimates.
                                                                              1 Thus, our disaggregated sample includes the category

of extractive industries and 23 sectors of the manufacturing industry. Next we detail the empirical strategy and
how we compare the predictions obtained.



4.1 Empirical Strategy and Forecast Comparison
    We consider the model with up to 15 lags of the dependent variable and the selection of variables is based on
this set of covariates. Thus, we use a rolling window of 100 xed observations for each estimation for a forecast
horizon of 1 to 12 months ahead.              With this window size, we estimate with 61 samples for the general industry
series as for each of the sectors. We estimate the forecast for each sector and we use the of each sector to obtain
the forecast for the general industry from its components, thus obtaining the forecasts of the general industry from
the disaggregated data. For such recomposition, we consider the forecast of each sector by its weight and then we
sum to obtain the forecast from the disaggregated data. The forecast window for analysis ranges from September
2011 to August 2017.
    We compare our forecasts with the estimates of three naive models. The rst is the autoregressive model of the
rst order, the second is the time-varying parameters autoregressive model of the rst order, and the third is the UC
with SV. We estimate all models with the data for the general industry (aggregate forecast) and the forecast for the
general industry from the disaggregated data (disaggregated forecast). Thus, we have two naive predictions from
the AR (1) model (aggregate and disaggregated), two naive predictions from the time varying AR(1) (aggregate
and disaggregated), and two naive predictions from UC with SV (aggregate and disaggregated). The naive model
serves as reference or benchmark for the other forecasts. The performance analysis for the prediction of the models
will be through the mean square error (MSE) and from the test of Diebold and Mariano (1995) to determine if there
is a model with more accurate prediction for the general industrial production of Brazil for the period considered.
Next we present the test of Diebold and Mariano (1995).


4.1.1     Diebold and Mariano test


    The MSE is the sum of the dierence squared between the actual value of the data and the estimated value,
weighted by the number of terms.                The test of Diebold and Mariano (1995) shows if there is any model with
statistically more accurate prediction for the general industrial production of Brazil for the considered period.
Consider a loss function         g   based on forecasting errors, in which we consider a quadratic loss function. Assuming
two models (1 and 2), in which the forecasting errors                   ε̂t+h|t   for   h   period ahead are given by

test) denes that the model used as a reference leads to more accurate forecasts than the other. The Diebold and

5       Results
    This section presents the prediction of 1 to 12 months ahead for the naive models (AR(1), AR(1) with time-
varying parameters, UC with SV), besides the lag selection from the LASSO and its two variants (adaLASSO and
WLadaLASSO), and exponential smoothing ETS to predict the general industry from aggregated and disaggregated
data. We compare the results in two parts, from the MSE and the Diebold and Mariano (1995) test to obtain the
model with the most accurate forecast.

the MSE is smaller for the disaggregated models in relation to the aggregates independent of the forecast horizon,

with the exception of AR (1) with time-varying parameters and UC with SV. The model with the lowest MSE
for the prediction of one to seven months ahead is disaggregated ETS. Increasing the forecast time horizon mainly
from one to three periods ahead does not greatly aect the MSE of the disaggregated ETS. The WLadaLASSO
model for disaggregated data presented lower MSE for the time horizon of 8 to 12 months ahead. The dierence in
MSE between the LASSO models and variants is small mainly using disaggregated data, in which the disaggregated
WLadaLASSO performs better than the other LASSO methods disaggregated for the dierent forecast horizons.
In line with Konzen and Ziegelmann (2016), the WLadaLASSO disaggregated model performed better than the
LASSO and adaLASSO for disaggregated data. However, in the case of estimating the aggregate model, the LASSO
model presents better prediction performance in relation to its variants. An interesting point would be to try to
nd out why WLadaLASSO does not perform better than its variants for aggregate data or because there is this
performance dierence between aggregated and disaggregated data. Since Konzen and Ziegelmann (2016) point out
that WLadaLASSO would perform better when the sample is small and the greater the number of lags used but
we are not varying these two points.

   However, the MSE dierence does not allow to state if statistically the disaggregated ETS is higher in the
accuracy of the forecast in relation to the others. Therefore, we analyze the results of the Diebold and Mariano
(1995) test. In order to perform the test, we establish the disaggregated ETS as the benchmark model because it
has lower MSE of 1 to 7 months ahead compared to the rest of the models, indicating predictive power gains. We
compare the predictive errors of all models with those of the benchmark, having as null hypothesis the equality of
predictive power. Under the null hypothesis, the disaggregated ETS predicts as well as the analyzed model. The
alternative hypothesis indicates that the prediction of the disaggregated ETS is statistically better.
   Table 4 presents the Diebold and Mariano (1995) statistic and the associated p-value for each of the models
in relation to the benchmark.    From the results of the test of Diebold and Mariano (1995), we can consider
that the disaggregated ETS presents better statistical performance for prediction in relation to the naive models
(AR(1), AR(1) with time-varying parameters, UC with SV) considered with aggregate or disaggregated data and
the aggregate ETS. However, the disaggregated ETS model does not present better accuracy in relation to the
LASSO models and their variants, regardless of being aggregated or disaggregated.




Conclusions
   The present work seeks to analyze two points about the prediction of industrial production for Brazil.     The
rst is to compare dierent univariate models for selection of lags like LASSO and two variants, in addition to
the most suitable model for exponential smoothing.      Among these models, which type of model best forecasts

the industrial production in Brazil.   The second point is to consider whether the disaggregated data contribute
to predict the aggregate level of industrial production.     Basically our result points to a better performance of
models that use disaggregated data. The exponential smoothing model with disaggregated data in which we obtain
the best specication performs better in the forecast from 1 to 7 months ahead. The WLadaLASSO model with
disaggregated data oers better forecasting performance from 8 to 12 months ahead. However, the dierence in
prediction performance between the LASSO and its variants (adaLASSO, WLadaLASSO) is small when we consider
the disaggregated data.
   This is an ongoing research.   The next steps are to contemplate two additional models for prediction, which
is the selection between dierent models of neural networks of Crone and Kourentzes (2010) and Kourentzes et
al (2014), and the dynamic model averaging/selection framework of Koop and Korobilis (2012) and Raftery et al
(2010). Also we will compare the forecasts with model condence set of Hansen et al (2011).
