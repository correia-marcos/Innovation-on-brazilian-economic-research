ABSTRACT
This study seeks to understand the competitive pattern and strategy of the firms in the auto financing market.
First, we analyzed the strong segmentation observed in this market, determining market niches. We then
estimated reaction functions to price changes. The results indicated that the three largest companies in the sector
have a strong influence on interest rate setting within the entire segment. This phenomenon characterizes the
competition of this sector as the leader-follower type, rather than Bertrand competition, the latter of which is
often expected in the banking sector, and it demonstrates the existence of the leading firms’ high market power.

Keywords: reaction functions, auto financing, competition, market power.

1 INTRODUCTION

         This paper analyzes competition and market power in the auto financing loan market.
We use average weekly loan rates per institution to analyze the loan market. The study is
divided in two parts. First, we performed a descriptive data and market analysis. We showed
that it is possible to observe groups of firms with similar market positions and thus identify
market niches. Second, once we define the market segmentation, we derive and estimate price
reaction functions for the firms in each market niche (intra-niche) and between different
niches.
         We find that this market naturally segments into four segments: large (or leaders),
high-risk, automakers and financers. The large firms – Itaú-Unibanco, Bradesco, BV
Financeira and Santander – command approximately 70% of the market. High-risk firms
charge higher rates in serving customers with high credit risk. Automakers are financial
institutions that are owned by the automaker companies and are characterized by lower rate
offerings. Financers are firms that do not fit into any of the categories described above.
         The reaction function estimates show evidence that the three largest firms – Bradesco,
Itaú-Unibanco and BV Financeira – have a strong influence on interest rates within the entire
market. Among the large firms, Bradesco exerts price leadership.
         This result has two important implications. The first is evidence of a leader-follower
competitive structure featuring strong market segmentation. This finding stands in sharp
contrast to the Bertrand-type competition model expected to be found in the banking market
with homogeneous goods, which implies in fierce competition. A market with Bertrand-type
characteristics generates an equilibrium similar to that of perfect competition, which does not
appear to be the case in this sector. Segmentation reduces the number of firms that are
actually close competing, and the existence of leading firms may further reduce competition.
         The second implication is evidence that market power exists in this sector. The results
show that most financial institutions react to rate changes made by the leading banks,
representing evidence of the market power of these banks. This study is not suited for the
analysis of the existence of collusion in this sector. However, the results indicate that there is
potential for this type of action, which justifies the need for special attention from antitrust
authorities in this segment.
         The Brazilian automotive market has grown 42% between 2007 and 2011.1 This
growth was largely driven by a significant increase in the credit supply for auto financing,
which has grown from 19 billion dollars in 2004 to 93 billion dollars in 2010. This growth
represents an increase of over 400%.3 The strong expansion in the credit supply occurred
through a system of over 70 institutions that finance this type of credit.
         The automotive sector is constantly targeted by economic stimulus policies from the
government. This focus is at least partly due to the size of the auto industry and the high
multiplier impact that the industry has in other sectors of the Brazilian production matrix. The
success of these policies and the growth of the automotive sector largely depend on the
functioning of the credit system. Therefore, the efficiency of this market and the competitive
pattern of its firms have a central role in the success of these policies as well as in the
performance of the automotive sector as a whole.
         Despite the significant number of institutions granting this type of credit line, the
market is actually highly concentrated. Moreover, the competitive environment of the banking
and credit sector in Brazil is constantly questioned. There are several papers that attempt to

measure the degree of competition in the sector. Nakane (2002) and Belaisch (2003), among
others, have analyzed competition in the banking credit sector.4 In addition, high banking
spreads have recently been strongly questioned by the federal government. The finding that
drops in the basic interest rate (SELIC) do not translate to drops in the interest rates charged
by the banks has also drawn questioning.
        In this context of questioning of the competition level of the Brazilian credit market,
the present study attempts to analyze the pattern of competition in the segment of car purchase
loans.
        This study is divided into six parts. The next section provides a brief review of the
literature, focusing on models of price competition, bank competition and reaction function
models. Next is the data analysis, which features an exploration of the Brazilian banking
market and a preliminary analysis of the interest rates charged by banks in auto financing. In
the following section, a proposal is developed to formulate reactions to competitors.
Following a deeper data analysis, a market segmentation is suggested, and the reactions to
pricing variations in each segment are discussed. The sixth and last section concludes the
paper.


2 LITERATURE

        There is a literature that analyzes market power in the banking system. Nakane (2002)
tests the market power of Brazilian banks, using the methodology developed by Bresnaham
(1982) and Lau (1982). According to this methodology, market power is identified by
variations in the sensitivity of demand. However, such variation does not change the cost of
production or the marginal cost. Therefore, variations in the sensitivity of demand do not
change the equilibrium price of a perfectly competitive market, where the price equals the
marginal cost of production. However, if there is market power, it is beneficial to have a price
reaction against the price change of a substitute good.5 Nakane (2002) applies this
methodology to the loan market. The result indicates the existence of a competitive market,
with the cartel hypothesis being discarded.
        Belaisch (2003) developed another study on competition in the Brazilian banking
market. The author concludes that the Brazilian banking market behaves as an oligopoly,
especially due to the lack of incentive toward market efficiency. Therefore, the banking
spread (the difference between the credit-granting interest rate and the capital cost) increases,
discouraging increases in lending and capitalization. Nakane (2002) also emphasizes that such
studies do not allow the identification of the imperfect market structure to which the Brazilian
banking sector belongs: possible alternatives include the Cournot oligopoly, the Bertrand
oligopoly, the local monopoly or the leader-follower market (Stackelberg model). A further
study conducted by Petterini and Jorge Neto (2003) concludes that the Bertrand oligopoly
model is the market solution that most closely resembles the banking market in Brazil.
        According to Ferreira (2005), locations with several bank branches and high economic
activity have a relatively higher volume of credit and pay lower interest rates. In contrast,
regions served by fewer banks, where competition is weaker, feature higher rates. Ferreira
(2005) also finds that regions where the demand is lower do not involve a large number of

     Several competition models, Bertrand included, claim that the optimal response to a competitor price reduction
is to implement another price reduction.

banks, as the potential profits are not enough to cover the costs. In this competitive market,
profit evidently arises from differentiation strategies.

        Claessens and Laeven (2004) use the Panzar and Rosse’s (1987) method to measure
market power in 50 countries’ banking systems. They then related these measures to the
market structure and regulatory environment of these banking systems. Their main finding is
that banking system concentration does not explain market power. On the other hand, the
threat of entry and market contestability improves market competition.
        A study by Osawa (2008) analyzes the behavior of several customers when financing a
vehicle. The study assumes that consumers do not care about the interest rates charged as long
as the installment amount fits into the family budget. If the premise is validated, product
pricing (interest rate) will be less important than the financing term (which, when lengthened,
decreases the installment amount). The study finds a demand elasticity of -0.45. Therefore,
against popular belief, when seeking auto financing, customers evaluate the interest rate that
is being offered to them.
        According to Nagle (1984), the presence of fewer competitors in a given segment
leads to less elasticity; that is, the number of competitors in the market directly affects
pricing. In this market, it is common among customers seeking financing to have two or three
potential financial institutions with which to make a deal. In short, the author concludes that
we are facing a market in which customers care about price, and there is often the presence of
competitors. In this scenario, reactions to competitors’ price changes play an important role in
the pricing strategy of the companies in this sector.
        Several papers use reaction functions estimates to analyze market power and firm’s
strategies. Liang (1989) estimates price conjectural variations in the ready-to-eat breakfast
cereal market to measure the degree of price competition in a differentiated product oligopoly.
The empirical concludes that there is collusive behavior.
        In the marketing literature, Lazzarini et al (2007) studies competition among insurance
companies. They estimate reaction functions and conclude that pricing strategies are very
different across firms.
        Brueckner e Luo (2013) estimate reaction functions for the airline market where firms
compete in frequency of flights in a route. The authors argue that flight frequency is the main
quality atribute in this market. They find a positive relationship between the flight frequency
of competing firms.
       Dhar et al (2005) study the strategic pricing of Coca Cola and Pepsico leading brands
products. The paper adopts a structural approach with estimation of demand and pricing
equations. No support is found for Bertrand or Stackelberg type of competition.
        Vickner & Davies (1999) makes an empirical investigation about the market power
and the pricing conduct in a representative product differentiated olligopoly: the spaghetti
sauce market. It makes use of panel data to understand the price conduct and market power of
firms. It concludes that a portion of the market power of the firms is derived from a tacit price
collusion.
       Cotteril (2000) tries to understand the competitive interaction between private labels
and national brands in the retail food industry. According to the authors before trying to
understanding the nature of the competitive interaction between these two types of brands, it
is necessary to understand both demand and strategic price setting behavior by the firms. This

paper expands previous work by using a structural system of equations allowing both demand
parameters and simultaneous estimation of competitive interaction.

3 DATA

         Data from the Central Bank of Brazil show that as of October 2011, over 130 financial
institutions were approved to conduct bank clearing operations in the country. The magnitude
of the banking segment is routinely measured by the sum of assets of all financial institutions.
We note in Table 1 the evolution of banking assets in Brazil: in December 2007, assets totaled
R$2,519 billion, reaching R$4,271 billion in December 2010. An increase of approximately
70% is observed in this period.

        Among 2.1 trillion dollars of assets in loans in 2010, R$185 billion (approximately 4%
of the total) represent loans for auto financing for individuals, the focus of this work. As
observed in Table 2, this market shows steady growth from net financed assets of R$111
billion in 2007 to R$185 billion in 2010, representing growth of over 66%.

        On the whole, the auto financing market has the same structure as the banking sector:
a high number of competitors but high market concentration. Figure 1 shows that between
2008 and 2010, four institutions alone accounted for approximately 85% of all financed
assets. Specifically, in 2010, Itaú Bank accounted for 32% of all loans destined for individuals
for the acquisition of automobiles, BV Financeira (auto financing branch of Votorantim
Bank) had a 22% share, and Bradesco and Santander had shares of 18% and 14%,
respectively.

         To evaluate the price relationships, interest rates were collected from the Central Bank
of Brazil’s website (www.bcb.gov.br) for the acquisition of automobiles from 33 financial
institutions from January 19, 2009 to August 04, 2011. The data are presented as daily
measurements (except for weekends and bank holidays) in a panel structure; thus, there are
624 interest rate observations for each institution. As clarified by the Central Bank, “interest
rates disclosed represent the total operation cost for the customer, also including fiscal and
operational taxes. These rates correspond to the average charged rates in the period indicated
in the tables”; that is, each institution operating in this segment reports the arithmetic rate
average from all transactions performed on that day. The Special Clearance and Escrow
System (Sistema Especial de Liquidação e Custodia; SELIC) rate was also collected from this
website for the period in question.
         In Figure 2, it is possible to evaluate the average behavior of all consolidated
institutions. As we can see, for the period under review, the average rates fluctuate primarily
between 1.5% and 2.5% per month.

4 MODEL

        The following analysis is similar to the one developed by Lazzarini et al. (2007), who
use a market model of differentiated goods featuring price competition. The demand for firm
i's product is given by the following equation:

              𝑞! =    𝛼!! −    𝛼!! 𝑝! +                                               ! !
                                                                               !  !! 𝛼! 𝑝                 ,              𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒  𝛼!! > 0  𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝛼!!    ≥ 0    𝑖 ≠ 𝑗.

       Therefore, the quantity demanded for firm i’s product is negatively related to its price
       !
(𝑝 ) and directly related to the competitor’s price (𝑝 ! ). Assuming a cost structure with
constant marginal cost and fixed cost, we have the following profit equation:
                                                                                                                                                 7	  
	  



               𝜋 ! = 𝑝! − 𝑐 ! 𝑞! −    𝐹 ! =    𝑝! − 𝑐 !                         𝛼!! −    𝛼!! 𝑝! +                         𝛼!! 𝑝 ! −    𝐹 !
                                                                                                                  !  !!
Where:
         𝑐 ! = variable cost of firm i
         𝐹 ! = fixed cost of firm i

       Because the firm seeks to maximize profits, the best answer is given by the first-order
condition—namely,

                                                        𝑝! =    𝛽!! +                 𝛽!! 𝑝 ! ,        
                                                                              !  !!
where

                                                             !!! !  !!! !!                            !!!
                                                 𝛽!! =                         𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝛽!! =                     .
                                                                !  !!!                               !  !!!


        Therefore, the reaction function of firm i tells us that its price is a function of its
marginal cost and competitor prices. In the specific case of auto financing, we approximate
the marginal cost by the basic interest rate (SELIC), which is the main cost of funding for a
bank (see Koyama and Nakane, 2002). Therefore, 𝛽!! of the equation is separated in two parts
as follows:
                     !!!          !          !!!!
         𝛽!! =               and 𝛽!"#$% =             , where 𝑐! =    𝑝!!"#$% .
                    !  !!!                   !  !!!


       Note that we are only able to determine the β values in our estimation and that,
without more assumptions, it is not possible to identify the original demand parameters (α’s).
       To solve the general problem, it is necessary to develop a system of equations for n
market competitors, in which each company seeks to optimize its price as a function of the
competitors’ prices. However, in practical terms, we rarely know the competitors’ prices
simultaneously. According to Fudenberg and Levini (1999) and Lazzarini et al. (2007), one
way to obtain this equilibrium is to observe previous prices set by the competitor.
   With this information, the following dynamic reaction curve is found:
                                                                                      !
                               𝑝!! =    𝛽!! +    𝛽!! 𝑝!!!

                                                                     !  !! 𝛽!
                                                                                         .
                                                                                 𝑝!!! + 𝛽!"#$% 𝑝!!"#$% +    𝜀!! ,

where 𝑝!! denotes the price of firm i in time t, 𝑝!!!  is the lagged price of firm i, 𝑝!!! denotes
                                     !"#$%
competitors’ lagged prices, and 𝑝!   denotes the SELIC rate prevailing in the period. The
betas (𝛽) are the coefficients of each variable to be estimated.
        So, the question now is: what can we say about the market competition with the
reaction function estimates?
        Simply put, the model can identify between a perfect competitive environment,
oligopolistic competition – price leadership and non-leadership - and other competitive
environments. It is all based on the solely observation of price reactions and marginal cost.
        In a perfect competitive environment, the coefficients of the competitors’ prices
should be zero, since the pricing strategies of the other firms should have no influence, and a
firm’s own pricing should depend solely on marginal cost (SELIC).
                                                                                               8	  
	  


        There is market power when the competitors’ coefficients matter. In this case, firms
are indeed pricing strategically in an oligopolistic type of competition, and we can distinguish
between two situations: price leadership versus no leadership.
        No leadership means that firms have a similar degree of market power. For any two
banks, i and j, it implies that the coefficient of bank j is statistically different from zero in
bank’s i equation and vice-versa. We consider this case as a competitive oligopoly a la
Bertrand.
        For the price leadership case, suppose institution i is the leader and j is the follower.
Then, the price coefficient of firm i is relevant for firm j pricing strategy, but firm j has no
influence on firm i pricing strategy. It can have two interpretations, which we cannot
distinguish between them. It can be a competitive oligopoly with a price leader, or it can be a
cartel following a pricing rule based on some institution pricing decision. Since we cannot
rule out between these two situations, price leadership means that some institution is setting
the market price, but it can happen in a very distinct competitive environment.

5 MARKET SEGMENTATION

       Once the modeling is defined, the data are analyzed in greater depth. Examining the
average prices for each institution in the period of analysis and classifying them from the
highest rate to the lowest, we have the results shown in Figure 3.

         The right side of Figure 3 shows the average rate per month practiced by each
institution, whereas the left side of the figure shows the boxplot of the rates charged by the
institution. The average rate overall in the period under analysis was 2.06%. Cifra S.A. Bank
charged the highest rate (4.11%), and BMW Financeira S.A. charged the lowest average rate
(1.11%). These extremes illustrate the wide range of market prices. The automakers’ banks,
which are institutions that are part of the same financial group as the company that
                                                                                                 9	  
	  


manufactures the vehicles, work with average rates that are lower than the market averages.
Examples include BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, PSA Finance (Peugeot), Honda and
GMAC (Chevrolet). At the top of the chart, we note the presence of high-risk financers:
(Cifra, Omni, Daycoval, Pecunia), companies that finance vehicles for borrowers who present
a higher probability of default and that thus charge rates higher than the market average (for
more details, see Koyana, 2002).
        The left side of Figure 3 shows the boxplot of the institution rates. We observe that
some banks have higher rates of dispersion. These banks showed greater rate variance in the
period under review. It is interesting to note that the high deviation concentration is found in
the extremes of the graph, that is, in the companies charging average rates that are lower than
the market average (automaker banks) and those that are charging average rates above the
market average (high-risk financers).
        In the case of automaker banks, the high variance may be attributed to institutions that
occasionally offer rates subsidized by the automaker (such as zero-interest-rate deals). When
the deals are over, these firms return to offering standard rates. For example, Table 3 contains
information about BMW Financeira. It appears that the minimum rate and mode practiced in
the period was 0%, but in this zero-interest-rate scenario, and consequently, zero revenue, it is
impossible for the financial institution to break even. In reality, automakers subsidize the rates
to facilitate sales (i.e., the financial institution is paid for the sale via a commission from the
automaker and not through interest revenue).

        With regard to companies that charge high average rates, the high rate variance is
attributable to the profile of the customer buying the product. The probability of default is an
important variable in the definition of the interest rate (AFANASIEFF, 2001). Assuming that
companies should be sustainable and profitable, the interest rate charged should be compatible
with the customer’s credit risk. Table 4 presents a descriptive analysis of Omni Financeira.
The company has a monthly average rate of 3.79% (well over the value observed in Table 3
for BMW Financeira), its minimum observed rate is 3.21% (in another parallel, this rate is
well over the maximum rate charged by BMW of 1.92%), and its maximum rate is 5.66%.

             If we compare the data from automaker banks and high-risk financers, we can see that
     there is strong market segmentation, with customers of distinct risk profiles buying from
     specific segments. According to Kotler (2000), the division of the market into homogeneous
     groups allows for greater precision in defining market niches.
             We define high-risk companies as the financial institutions that charge interest rates
     above one standard deviation of the average rate (i.e., companies whose average rates offered
     for the period was above 2.24% per month).
             Thus far we have analyzed only the upper and lower sections of Figure 5: high risk
     and automakers. However, as shown in Figure 2 (data section), the majority of the sales (85%
     of the loans) were made by four firms: BV Financeira, Bradesco, Itaú and Santander. Their
     high market share renders it reasonable to classify these companies as the largest in the
     segment. This group is crucial to understand whether they exert some type of influence on
     other companies in the sector, such as a leader-follower game a la Stackelberg.
             In summary, we have described thus far three groups with specific particularities:
     financial institutions that are linked to automakers; banks that work with customers with high
     credit risk; and financial institutions with large market shares. Finally, other institutions that
     do not have any of the characteristics described above and are not significant classic players
     are classified as “financers”.
             Finally, the following segmentation of companies is created:

               To evaluate the segmentation adherence, the correlation of the average rate variations
       from each group is compared. Therefore, in the case of high-risk financers, for instance, for
       each observation period, the average rate among all companies composing the niche is
       calculated. Table 6 presents the results of the above analysis: all groups show positive
       correlations. That is, all segments tend to change prices in the same direction. If we observe
       the correlation of the high-risk group with the automaker group, for example, we note a
       correlation of only 0.18, demonstrating the existence of weak or no correlation. Another weak
       correlation is found among the high-risk companies and companies from the group of
       financers (0.34), which leads us to the same conclusion. The highest correlation found in the
       table is between the large companies and the financers group (0.52).

               Due to their high sales volume, the four companies classified as large are analyzed
       individually to understand the relationship between them and previously defined groups.
               Once the segmentation is defined, the modeling part of the problem begins: reactions
       to pricing changes between the large companies and the other market niches are sought. A
       series of average prices practiced in the period for each one of the groups is used (in the case
       of automaker banks, for instance, for each available observation day, the average rate between
       all banks classified as “automaker” is presented in Table 5).
               Before applying the model specified in Section 4, it is necessary to ensure that the
       equation to be tested does not have a unit root. To that end, the ADF test, which detects the
       existence of this problem, is applied.
               As observed in the first column of Table 7, analyzing the data in levels, it is not
       possible to rule out the presence of unit roots. Therefore, we estimate the model in
       differences, which eliminates the problem, as observed in the second column of Table 7.
       Therefore, the model is fit to the following specification:

                                                                                                   !

              Therefore, the variation of the competitor i price occurs as a function of its own past
       price variation, competitor and SELIC lagged price variation.

        We estimate a VAR (Vector Autoregressive) model in our problem. The VAR is
commonly used in systems of equations of interconnected time series to analyze random
shocks in a dynamic settting. It allows for contemporaneous correlation among the
disturbances, and therefore is preferable to estimating the equations independently. The
results are shown in Table 8.
        We observe in Table 8 the reaction curve estimates for the large companies and
segments. The columns indicate the segment or company under analysis, and the rows display
the explanatory variables for each segment or company.
        We note from the second column of the table that Bradesco Bank responds with price
changes to the institution’s own past movement. As argued by Lazzarini et al (2007), “pricing
of firms can be, in part, a result of their specific dynamics (for instance, a trend of cost
increase).” Moreover, the bank also responds with high intensity to price changes by Itaú and
with lower – but statistically significant – intensity to price changes by BV Financeira and the
group of financers. Also noteworthy is the lack of response by Bradesco with regard to the
interest rate movement of the high risk and automaker segments.
        We observe that if the coefficient of company j (𝛽!! ) is significant in the model of
company i, then the price of competitor j affects the demand of firm i. Therefore, the demand
for Bradesco’s auto financing is affected by price changes by Itaú, BV and the financers.
        The largest financer – Itaú, third column -responds positively to its own lagged moves,
to the price variation of Bradesco and to price changes made by financers. These companies,
when reducing their rates, also reduce the demand for the financing of Itaú, leading the bank
to optimally reduce its rate. It is interesting to note that Itaú does not respond to BV
Financeira’s price changes, although the latter company is the second-largest institution in
financing volume (see Figure 2).
        BV Financeira responds more strongly to price changes by Bradesco than to its own
rate variations. It also responds to price changes by Itaú Bank. It is the only company among
the large ones that does not show a price response to rate adjustments of the financers.
Apparently, the BV Financeira demand is impacted only by its two largest competitors: Itaú
and Bradesco.
                                                                                                               13	  
	  


       Evidence observed for Santander Bank show that the financial institution in question
responds with strong intensity to price changes by Bradesco and also responds to price
changes among financers and, surprisingly, high-risk financers. Interestingly, there is no
evidence that the bank significantly responds to price changes by Itaú or BV Financeira or to
its own historical price changes. Therefore, the Santander demand is apparently not directly
affected by the price fluctuations of the two largest companies of the segment.

         Next, the results referring to the average behavior of the segments are analyzed –
Columns 6 to 8 of Table 8. Financers respond to price changes by Bradesco and BV
Financeira and do not react to their own historical price changes. This group is the only group
among those under analysis that responds to the price changes among automaker banks,
indicating that the automaker banks’ pricing impacts the demand of the financers. There is no
evidence that the group responds to its own outdated price changes, which goes against the
initial perception that these firms are price followers—that is, that they observe price changes
by leaders and adjust their rates.
         While analyzing high-risk companies, we observed that they respond to price changes
by Bradesco and BV Financeira, especially to those by Bradesco (coefficients of 0.372 and
0.1122, respectively). Considering that they serve high-risk customers, firms in this niche
position their prices at a level higher than those of large companies and, as the large ones
move, change their prices in response (either by increase/cost reduction or through short-term
                                                                                            14	  
	  


changes). The segment bases its prices solely on price changes by the large companies, not
caring about their own prices in previous periods.
         Finally, automaker banks respond solely to interest rate changes by Bradesco Bank. It
is possible that the financing demand of this segment is linked to other factors, stronger than
the price offered by the competitors; that is, the automaker banks apparently have intense
strategic interactions with the other market segments.
         Table 8 presents some noteworthy findings. At the 10% significance level, no single
group or isolated company responds to changes in the SELIC rate. One possible explanation
is that changes in the SELIC rate are not quickly passed on to the customer. The strong impact
that the pricing of the large companies generally exerts on all the groups is also observed.
This evidence may indicate that the market works in sequential movements, in which market
leaders define their price and followers, realizing this movement, adjust their offerings.
Bradesco exerts a significant effect on the reaction curves of all groups and companies,
evidencing the strong leadership of this institution. In contrast, Santander Bank does not
present significant coefficients in the reaction curve of any company or bank, revealing the
company to be a price follower in this market.
         To better illustrate the results, the graphs below show some simulations of price
changes and the consequences in the market. Figure 4 shows the effects in the market of an
increase in Bradesco’s rate. In the simulation, the price of the institution in question is
increased by 10%, with its rate shifted from 1.95% per month to 2.15% per month. As
observed, immediately after the price change, all institutions and groups begin to reflect this
increase in their rates. In simulations, we note that an increase of 10% in Bradesco’s price
leads to a 2.6% increase for Itaú Bank, a 4.5% increase for BV Financeira, a 5.6% increase for
Santander, a 4.2% increase for automakers, a 5.2% increase for the high-risk group and a
3.9% increase for the financers.
         Following the same reasoning, a price increase of 10% is simulated for Itaú. As
observed in Figure 5, the increase causes slight increases in Bradesco’s price (+2.5%) and in
that of BV Financeira (+1.7%). Initially, the other institutions present no changes in their
pricing. If we compare Figures 6 and 7, we note that price changes by Bradesco have a greater
impact on the market than those by Itaú.

       As a third example, a 10% increase in Santander’s pricing is simulated. According to
Figure 6, this increase has no effect on the prices charged by the other companies and
segments; i.e., despite sudden price changes, the other competitors maintain their pricing at
previous levels.

and segments. Therefore, despite the sudden price change, the other competitors maintain
their pricing at previous levels.

        Another interesting analysis to conduct using a VAR model is the impulse-response
function. Briefly, an impulse response is the change in a dynamic system in response to an
external shock. In other words, we seek to understand what impact an exogenous impulse in a
system variable, ceteris paribus, has on the n equations of the system considered. The use of
the impulse-response tool may reveal the combined effect of the various segments as a
function of time.
        Figure 8 shows the impulse-response function for all the companies and company
groups in relation to a shock in Bradesco’s interest rate. Each sub-graph represents the impact
that the tested variable (in this case a shock in Bradesco’s interest rate) has on the analyzed
variables, considering all impacts in the other variables. The upper-right figure, for example,
shows the variation to the shock in the BV rate (y-axis) versus time (x-axis). As observed, all
groups react positively to the Bradesco shock, and this impact tends to zero in the long term
(demonstrating that the series are stationary).
        In practical terms, it is interesting to observe what total impact this shock will have on
the interest rate of each competitor. Figure 9 demonstrates this behavior, presenting the
accumulated impacts due to the shock in Bradesco’s interest rate. This shock is reflected as a
generalized increase in market interest rates, and the impact is largely absorbed by 6 periods
(business days) after the shock. Note that the response to changes in Bradesco’s rate are very
similar among all competitors (rate increases between 0.12% and 0.18%) except for Itaú,

which nonetheless presents a response of only 0.0018%. The accumulated effects in the large
banks tend to zero in the long run. Therefore, a Santander shock tends not to lead to price
increases.
        Finally, the above data and analyses support the inference that there exists evidence
that market price changes are largely affected by the three largest banks, showing that the
large market share of these companies enables them to define what interest rate levels will be
offered on the market in the short term. We are apparently facing a Stackelberg sequential
movement market model (with price as a control variable), in which the companies leading in
prices determine the rates that will be practiced and in which their followers set their own
rates as a function of the leaders’ movements. According to Shy (2001), in markets with
sequential movement, whose prices are primarily set by leaders, the industry reaps greater
profits compared with games with simultaneous moves, such as the Bertrand model. Given
this phenomenon, we may infer that the companies adhere to the behavior explained above, as
they understand that this behavior is the most efficient means of profit maximization.

6 CONCLUSIONS
        The current study aims to quantitatively evaluate responses to price changes in the
auto financing segment with a focus on the short term.
        The following evidence was observed. Despite the presence of substantial competition,
there exists a strong concentration of sales (i.e., financing) among four financial institutions
(Bradesco, BV Financeira, Itaú and Santander). The market features different segments, such
as banks that offer credit mostly for high-risk customers and thus charge higher financing
rates. Due to the heterogeneity of this market, the firms were grouped into four segments of
firms with similar characteristics: leaders, high-risk firms, automakers and financers.
        We then estimate reaction functions for the market players. The objective was to learn
how different firms and segments change their interest rates in response to price changes
made by other firms, and to make inference about the competitive environment of this market.
In conclusion, the majority of the market price changes are due to the three largest companies
in this sector – Bradesco, BV Financeira and Itaú – highlighting the strong influence of
Bradesco’s pricing policy on the other banks and market segments. This finding indicates that
the large market share of these companies enables them to substantially influence in the short
term the level of the interest rate offered in the market in the short term.
        For example, a 10% increase in Bradesco’s price produces a 2.6% increase in Itaú’s
rate, a 4.5% increase in BV Financeira’s rate, a 5.6% increase in Santander’s rate, a 4.2%
increase among the automakers, a 5.2% increase within the high-risk group and a 3.9%
increase among the financers. Analyzing the impulse-response functions, we note that a shock
in the market takes up to 6 periods (in this case, business days) to be accommodated by the
competitors and that its effect is directly proportional to the shock and decreases as a function
of time.
        The auto financing market is potentially characterized as an oligopoly with sequential
movements (similar to Stackelberg) in price, in which the leading companies in the sector
determine their price (in this case, the interest rate) and the other companies adjust their own
rates as a function of these changes. This market structure results in higher profits for the
industry as a whole and enables the leading companies to maintain greater stability and
assertiveness in their profits.
        Therefore, in the retail auto financing industry, companies that have greater market
share also have market power and are able to directly influence rates offered to the final
consumer. This finding shows that actions coordinated by the leading banks to increase the
average practiced rate are possible and thus presents a reason for antitrust policy attention.
Similarly, price reductions to gain market share may initiate a price war (that is, a process of
                                                                                                                        19	  
	  


price reductions far below what is economically viable) as competitors react by also
decreasing their prices.
