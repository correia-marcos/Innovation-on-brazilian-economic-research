RESUMO
A assistência técnica tem sido utilizada como instrumento para difundir novas tecnologias entre os
estabelecimentos agropecuários por meio de políticas governamentais como a Política Nacional de
Assistência Técnica e Extensão Rural (PNATER). Isto contribuído para incrementos de produtividade na
agricultura nas últimas décadas. No entanto, o efeito da assistência técnica sobre a oferta de produtos e
demanda de insumos não tem sido estudado de forma mais profunda. Nós abordamos esta questão
estimando um sistema de equações baseado em uma função de lucro quadrática normalizada para obter o
impacto da assistência técnica nas produções de milho, soja, café, cana de açúcar, leite, trigo e arroz, e nas
demandas de combustíveis e trabalho contratado. Nós estimamos oito equações de oferta e de demanda
utilizando a abordagem dos Mínimos Quadrados em Três Estágios para dois conjuntos de dados – um em
nível municipal e outro para fazendas representativas – com base no Censo Agropecuário de 2006. Nossos
resultados sugerem um efeito positivo da assistência técnica governamental na produção de soja, milho e
na demanda por combustíveis, enquanto que a assistência privada afetou positivamente as ofertas de soja
e trigo, e reduziu a utilização de combustíveis e trabalho contratado. Além disso, observou-se um salto
maior na oferta de soja com um aumento da assistência técnica governamental do que com a assistência
privada. Nós também identificamos que o efeito da assistência técnica privada aumenta a oferta das
commodities de acordo com o tamanho do estabelecimento, o que não foi identificado para a assistência
governamental.

ABSTRACT
Technical assistance support has been used as an instrument to spread new technologies across farms in
Brazil via governmental policies such as the National Policy on Technical Assistance and Rural Extension
(PNATER). It has contributed to productivity enhancement on agriculture in the last decades. However,
the effect of technical assistance support on agricultural output supply and input demands has not been
thoroughly studied. We address this issue by estimating a system of equations based on a quadratic
normalized restricted profit function to obtain the impact of technical assistance support on corn, soybean,
coffee, sugarcane, milk, wheat and rice supplies, and fuel and hired labor demands. We estimated eight
equations of supply and demand using an Iterated Three Stage Least Square for two sets of representative
scale data – a municipal scale and a farm representative– from the Brazilian Agricultural Census of 2006.
Our results suggest a positive effect of governmental technical support on soybean and corn supply and
fuel demand while the private support increases soybean and wheat supply and it saves on fuel and hired
labor. In addition, a larger shift on soybean supply was observed --doubling the share of farms that receive
governmental support over private support. We also found that private technical support effect on
commodities supply increases with farm size while the governmental support does not.
Key-words: Agriculture, Technical Assistance, Restricted Profit Function.

1. Introduction

    Brazilian agriculture has been experiencing a strong productivity enhancement in the last decades related
to technological change (Mendes et al. 2009, Bragagnolo et al. 2010, Helfand et al. 2015). Buainin et al.
(2013) asserts that the Brazilian agricultural performance is based on research, rural credit and rural
extension. Several studies have studied the role of research and rural credit on agriculture (Gasques et al.
2004, Melo et al. 2015 and Cardoso et al. 2012), but a few studies have investigated the relevance of
technical assistance and rural extension. Rodrigues (1997) and Peixoto (2014) highlight the relevance of
the effects of such policy on agricultural performance and other socio-economic aspects.
    On technical assistance support, the National Policy on Technical Assistance and Rural Extension
(PNATER)5 has been used to spread technical assistance support across the country in the last decades.
Christoplos (2010) describes the former as a policy that seeks to make it possible for farms to obtain new
technologies. Additionally, it aims to teach new agricultural techniques, advise on price analysis and
consult on farm management. PNATER, first implemented in 2003, added new goals to the former strategy
(ATER6) including managerial tools on more sustainable agricultural techniques – a more sustainable use
of natural resources (Ministry of Agrarian Development – MDA, 2016).
    Pettan (2010) and Peixoto (2009) highlight the increase on non-governmental institutions after the
introduction of PNATER. In 2006, more than 40% of the technical assistance was provided by non-
governmental institutions (private) (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics – IBGE, 2016). Both
research papers assert that private technical assistance support increased due to the restructuring of the
governmental ATER service, which it was scarce among small farms. It is worth to notice that although
private support lead to productivity and farm income enhancement it is still not affordable by all farms.
Thus, the aim of the PNATER is to meet the needs of these farms which cannot afford private support. A
larger participation of other than governmental institutions have been observed and also increased monetary
resources with the introduction of PNATER, from R$ 3 million in 2001/2002 to R$ 109 million in
2006/2007. However, only 22% of farms had access to any technical assistance on 2006, which were mainly
medium/large farms (IBGE, 2016).
    Several papers have analyzed Brazilian agriculture but without focusing on the relevance of technical
assistance support on its performance7. Overall, a positive effect of technical assistance on productivity
and/or production has been found (Moura et al. 2000, Freitas et al. 2014, and Helfand and Levine 2004).8
In this paper, we address this issue directly seeking to evaluate the effect of technical assistance support on
agricultural output supplies and input demands. In addition, we seek to investigate the impact of both
private and governmental technical assistance support. We are not aware of any other paper that analyzed
specifically the effect of technical assistance on Brazilian Agriculture performance using this approach.
    Our research focuses on the major agricultural commodities and inputs to estimate a system of equation
based on the derivative properties of a quadratic normalized restricted profit function. We use data ata
municipal scale and at farm level (a representative farm of differing sizes) from the Brazilian Agricultural
Census of 2006. Specifically, we estimate a system of equations using Iterated Three Stage Least Square,
which includes seven commodity supplies and two input demands to evaluate the impact of governmental
and private technical assistance support as supply and demand shift. Our results have shown that technical
assistance support positively impacts soybean, corn and wheat supplies and fuel and hired labor demands.
For instance, on average, an increase of 10% on the share of farms that received governmental technical
assistance support results in an increase of 16% of soybean supply while an increase on private support
results in only 5.4%.
    The remainder of this study is divided in five sections, section 2 presents a brief description of the
background on technical assistance support in the Brazilian agricultural sector. Section 3 illustrates the

and cost functions (Birkhauser et al. 1991, Oehmke et al. 1997, Van Rijn et al. 2015).

 Campos (2011) has found a non-significant negative effect of technical assistance.
                                                                                                                              2
theoretical framework adopted. It is followed by data description and the empirical specification in Section
4. Section 5 discusses the results and section 6 is the conclusion.

2. Background

    Bergamasco (1983) indicates that technical assistance support has been occurring a long time in the
Brazilian agriculture, since century XIX, but Pettan (2010) argues that most of it was realized by non-
governmental institutions (private) and aimed to broadcast new techniques (in-farm training). Bergamasco
(1983) also asserts that this type of technical assistance support took place until the late 1940’s when ATER
started to being formed, known as Technical Assistance and Rural Extension. She also highlights its
positive effect on socio-economic (and income) aspects, which it was based on U.S. system.
    However, Alves (2013) suggests a bias on ATER support toward larger farms and more developed
agricultural regions. Figure 1 illustrates regional disparities o technical assistance support across the
country. Municipalities on the south and southeast region have higher share of farms which have received
any technical assistance support. Kageyama (1990) also states that family own-farms have been suppressed
of ATER services.
   The National Policy on Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (PNATER) was created in 2003 by
the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA). Peixoto (2009) argues that the National Policy on Family
Own-Farm (PRONAF), established in 1996, represented a seed to the PNATER establishment. PNATER
was structured as decentralized ATER service system, where non-governmental institutions would
participate actively (Peixoto 2009). Its implementation introduced raised more resources to ATER services,
from R$ 3 million on 2001/2002 crop season to R$ 626 million on 2009/2010 crop season. Soares (2007)
indicates that family own-farms gained more attention under this new system, where this category
experienced an increase of 35% on ATER services received during the period 2002-2007.

   There is a vast international literature that investigates the outcome of ATER policies. The major
assertion of these studies is the positive effect of this support on new technology propagation. Christoplos
(2010) also suggested the broadcast information an important effect of these policies. Anderson and Feder
(2004) identified its high impact on farm productivity and income enhancement mainly in developing
countries while Landini (2016) highlights its influence on organization of farmers.

   Shakya and Flinn (1985) found that rice farms in Nepal that received technical assistance support had
shown a higher likelihood of adopting a new technology. They measured technical assistance support as
yearly number of attending visits to the farm and new technology adoption as use of fertilizer and new
varieties in rice. On the other hand, Gautam (2000) found a non-significant effect of rural extension on
productivity9 enhancement in farms on Kenia. The major conclusion is that the ATER policy has limited
range given it has positive effect only on less productivity farms. Jim and Huffman (2016) have found a
positive and strong impact of rural extension on total factor productivity (TFP) for the 48 U.S. states during
the period 1970-2004. A smaller effect but still positive was found for public investment on agricultural
research.
   There are a few recent studies that have investigated directly technical assistance support for Brazilian
agriculture. Several of them examine technical assistance effect only on farm efficiency such as
inGonçalves et al. (2008), Helfand and Levine (2004) and Freitas et al. (2014). Overall, they have found a
positive effect. The former found a stronger effect on larger farms and non-significant effect on small farms.
Pereira et al. (2010) address this issue differently. They sought to investigate the determinants of post-
harvest technologies on coffee production in a Southern Brazilian state, Minas Gerais. They have found a
positive impact of technical assistant support (measured as employee training) on adoption of new
technology, although monetary return, farmer characteristics and being in a cooperative had played a more
relevant role.

3. Theoretical framework

    There is a widespread literature on output supply and input demand shift influenced by quasi-fixed
factors from a restricted profit function (Diewert, 1974; Lau, 1976; Diewert, 1971). The latter function
represents the profit in the short run where some of the inputs have little or zero mobility during a short
period, which implies time and cost to adjust (Huffman and Evenson, 1989), named quasi-fixed inputs. In
this paper, we modeled technical assistance as a quasi-fixed input in a restricted profit function since it
affects commodity production as an input but it is not flexible (i.e. labor). Several papers have used this
approach to evaluate public policies and research and development impacts such as Shumway (1983),
Huffman and Evenson (1989) and Fulginiti; Perrin, 1990. As mentioned before, this approach will permit
to evaluate the impact for being assisted on commodities supply and input demands.
    According with Lau (1976), a multi-output and multi-input production can be represented considering
𝑦𝑖 , 𝑖 = 0, 1, … , 𝑛 + 𝑚, as vector of inputs and outputs. A numeraire output is represented by 𝑦0 , outputs by
𝑦𝑖 > 0 , 𝑖 = 0, 1, … , 𝑛, where 𝑛 represents outputs, and for 𝑚 inputs 𝑦𝑖 < 0, 𝑖 = 𝑛 + 1, … , 𝑛 + 𝑚. The
quasi-fixed factors such technical assistance are represented by 𝑧𝑘 , where 𝑧𝑘 ≥ 0, 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐾.
    The transformation curve associated to the multi-output and multi-input described is a function of all
these variables 𝐹(𝑦0 , 𝑦1 , … , 𝑦𝑛 , 𝑦𝑛+1 , … , 𝑦𝑛+𝑚 ; 𝑧1 , … , 𝑧𝐾 ) = 0. Under perfect competition on output and
input markets and a technology that satisfy monotonicity and convexity, a normalized restricted profit
function is 𝜋 = 𝐹(𝑝1 , … , 𝑝𝑛 , 𝑝𝑛+1 , … , 𝑝𝑛+𝑚 ; 𝑧1 , … , 𝑧𝐾 ) where 𝑝𝑖 = 𝑃𝑖 ⁄𝑃0 , 𝑃0 represents the price of the
numeraire output 𝑦0 , and 𝑃𝑖 is the nominal price of each other input and output 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛 + 𝑚.

                                                  𝜋 = 𝐹(𝑝, 𝑧)                                                          (1)

where 𝜋 is the normalized restricted profit (𝜋 = 𝜋 ′ /𝑃0 ), where 𝜋 ′ is the nominal profit), 𝑝 is a vector of
𝑛 + 𝑚 normalized prices, and 𝑧 is a vector of 𝐾 quasi-fixed inputs. The normalized restricted profit
function is homogeneous of degree one with respect to prices (which is imposed by dividing by one of the
prices), non-decreasing in output prices and non-increasing in input prices (monotonicity in inputs and
outputs), symmetric (which is also imposed in the estimation), and is convexity in prices (second order
derivatives matrix is positive semidefinite).

 Two components were considering within the productivity effect estimation – efficiency and technical – using two different
non-parametric methodologies (Data Envelopment Analysis and Malmquist Index)
                                                                                                                              4
   We assume that all farms are profit maximizers on a perfect competition structure, so the supply curve
and input demand can be recover by envelope theorem using the first derivative (which by the monotonicity
property will have the following sign)

  We obtain the effect of a quasi-fixed input on commodity supply and input demands (shift on supply or
demand).

where 𝜇𝑧𝑘𝑖 represents the commodity supply of input demand individual shift and, according to Huffman e
Evenson (1989). Theoretically, a sign is not excepted for equation (4), but since we expect a positive effect
of being supported by technical assistance on commodity supply we expect these equations to show a
positive value when 𝑦𝑖∗ is representing an output.

4. Empirical application
   4.1.Data

    We use the Agricultural Census of 2006 made available by IBGE. At first, we use municipal data scale
to achieve our objective. Our data set initially is formed by 5.548 observations but as noted in previous
studies, such as Helfand et al. (2015), outliers affect heavily the estimation. Thus, we dropped all
observations with normalized prices higher than its mean added by one and a half standard deviation,
leading to a total of 4.678 observations that will be used. Table 1 displays descriptive statistics of the
variables considered in our model for this set of observations. For example, the mean coffee price changes
from R$ 890 to R$ 758 after controlling to outliers. In the extension part we use representative farm scale10
to estimate the effect ATER on agricultural commodity supplies and input demands. In a later section we
describe this procedure.
    We chose the outputs based on its monetary relevance on total agricultural production in each region,
such as in Huffman e Evenson (1989) and Figueiredo e Teixeira (2002). Output quantities of soybean, corn,
sugarcane, coffee, rice, wheat and milk are in tons, while the output prices were obtained by the ratio of
production value and production output, such as in Pereda (2012) and Figueiredo (2002). Figure 2, in
Appendix C, shows the distribution of some of this outputs across the country. Some products are produced
regionally such as soybean, wheat and sugarcane while other are spread across the country such as corn.
Some states are well known as agricultural producers such as Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, and have shown
high level of production in different outputs.

    In the input side we chose two factors as variable inputs, hired labor and fuel. For the former, input
price was calculated as the ratio of labor expenses by its quantity while for the latter was by the ratio of
fuel expenses by its quantity. We decided for using fuel as variable input to capture a measure of farm
capital use, as argued by Burniaux and Truong (2002) and Pereda (2012).

    Technical assistance support is a quasi-fixed input represented in two variables, governmental and
private technical assistance support. Around 14% of farms in each municipality received governmental
technical assistance support, while only 4% received any private support. As shown in Figure 1, the latter
support is mainly concentrated on the south and southeast regions. Also in Figure 1, it is worth to notice
how spread is the governmental technical assistance support is, although with lower attainment in each
municipality. We also add irrigated area as a quasi-fixed.

technology such as Shumway (1983), Shumway et al. (1988), Huffman and Evenson (1989) and Schuring

forms are usually used for restricted profit functions: transcendental logarithm (translog), quadratic
normalized and generalized Leontief11. Chambers et al. (2013) indicated that the quadratic normalized is
superior than the other using a Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, we use a quadratic normalized restricted
profit function to represent the Brazilian farms, represented in its matrix form, as described in Fulginiti
(2010)

irrigated area and a dummy identifying farms in Brazilian South and Southeast regions as quasi-fixed

where this equation can take any sign12.
    Symmetry and homogeneity were imposed on the estimation but monotonicity (sign of the equations
(7a) and (7b) that represent supply and demand) was not and it was checked in the results. Monotonicity,
in special, has an important effect on the elasticity calculation. The elasticities standard errors were obtained
using Delta method13. All procedures were done using Stata 14, with the code reg3.

5. Results and discussion

    A system of equation was estimated using Iterated 3SLS considering seven supplies (corn, soy, milk,
coffee, sugar, rice and wheat) and one input demand (fuel). Hired labor price was used as normalizer price
and was estimated after using of the symmetry property. Overall14, the estimation presented a good fit.
Most of the coefficients were statistically significant (around 67% of the coefficients were significant at
10%), monotonicity15 was satisfied in at least 90% of the observations within outputs/inputs directly
estimated in the system of equation. Table 2 displays the results in the Appendix B.
    Most of the elasticities have presented a correct theoretical sign. The own-price elasticities and cross-
price elasticities are displayed in Table 3. All own price elasticities are correctly signed, where output
supply shows a positive elasticity and input demand a negative sign, except the own elasticity for
sugarcane16. Own price elasticity for all outputs and input demand of fuel and hired labor are statistical
significant. Rice, corn and coffee was the output with larger price-effect compare to the other outputs – an
increase of 10% on its price would lead to an increase on supply of these products by 34%, 6.7% and 4.3%,
respectively. Castro (2008) when estimating a profit function for Brazil (not per municipality, which is
more aggregated) found a significant own-price elasticity for rice and corn of 0.43 and 0.21. On the other
hand, soybean and corn have shown to be inelastic.
    Both inputs have shown to be elastic. However previous studies such as Figueiredo (2002) haven’t
found a consistent result for input elasticities either. It is worth to notice that an increase in fuel prices
would lead to a decrease in supply of agricultural commodities. Wheat and rice are the outputs more
sensitive to changes in input prices. We have found that wages (hired labor prices) have an expected sign
on soybean and milk, but not in the other outputs such as in Figueiredo (2002) and Castro (2008). Fuel and
labor are substitutes, given the positive sign on their cross-elasticity. Additionally, soybean and corn supply
are substitute given that both outputs are used on animal feed. In addition, as expected, milk and corn are
complements given that corn is used as cattle feed.
    Irrigated area was statistically significant for all commodities supply and input demands. A positive
effect of the latter was found in the output supplies, with a larger effect on corn, rice and soybean. Our
dummy variable identifying municipalities in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil (more agricultural
developed regions) was statistically positive on sugarcane, coffee and wheat supply but negative for
soybean supply. This outcome is related to the geographical distribution of their production, as you can see
in Figure C1, in appendix C. Soybean production is also largely produced in the Midwest region.

   However, we did not find a negative elasticity for sugarcane when we estimate the system of equations using the data set at
farm scale.

    We estimated the supply and input elasticities with respect to the quasi-fixed inputs to evaluate the impact
of technical assistance support on agriculture. Table 4 reports them. An increase of 10% on the governmental
support leads to a statistical increase of around 16% on soybean supply and an increase of 3% and 4.6% on
corn supply and fuel demand, respectively. Interestingly, we found a significant and negative effect of this
type of support on milk supply, although Campos (2011) has also found a negative effect of governmental
technical assistance support on dairy farm efficiency.

    Private technical assistance support has impacted positively and significantly soybean and wheat supplies,
while negatively sugarcane supply and fuel demand. On average, an increase of 10% on the number of farms
that received private technical assistance support would lead to an increase of 5.4% and 8.4% on soybean and
wheat supply, respectively. Private technical assistance support is fuel and labor saver. We conclude based on
these results that private technical assistance support is more effective than the governmental support given
that is cost reducer.
    We have found a much higher impact of technical assistance support than Evenson, Cruz and Avila (1988),
which found that an increase of 10% on this support would lead to an increase of 0.2% on corn supply and
0.7% on livestock products supply. However, they haven’t disaggregated technical assistance support in
governmental and private, used similar framework and neither considered more agricultural commodities.
    Figure 2 illustrates how the supply of soybean shifts right (increases) with a higher technical assistance
support, independently whether governmental or private, as Table 4 shows. We considered the median
technical assistance support to build these curves, for the gov. support it is 0.086 while for private is 0.0172.
In both graphs the curve S0 represent the same level (holding all the other variables at their median) while S1
represents the same level but doubling technical assistance (i.e. 0.086 x 2 = 0.172 for governmental technical
assistance support). It clearly shows a large effect of technical assistance and it highlights the relevance of
governmental policies toward technical assistance support enhancement.
    Alves (2013) and Kageyama (1990) highlights a higher access of larger farms to technical assistance
support, which might be correlated to farmers’ access to rural credit. Plata and Fernandes (2011) pointed out
that the average farm size that received any technical assistance support was of 228 hectares while the farmers’
that did not received had an average farm of 42 hectares. It clearly shows a bias on the distribution of technical
assistance support.
    As mentioned in previous section technical assistant support has been bias toward larger farms, under
attending to small farms. Thus, we also estimated the system of equations considering four different farm sizes:
zero to ten hectares, ten to 100 hectares, hundred to thousand hectares and larger than thousand hectares. We
constructed representative farms per size by dividing the output by the number of farms in each of the
categories in addition to including farm size dummies. This procedure is well used in the literature such as in
Helfand et al. (2015). Here, we present only the results of technical assistance support by farm size (table 5).

                       where the median is multiplied by two.

                           Table 5 shows that governmental technical assistance support has a higher impact within small suppliers
                       of soybean, milk and corn while for other outputs its effect does not differ across farm sizes. However, private
                       technical assistance support has a higher effect on most of output supply on larger farm sizes but milk supply.
                       This outcome was expected given that small farms cannot afford this expenses, relying more on governmental
                       technical assistance support. Interestingly, technical assistance support is less fuel demand saver as farm size
                       increases, which might be related to modernization of farm production since larger farms have higher access
                       to credit and, thus, they are more capital intensive.

                           In short, our preliminary results suggest that a system of Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (ATER)
                       that includes both governmental and private support, as proposed by the PNATER, is more effective given its
                       complementarity impact on agriculture. It corroborates what was suggested by Peixoto (2014). Governmental
                                                                                                                                                                                          11
policy on ATER has supported small farms while farms that can afford private support has been seeing gains
in supply outcome due to its use.

6. Conclusions

    In this paper, we seek to evaluate the impact of the National Policy on Technical Assistance and Rural
Extension (PNATER) as well as the overall technical assistance support, which also includes private support.
We estimated a system of agricultural supplies and input demands based on a restricted normalized quadratic
profit function at municipal and farm (representative) scale. Overall, our preliminary results are robust with
theoretical properties and could be used as guidance on policy design.
    We have found that governmental technical assistance support affects positively soybean and corn supply
while private support drives the supply of soybean and wheat up. As expected, private support has a higher
effect on commodities supply on larger farms while governmental support has on smaller farms, with some
exceptions. A higher investment on ATER accompanied by decentralization of it and association with different
institutions, including private, would lead to an increase of farm income via higher output supply and input
saver.
    This is on-going research where valuable and reliable results have been found in a first step. In the nearby
future we will be estimating this framework on a farm level scale available on the Agricultural Census of 2006,
at IBGE. A more rigorous and robust analysis will be achieved and better policy resolutions could be drawn
from it.

order derivatives matrix (Hessian) or convexity of the restricted profit function. The cross-price elasticity (or
the effect of a change in input price on output supply or vice-versa) can be found by
