Abstract
This paper evaluates the impact of the Brazil’s National Program for the Strengthening of Family
Farming (Pronaf) on the time allocation of members inside the households. We use data from the
2014 Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD) and we apply methods for propensity
score using complex surveys recently recommended in the literature. We find that Pronaf helps to
increase productivity through an increased focus in the agricultural activities, but it also stimulates
female partners to engage in unpaid work. The results show significant effects of Pronaf on child
labor and on the gender-specific division of labor inside the households, while it does not have the
usual adverse effects of microcredit programs on school enrollment.

1. Introduction
    Rural households in developing countries are usually affected by credit constraints due to lack
of information, less tangible assets to pledge as collateral, contract enforcement problems, as well
as the poor financial development of these countries. The existence of specific lines of credit tar-
geted to family agriculture helps to provide financial services, such as loans, that allow households
to take advantage of productive opportunities. Since the households’ members have heterogeneous
preferences, the allocation of time in productive and leisure activities as a response to the contracting
of a loan may change between men, women and children inside the household. The possibility of
accessing new technologies by increasing their funding capacity may have welfare consequences for
the household’s gendered division of labor, as pointed out by Haile et al. (2012).
    Although there are evidences in the literature that microfinancing institutions can help to raise
income and consumption levels of households, reduce income inequality and enhance welfare, - such
as Mahjabeen (2008) for Bangladesh and Li et al. (2011) for China - a recent randomized evaluation
performed by Banerjee et al. (2015) in the slums of Hyderabad in India suggested that households
which received loans invested more in their existing businesses, but there were no changes in any of
the development outcomes that are often believed to be affected by microfinance, including health,
education, and women’s empowerment. At the same time, the household’s access to microcredit
may have unintended consequences such as an increase in child labor, as reported by Hazarika and
Sarangi (2008) in rural Malawi, which may serve as a channel through which rural households reduce
their demand for their children’s schooling, as reported by Maldonado and González-Vega (2008) in
Bolivia.
    Rural credit from microfinancing institutions is specially important in countries where the rural
population faces tighter credit due to lack of access to the formal banking system. The supply of
rural credit for family farming in Brazil has traditionally been restrained due to the collusive structure
of the banking system and the substantial presence of large landholdings in rural areas (Maia et al.,
2016). These factors are responsible for the existence of market failures which justify the formulation
of public policies for family farming in Brazil. In the last two decades, rural credit programs financed
more than 50 billion dollars in around 27 million contracts for different types of farmers in Brazil.
In 2014, the agribusiness sector, including production agriculture and processing and distribution,
accounted for 21 percent of Brazil’s GDP (Vendemiatti Junior and Clerk, 2016). The magnitude of
this public policy and the importance of agricultural production in Brazil’s GDP makes it one the
most important countries to study the effects of rural credit on the time allocation of members inside
the households.
    In this paper we evaluate the impact of the most widely disseminated rural development policy
in Brazil which is characterized by funding family farming through low interest rates: the National
Program for the Strengthening of Family Farming (Pronaf). We are interested in studying whether the
households benefited from Pronaf change their decisions of time allocation between their members, an
evaluation that has not been done in the literature until now. We are able to identify the beneficiaries of
Pronaf through data from the 2014 Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD), which is
held by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), and we estimate the effect of receiving
credit from Pronaf by applying methods of propensity score using complex surveys recently suggested
in the literature (DuGoff et al., 2014; Austin et al., 2016). Such evidences may help to answer the
following questions: i) Do couples tend to increase focus in the main productive activity once they
receive funding?; ii) Does microfinancing have an impact on women’s insertion in the labor market
and the gendered division of labor?; iii) What are the undesirable effects of such policies in terms of
child labor and school attendance?
    Our results show that Pronaf helps to increase productivity through an increased focus in the agri-
cultural activities, but it also stimulates female partners and female adolescents to engage in unpaid
work. We show strong evidence that female partners and their children are helping the male heads

of family in the agricultural activity while other female members of the family are left to perform
domestic tasks. This implies that Pronaf enhances a division of labor based on the gender and the role
of the person in the family and it may have negative effects in terms of child labor. However, we did
not find evidence of an adverse effect of Pronaf on school enrollment.
     The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we present a brief theoretical and empirical
literature review about the impact of rural microcredit on welfare and time allocation. In section 3
we describe the functioning of Brazil’s National Program for the Strengthening of Family Farming
(Pronaf). In section 4 we point out the data we used and the econometric methods we applied in
this paper. In section 5 we present and discuss the results. In section 6 we perform some robustness
regressions and sensitivity analysis to further investigate our results. Finally, in section 7 we make
our final remarks about this study.

2. Brief literature review
    The economic approach traditionally analyzes the problem of allocating family’s resources as a
problem of maximizing an homogeneous unit, in which income and its distribution among family
members are part of the same set of preferences (unitary model). In the common case of a family
where its members have the same preferences and the resource allocation is solved through a cen-
tral planner, the final allocation follows the solution of a utility maximization problem with family
members dedicating their time to activities with the best comparative advantage (Becker, 1965, 2009).
    The problem of time allocation becomes more interesting when some of the usual assumptions
are relaxed. Traditional models analyze income as the sum of the incomes of family members, and
a marginal change in the income of a family member has the same effect on the labor supply of a
change in the income of other members. In the words of Gary Becker: "Members who are relatively
more efficient at market activities would use less of their time at household activities than would other
members" (Becker, 1965).
    New models that relax these hypothesis became known as bargain models (Udry, 1994; Haddad
et al., 1997; Cuesta, 2004). Within the bargain models approach, interaction between family members
can have elements of cooperation and conflict at the same time. Cooperation is maintained as long as
the gains of family members are greater than in the case of conflict. However, under the assumption
of heterogeneous preferences for each family member, the results depend on the relative bargaining
power of each member (Agarwal, 1997).
    One of the main applications of bargain models is the study of time allocation of married cou-
ples and their children. In the case of family farmers, the optimal decision of a household may be
influenced by the supply of credit available, since it changes relative prices and affects the marginal
income of labor, which reflects the opportunity costs of leisure. The recent expansion of microcredit
programs for rural workers may have various positive or negative social outcomes in terms of the
optimal decision of time allocation inside the households.
    Microfinance is seen as a key development tool and one of the most widespread assistance pro-
grams, which include services such as microcredit, microsavings, microinsurance, and cash transfers.
These programs enable microentrepreneurs to build businesses and increase their income, as well as
reduce poverty in developing countries. By providing financial services through lines of credit tar-
geted to the poor, microfinance programs enhance the capability of the beneficiaries to invest, save
and acquire productive assets and human capital, which may improve other non-financial outcomes,
such as health, food-security, nutrition, education, women’s empowerment, housing, job creation, and
social cohesion (Van Rooyen et al., 2012).
    Rural credit is one of the main avenues for microcredit policies. In the literature on economic
development, there are a number of studies dedicated to assess the effects of rural development poli-
cies on indicators of productivity and welfare of beneficiaries. Such as Khandker and Faruqee (2003),

who used a sample of 217 villages and 4380 families in Pakistan to find, through the method of instru-
mental variables, that rural credit contributed to increasing domestic welfare and its impact is greater
for small landholders than for large ones. They also found that women’s working hours are more
affected by rural credit than men’s. Also, Mazumder and Lu (2015) found that microfinance appears
to increase basic rights and improve rural livelihood in Bangladesh, while the positive changes are
consistently higher in non-governmental microfinance recipients.
    The literature have also questioned some of these positive impacts. Banerjee et al. (2015) have
found no significant changes in health, education and women’s empowerment from a randomized
evaluation of a group lending microcredit program in Hyderabad, India. Islam and Choe (2013) have
found evidence of an increase in child labor and a decrease in school enrollment for a microcredit
program in rural Bangladesh. More specifically, the authors used a sample of 2034 families with
children with 7 to 16 years old and found that the girls’ education are negatively affected if the father
or mother received microcredit. This adverse effects are more pronounced in poorer and less educated
households, while girls are more affected than boys, and younger children are more affected than older
ones.
    In addition, part of the literature on microcredit has studied its impact on the time and labor
allocation within the household. Swaminathan et al. (2010) examined the influence of formal and
informal access to credit by men and women in Malawi through the use of instrumental variables
and found that formal credit programs that intended to target women for self-employment are indeed
engaging women in such activities. At the same time, Shimamura and Lastarria-Cornhiel (2010)
reveal that, when working adults become more involved in income-generating activities financed by
credit, young female children in Malawi may be exploited as child labor either at home or in the field,
since credit uptake decreased school attendance.
    Pronaf is the main rural development program in Brazil, and while there are some works that
measured the effect of Pronaf on productivity and consumption, there is no empirical evidence of its
effects on the time allocation within the households. The lack of substantial empirical evidence is due
to the fact that Pronaf did not undergo any experimental evaluation phase, and as Castro et al. (2014)
pointed out, the objectives of Pronaf are not easily matched with quantitative variables.
    Through the use of data from the Brazilian Agricultural Census, Garcia et al. (2016) evaluated the
effects of the interaction between Pronaf and Bolsa Família1 on land productivity, income per family
worker and child labor in municipalities with higher incidence of agrarian establishments benefited
from the programs. The authors found evidence of positive synergy effects between the two programs
on land productivity and income per household worker in the establishments. However, attention
is drawn to the evidence that Pronaf is at least positively correlated with child labor in agricultural
establishments, a clearly undesirable outcome.
    Maia et al. (2016), using the Brazilian Agricultural Census and propensity score matching models,
found that individuals who had access to Pronaf had a positive and significant net increase on the
production of about 18%. The authors also found significant heterogeneous effects from different
regions of the country.
    Although the evidences regarding the impact of Pronaf on rural households have found positive
effects on productivity, it also raised concerns about the correlation between the program and the pres-
ence of child labor in agricultural establishments. In this paper we propose to answer such questions
by studying whether the households benefited from Pronaf change their decisions of time allocation
between their members. We also address methodological issues present in the estimation of propen-
sity score models with complex surveys by using econometric methods recently suggested by the
specialized literature.

    Bolsa Familia was created in 2003 and it is the largest social development program in Brazil and one of the largest in
the world. Its objective is to promote assistance to families in extreme poverty through conditional cash transfers.

3. The National Program for the Strengthening of Family Farming
    The supply of rural credit for family farming in Brazil until the 1990s was reduced due to the
substantial presence of large landholdings in rural areas, which competed in the credit market with
small producers, as pointed out by Castro et al. (2014). Credit access to small producers began to
increase in 1995 with the creation of the National Program for the Strengthening of Family Farming
(Pronaf). The program targets family farmers and settlers of the agrarian reform, and the funding
can be used for the agroindustrial activity, the costing of the crop or for the investment in machinery,
equipment or infrastructure.
    Pronaf aims to stimulate income generation and enhance the use of family labor in rural establish-
ments or nearby community areas. In the year 2017, to be eligible for receiving credit from Pronaf,
the farmers must meet the following requirements: the annual gross income of the farmer should be
less than R$ 360 thousand; the number of permanent employees should be less than the number of
persons in the family; the family must reside near the productive establishment; and the size of the ru-
ral property must not exceed four fiscal modules, which varies across municipalities and corresponds
to the minimum area required for a rural property to be economically viable. There is also a specific
line of credit targeted to low income families (Pronaf Group B), which attends farmers with annual
income less than R$ 20 thousand.
    Pronaf was initially established by the Resolution no 2191 from the Central Bank of Brazil, issued
in August 1995, and later on reformulated by Presidential Decree no 1946 from June 1996. In the
initial year of operation, a total of R$ 650 million2 were financed, while in 2015/2016 around R$ 29
billion were made available in almost 2 million different contracts (MDA, 2015). The Ministry of
Agrarian Development (MDA) estimates that around 40% of Brazilian family farmers are attended by
the program, while Pronaf is present in 97% of the municipalities of Brazil. Over time, the program
has been modified to include different credit lines and to attend distinct profiles of rural families.
There is specific lines of credit for women, for young people, for logging activities, and for funding
and marketing of family agroindustries. Based on data from MDA, of the total volume of contracts,
48% was located in the southern region of the country, followed by 22% in the southeast region
and 14% in the northeast region. The average value financed in contracts signed by women was R$
7,432.35, while in contracts signed by men was R$ 15,157.97.
    Low interest rates constitute one of Pronaf’s main characteristics and it is central to the program’s
approach to strengthen family farming and to allow farmers with lower income to be able to access
credit. Interest rates vary according to the use of the credit and the amount financed. Over time
interest rates have been reduced. In 2015, the effective annual interest rate of credit for production
costs was 2.5% for values up to R$10,000.00, 4.5% for values from R$10,000.00 to R$30,000.00,
and 5.5% for values from R$30,000.00 to R$100,000.00. Since the inflation rate in 2015 was 10.67%
in Brazil (measured by IPCA), this financial contracts had negative real interest rates. The average
public financing interest rate for the agricultural sector in the 2014/2015 crop was 6.5% per year,
while in private institutions were 14.6% per year (BC, 2017).

4. Data and Method
    We evaluate the effect of receiving Pronaf on the time allocation of the members of the household
using data from the 2014 Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD), which is a national
representative cross-section household complex survey held by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estatística (IBGE) that gathers information on demographic and socio-economic characteristics of

Amplo), the inflation index officially used by the Brazilian Government.

all members of the households sampled. In the year 2014, this survey included a supplement about
productive inclusion programs such as Pronaf.
    Our initial sample includes 21,952 individuals who are in households that have at least one mem-
ber which: i) is self-employed or employer with at most five permanent employees in agricultural
activities; ii) either received credit from Pronaf or did not receive credit from other programs. There
are a total of 6,381 households and 6,742 families who meet these criteria. We selected this partic-
ular sample based on data availability, since the question about Pronaf was answered by agricultural
producers with at most five permanent employees - which may characterize family farming. Table 1
summarizes the characteristics of our sample, including the number of individuals in each role in the
family (head of family, partner, child and other member).

    In our regressions, the treatment variable is a dummy that indicates if someone in the household
received credit from Pronaf, while the dependent variables are related to the probability of work,
hours of work, domestic labor and school attendance. We also include many control variables for
individual, household, demographic and production characteristics, as well as dummies for different
family structures. Table 2 presents a full description of the variables used in our econometric models.

    Since PNAD is a cross-section complex survey, in order to perform a proper identification of the
impact of Pronaf, we apply propensity score methods using complex survey weights. The propensity
score is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. It
allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of
the particular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. Conditional on the propensity score,
the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated sub-
jects. In general, this method allows to compare two individuals, one in control group and another in

the treatment group, with very similar observable characteristics, such that the only factor that will
differentiate them will be the participation on the treatment.
    There are four previous papers, as far as we know, that addressed methodological issues in the use
of propensity score methods with complex surveys: Zanutto (2006), DuGoff et al. (2014), Ridgeway
et al. (2015) and Austin et al. (2016). According to DuGoff et al. (2014), combining a propensity
score method and survey weighting is necessary to achieve unbiased treatment effect estimates that
are generalizable to the original survey target population. In their study, they perform monte carlo
simulations where the minimum absolute bias on the estimation of the average treatment effect on the
treated were obtained when they used propensity score weighting with the weights from the propensity
score multiplied by the survey weights. In a recent study, Austin et al. (2016) criticized the limitation
of the monte carlo simulation of DuGoff et al. (2014). They simulated a more complex design,
recommending that when using propensity score matching with complex surveys the matched control
subjects should retain their complex sampling weights.
    In this paper we estimate three models for every dependent variable. The first model is a lin-
ear regression with complex survey weights (Survey-OLS). The second model is a propensity score
weighting using both weights from the logistic regression and from the complex survey (Survey-
PSW). In order to estimate this model we first run a logistic regression using the survey weights and
then we run a linear regression using the weights from the logistic regression multiplied by the sur-
vey weights. We use this method for the propensity score weighting based on the recommendations
of DuGoff et al. (2014). The third model is a propensity score matching using the survey weights
(Survey-PSM). In order to estimate this model we first run a nearest neighbour algorithm to match
treated and control and then we run a linear regression using the survey weights. This method is based
on the recommendations of Austin et al. (2016). We estimate these three models for different family
structures and different groups of individuals according to their role in the family. We also split all
the regressions by gender.
    One of the limitations of propensity score methods is the possibility of hidden biases due to un-
observable variables. In order to check the robustness of our results we perform a sensitivity analysis
based on the Rosenbaum bounds (Rosenbaum, 2002), which focus on the hidden biases from unob-
servable variables and therefore the violation of the assumption of random assignment of treatment
after matching through propensity scores. There is hidden bias when pairs look comparable in their
observable characteristics but differ in their actual probability of receiving the treatment. For con-
tinuous variables such as the hours of work and domestic labor, we apply the Rosenbaum bounds to
the Wilcoxon sign rank test, which is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used to check if the
difference between the outcomes of treated and control groups are significant after the matching. To
binary variables, such as the probability of working and the school attendance, we apply the Rosen-
baum bounds to the McNemar’s test, a commonly used statistical test to check if there are differences
on a dichotomous dependent variable between two related groups.
    Rosenbaum’s sensitivity analysis relies on the parameter Γ, which measures the degree of depar-
ture from random assignment of treatment. The idea is that two subjects with the same observed
characteristics may differ in the odds of receiving the treatment by at most a factor of Γ. In order
to check for the robustness of the difference between means of the outcomes for the treated and the
matched control groups, we calculate the Wilcoxon sign rank test p-values and McNemar’s test p-
values for different values of Γ and check how the test of the null hypothesis changes for increasing
values of Γ. The result shows high sensitivity to hidden bias if the conclusion of the test changes for
values of Γ just slightly higher than one, while it shows low sensitivity if the conclusions change only
with large values of Γ. We use upper and lower bounds on the p-values of these tests in order to check
how the conclusions of the test changes in the presence of bias due to unobserved confounders.

5. Results
    In order to evaluate the impact of Pronaf on the time allocation of individuals inside the households
we run several regressions including the three different models discussed in the last section (Survey-
OLS, Survey-PSW and Survey-PSM) for every dependent variable presented in Table 2. We also
estimate the regressions for different groups of individuals and family structures. In all tables of
results we split the regressions by gender and we omit the control variable coefficients for space
considerations.
    Table 3 presents the impact of Pronaf for all male heads of family and all female partners in
households that have at least one member which is self-employed or employer with at most five
permanent employees in agricultural activities.

    In Table 1 we can see that there are few households that received credit from Pronaf in which the
woman is the head of family or the man is the spouse/partner. For that reason we did not include
those individuals in the regressions of Table 3. We can also see that there is a total of 5,390 male
heads of family and 4,629 female partners in our sample, in which 552 males and 491 females are in
households that received credit from Pronaf. Notice that the Survey-PSM model, in columns 3 and 6
of Table 3, matches each treated unit with one control unit, such that we will have 1,104 observations
for male heads of family and 982 observations for female partners.
    The results of Table 3 indicate that Pronaf has a positive impact on the probability of working of
around 2.4 percentage points (pp) for men and 8.7 pp for women based on the Survey-PSM model.
The probability of performing rural activities also increases in 6.7 pp for men and 11.4 pp for women.
We considered three types of works in our regressions: paid word, unpaid work and work for own
consumption. While male heads of family increase the probability of paid work in 2.9 pp, female
partners increase the probability of unpaid work in almost 10 pp. Pronaf has a higher impact on the
probability of working for female partners, but they tend to engage in unpaid works that are related
with rural activities, which means they are probably helping the male heads of family in the main
productive activity that was benefited by the credit from Pronaf, rather than entering the labor market
independently.
    Table 3 also shows an increase in the hours of work in the main job and in all jobs of around 23%
for men and 39% for women. Notice that since our measure of hours of work is in logarithm and our
independent variable is a dummy, the percentage variation in the hours of work due to receiving credit
from Pronaf is obtained from exp(β) − 1, where β is the estimated coefficient. Also, the percentage
of increase in the hours of work is relative to the mean of all individuals in the sample, including the
ones that were not employed (or performing zero hours of work) at the time of the survey.
    These results show that Pronaf has a positive impact of increasing the focus on the main activity
for both men and women, but the effects are heterogeneous. Not only women increase their working
hours much more than men, but also their probability of working is higher than men. While men are
inserted in the labor market, women are engaging in unpaid works, probably helping the husband in
the agricultural activity.
    Our findings are in line with the evidence that Pronaf increases productivity of land and labor,
found by Garcias and Kassouf (2016), as well as the evidence that microcredit, in general, can increase
labor participation and generate extra income, although, as discussed by Haile et al. (2012), this can
help to perpetuate inequalities and reconfirm a gender-specific division of labor. The increased hours
of work for both men and women also suggest that households which received loans invest more in
their existing businesses, as found by Banerjee et al. (2015).
    We did not find significant effects on the probability of more than one job and in the hours of
domestic labor for both men and women, but there is a significant positive effect of around 7.3 pp
on the probability of performing domestic labor by male heads of family. This positive effect may
be a consequence of the female partners increasing their working hours and engaging in agricultural
activities, raising the need for men to perform domestic tasks.
    The balance tables for the control variables after the matching in the regressions of columns 3
and 6 of our Tables were omitted for space considerations, but there is no significant differences
between the mean of the treated and control groups after the matching. The nearest neighbor algorithm
perfectly balances the samples across the covariates.
    Table 4 shows the impact that Pronaf has on children from 10 to 17 years old. As discussed in
the literature review, the household’s access to rural credit may increase child labor, as reported by
Hazarika and Sarangi (2008) in rural Malawi and Islam and Choe (2013) in Bangladesh, which acts
as a channel through which rural households reduce their demand for their children’s schooling, as
discussed by Maldonado and González-Vega (2008) in Bolivia. In the case of Pronaf, we see evidence
of an increase in child labor for female adolescents, which is related to unpaid work in rural activities.

    Note: This table contains the estimation of the effect of Pronaf on the time allocation of all children from 10 to
    17 years in the sample characterized in Table 1. Control variables were omitted for space considerations. Values

    The results show an increase of around 12 pp in the probability of working for female adolescents,
while there is also an increase in almost the same magnitude in the probability of working in rural
activities and unpaid jobs. This supports the conclusion that female adolescents are helping the head
of the family in the agricultural activity that received credit from Pronaf. The program may have
adverse effects in terms of child labor.
    Policies that promote labor-intensive production, such as rural microcredit, may increase the sub-
stitution effect between child labor and school attendance, specially in developing countries in which
rural production is the comparative advantage (Ravallion and Wodon, 2000). While there is evi-
dence of a significant increase in the hours of work for female adolescents of more than 30%, there
is no significant negative effects on school attendance. In rural areas of developing countries, the
demand for schooling may also be influenced by many other determinants of human capital such as

health and nutrition, productivity gains and income transfers programs. The latter is very present
in Brazil, and is found to have significant positive effects on school attendance (Bourguignon et al.,
2003; Portela Souza and Cardoso, 2004; Cacciamali et al., 2010), which may help to mitigate some
adverse effects of microfinancing programs in child’s education.
    We have found no significant adverse effects of Pronaf on male adolescents. Since Table 4 consid-
ers all types of families, we further investigate the impact of Pronaf on different family structures and
found evidence of male child labor in certain types of families. We discuss these results on section 6.
    Table 5 shows the impact of Pronaf on other members of the family, which include sons, daughters
and other relatives with 18 years or more. We see a significant positive effect on the probability of
domestic labor and in the hours of domestic labor for women. Credit from Pronaf increases by 13 pp
the probability of other adult female members of the family perform domestic labor. The hours spent
in domestic tasks are also increased in around 58% (exp(β) − 1). There is also evidence of an increase
in the probability of rural activities and unpaid work for other female members.

    These results indicate that while female partners and female adolescents help the head of family
in the main agricultural activity, other adult female members of the family increase substantially the
hours spent in domestic tasks. This implies a division of labor based on the gender and the role of the
person in the family.
    In general, our results indicate that Pronaf has significant effects on the time allocation and the
gender-specific division of labor inside the households, what may bring some negative consequences
in terms of women empowerment. We also found adverse effects of Pronaf in terms of female child
labor. However, the program helps to increase productivity through an increased focus in the main
activities while not having the usual adverse effects of microcredit programs on school enrollment.
In the next section we discuss the evidences for different family structures and the sensitive analysis
based on the Rosenbaum bounds.

6. Family structures and sensitivity analysis
    We also performed regressions for specific types of family structures in order to check in more
detail the impact of Pronaf on the time allocation of the members of the family. We considered
married couples with and without children where the man is the head of the family. Table 6 shows the
impact of Pronaf on couples with children from 10 to 17 years in which the man is the head of family.
    When we look at this specific family structure, we also find significant effect of Pronaf on the
hours of work for couples and in the probability of paid work for men, while women are engaging in
unpaid work. Although the magnitude of the coefficients are similar than in the case of all types of
family structures, reported in Table 3, in this case we also find a decrease in paid work for women
of around 10 pp, which supports the fact that they are leaving paid jobs to help the male head of the
family in the main productive activity.
    Table 7 shows the effect of Pronaf only on the children of married couples where the man is
the head of the family. In this case, we found not only an increase in the hours of work and in the
probability of working for female adolescents, but also for male adolescents.
    While the impact of Pronaf on female adolescents for married couples are similar than in the
case of all types of family structures, the probability of male adolescents performing rural activities
and engaging in unpaid works increase in 19.7 pp and 14 pp, respectively. This result may reflect
the fact that male children from single mothers and other types of family where the head of family
performs agricultural activities are already working and assisting their parents. We can see that, once
we estimate the regression only for married couples, the adverse effect of Pronaf on male adolescents
is even higher than female adolescents. Although in both cases school attendance is not negatively
affected by Pronaf.
    We also consider the impact of Pronaf on couples with children younger than 10 years, older than
17 years or without children in Table 8. The results are also similar with the ones we have obtained
for other types of family. Female partners are increasing their probability of performing unpaid works
in around 8.7 pp. Both men and women are engaging in rural activities and increasing their hours of
work. As a consequence of the insertion of women in the labor market, men are also increasing their
probability of performing domestic tasks in around 10 pp.
    In general, when we look at different family structures, the results support the evidence that Pronaf
increases the hours of work of couples and the probability of female partners engage in unpaid work
and agricultural activities. But we also found evidence that not only female adolescents are perform-
ing child labor but also male adolescents in families with married couples. The balance tables for the
control variables after the matching in Tables 6 to 8 were omitted for space considerations, but there
is no significant differences between the mean of the treated and control groups after the matching.
    Since both groups are balanced after the matching, we reduce the selection bias due to observable
variables, but it is still possible to exist hidden biases from unobservable variables. In order to access

the existence of hidden biases we performed a sensitivity analysis for the Survey-PSM regressions
through the Rosenbaum bounds for the Wilcoxon sign rank test and the McNeman’s test, as discussed
in section 4. The Wilcoxon sign rank test is applied to continuous variables, such as the hours of work
and domestic labor, while the McNemar’s test is applied to binary variables such as the probability of
work and school attendance.
    For space considerations, we have omitted the results of the Rosenbaum bounds, but we found
that the sensitivity analysis supports the conclusions of a positive and significant effect of Pronaf on
the hours of work for couples and the probability of female partners engaging in agricultural activities
and unpaid works, as well as the adverse effect of child labor. Usually the results start to became
sensitive to hidden bias when we use gammas higher than 1.2. The heterogeneity of households and
the problem of self-selection are challenging for the evaluation of treatments in social programs. This
is particularly the case for rural credit programs such as Pronaf, which have voluntary participation
and heterogeneous outcomes. Econometric methods such as propensity score matching can help to
overcome these problems but observational studies in social sciences are usually highly sensitive to
hidden bias. For this reason, we used low increments in Γ to check robustness of the results when the
odds of receiving treatment differ.

7. Final remarks
    We have been discussing the effects of a rural credit program such as Pronaf on the time allocation
of the members inside the households. We have applied recent methods of propensity score using
complex surveys to perform estimations of the effect of this program in many variables related to the
labor market, domestic labor and school attendance for male heads of family, female partners, children
from 10 to 17 years and other members of the family. Pronaf has significant adverse effects on the
gender-specific division of labor and on child labor, but it also increases the focus in the agricultural
activity and it does not have a negative effect on school attendance.
    The results of this paper contribute to the literature about the effects of rural credit programs on
the time allocation of members inside the houlseholds by evaluating the most widely spread rural
development policy in Brazil. We also report novel results that indicate the existence of an adverse
effect of rural credit programs on woman’s independence in the labor market. These evidences urge
the need to increase the participation of women in credit-based income generation programs such as
Pronaf in order to strengthen the economic role of women in the family.
