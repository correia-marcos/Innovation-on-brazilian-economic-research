This paper explores for the first time the impact of a demand-driven training program on
labor turnover at both worker and firm level. Launched in 2014 by the Ministry of
Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC in Portuguese), Pronatec-MDIC allows firms to
demand courses and nominate some of their workers. Difference-in-difference estimates finds
that job tenure of workers that graduate from courses that their employers demand increases
by 6 months. Labor turnover within demanding firms varies when considering different
groups of workers who participate and did not participate in Pronatec-MDIC. These results
show that turnover is greater when considering turnover not related to job creation or
destruction (churning). This suggests that trained workers become more productive after the
course and can replace more non-trained workers, leading to higher productivity gains in the
short run. Results also suggest that firms that apply but do not have trained workers do not go
through this adjustment and see their turnover unchanged.

Esta pesquisa explora pela primeira vez o impacto de um programa de treinamento por
demanda sobre rotatividade em nível de trabalhador e firma. Lançado em 2014 pelo
Ministério de Desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio (MDIC), Pronatec-MDIC permite às
firmas demandar cursos e nominar trabalhadores. Estimadores de diferença-em-diferença
encontram que a duração de emprego dos trabalhadores que se formam dos cursos
demandados pelos seus empregadores aumenta por 6 meses. A rotatividade dentro das firmas
demandantes varia quando consideramos diferentes grupos de trabalhadores que participam
ou não no Pronatec-MDIC. Os resultados mostram que rotatividade é maior quando
consideramos rotatividade não relacionada a criação e destruição de emprego. Isso sugere que
trabalhadores treinados viram mais produtivos depois do curso e podem substituir mais
trabalhadores não treinados, criando ganhos na produtividade no curto prazo. Os resultados
também sugerem que as firmas que aplicam, mas que não tem trabalhadores treinados, não
passam por esse ajuste e não observam diferenças em suas rotatividades.

       I.      Introduction:

Two of the most marked features of the labor market in Brazil are its high job turnover and
stagnant labor productivity. Recent evidence shows that 49.5% of formal workers switched
jobs in 2013 (Corseuil et al., 2018b) and that labor productivity has been slowly growing at
1.1% per year in the past decade (IPEA, 2015). While there is widespread theoretical
recognition that skill enhancement within a firm affects turnover and labor productivity
(Arrow, 1962; Becker, 1993; ILO, 2010; BID, 2015), the literature is limited, to the best of our
knowledge, to the impact on labor turnover at worker level (Corseuil et al., 2018a).

The launch of the Programa Nacional de Ensino Técnico (Pronatec) in 2011, the supply-driven
training program of Brazil where participants choose the courses they wish to pursue, raised
expectations on the coverage of technical education. Theory suggests that as workers get
trained and stay longer, they accumulate experience, absorb firm-level knowledge, and become
more productive (Arrow, 1962; Becker, 1993). While no evaluations have assessed this
hypothesis, aggregated data available for the period after the introduction of the Pronatec shows
that the turnover rate from 2011 to 2013 dropped slightly from 53.7 % to 49.5% (Corseuil et
al., 2018b), but labor productivity decreased 0.6 p.p. from 2008-2010 to 2011-2013 (IPEA,
2015).

This paper tries to assess how skill enhancement and turnover are correlated at both worker
and firm level. We do so by assessing the impact of the demand-driven training version of
Pronatec launched in 2014 by the Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade (MDIC in
Portuguese). The Pronatec-MDIC version allows firms to demand courses some of their
workers take.

This study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and difference-in-differences
estimations to compare firms and workers that demand and participate in the training program
to those with similar characteristics who do not. To do so, we match administrative data of
applications of firms and workers for the 2014-2016 period to a longitudinal employer-
employee database for the 2012-2017 period5. The result is a comprehensive database that
enables us to track employment and firm dynamics before and after program application.

Initial evaluations of both supply- and demand-driven Pronatec are inconclusive. Barbosa et
al. (2016) compares workers dismissed in 2011 who complete the short-duration training (FIC)
courses between 2011 - 2013 with those who register but do not receive a confirmation. The
researchers find that workers who complete the supply-driven training do not present higher
employment probability or returns than those who do not get an application confirmation.

Conversely, Almeida et al. (2015) argues that the impact of training varies by provider, course
type and economic activity. The study employs PSM techniques to compare students who
complete various modalities of technical education with students who follow a general
education track. They find that students in courses privately managed and working in the
manufacturing sector earn higher wages than those who follow the general education track.
The launch of the demand-driven version of Pronatec in 2014 further promoted the debate.
Recent evidence of the program suggests that allowing employers to signal course demands
increases the probability of employment but do not induce wage gains considerably (O’Connel
et al., 2017). It also confirms that employment effects are more effective in skill-intensive

occupations like manufacturing. Despite these initial efforts to evaluate Pronatec, none of the
studies explores the turnover of workers.

Corseuil et al. (2018a) assess the impact of training on labor turnover but using the
apprenticeship law. Launched in 2000, the law provides tax breaks to firms that offer 2-year
contracts to young individuals age 14 to 24 while promoting in-class and on-the-job training.
They exploit a change in 2005 in the maximum age requirements (from 17 to 24) to evaluate
the impact on labor turnover. Using regression discontinuity, they find a reduction in the
turnover of workers who find their first job in large firms. However, they do not explore the
effect on firms and their analysis is restricted to young workers with no prior experience.

We instead look at labor turnover at worker and firm level to understand how turnover may
differ for workers, whether enrolled or not, and within firms, whether they apply to the program
or not. Our analysis is not immune to identification limitations. Individuals who apply to the
program might participate for reasons other than class cancellation or oversubscription,
arguably uncorrelated to their personal characteristics. The comparison of the characteristics
of these groups points to this direction. Additionally, at firm level, a protocol to select firms
whose course demands are approved does not seem to exist. Firms more likely to be selected
are, on average, large and may have an incentive to secure workers they invest in. To minimize
such limitations, we apply PSM to workers and firms and control for time and unit effects.

The paper is structured as follows. In the first two sessions we cover the regional and local
literature on the impact of skill enhancement on labor market outcomes, with a special focus
on labor turnover. In the third session we briefly describe the statistics of firms and workers
that apply to the program. In the fourth session we delved into the methodology and present
the results in the fifth one. Finally, we conclude and provide policy implications for Pronatec
and technical course design in Brazil.

   II.     Background of training programs

    A. Training in the region
The main conclusion arising from the literature is that supply-driven training programs yield
heterogeneous results (Card et al., 2010). In 1986, the U.S. Department of Labor created the
largest randomized evaluation of a supply-driven training, the Job Training Partnership Act
(Doolittle et al., 1993). This study spearheaded efforts to generate a credible estimate of what
would happen to beneficiaries receiving training in the absence of it. Its focus was to assess the
impact of training on two common labor market outcomes: employment and wages. In this
case, having access to the training increased the percentage of women employed by 2.1 p.p.
and that of men by 2.8 p.p. 18 months after the program finished. It also rose the 18-month
wages of adult women by 7.2 percent, but not that of adult men (Bloom et al., 1993).

In Latin America, randomized evaluations of hybrid programs have taken place in Colombia,
the Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Argentina. In Colombia, Attanasio et al. (2011) found
that participating in Jóvenes en Acción, a 3-month vocational training combined with a 3-month
apprenticeship, increases the probability of formal employment and higher wages in the short
term. A subsequent study shows that unemployed poor female workers aged 18 to 25 earn
sustained higher wages 10 years after the intervention. Program participation of men has
similar effects on employment but induces none on wages (Attanasio et al., 2015).




                                                                                                 2
In the Dominican Republic, benefiting from Juventud y Empleo, technical and vocational
courses followed by an internship, led to positive impact on wages but not on employment one
year after (Card et al., 2011). More recently, the program documents widening employability
gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries 6 years after graduating from the program but
did not find effects on overall employment (Ibarrarán et al., 2015). Moreover, male students
obtain an 8 p.p. increase in employment but no wage gains, while women saw no impact in
neither.

In line with these mixed results, a medium-term RCT of Entra21, a program in Cordoba,
Argentina which combines technical and life-skills training with internships, estimates
employment increases of 8 p.p. with wages being 40 percent higher than the control group 1.5
years after the program (Alzúa et al., 2015). However, the effects remain stable for men but
dissipate for women 3 years later. A study in Uruguay also estimates that participating in Yo
Estudio y Trabajo, a 1-year apprenticeship program in public enterprises, increases the
probability of finding a job 2 years after the program, but only for a specific age cohort (Araya
and Rivero, 2016). Students ages 18 or 19 who did not hold a formal job before were 9 p.p.
more likely to find employment.

In synthesis, supply-driven training programs combined with internships/apprenticeships may
yield positive employment effects. These effects seem to be mixed and vary by gender in the
short run while showing sustained impacts in the long run. Heterogeneous impacts may be the
results of program design. Some programs use training vouchers, which makes it difficult for
students to find training providers. Others complement training with work, turning difficult for
students to find a firm willing to offer a contract or balance the workload demand (J-PAL,
2017).

    B. Training in Brazil
Initial evaluations of supply-driven training focused on measuring the impact on employment
and wages. Evaluations of the National Plan of Professional Training (Planfor) and Education
of Youth and Adults (EJA) assessed the impact of supply-driven training on employment and
earnings (Musse and Machado, 2013; Firpo, Fogel, and Jales, 2014). Other researchers
assessed labor market outcomes such as the probability of (un)employment and its duration
(Paes de Barros et al., 2011; Neri, 2012) and potential earnings (Fernandes, Menezes-Filho e
Zylberstajn, 2000).

More recently, with the launch of Pronatec, also a supply-driven training program, some
evaluations have shed light on how the program affects labor reinsertion. Barbosa-Filho et al.
(2015) uses probit regression to estimate the reinsertion probability of workers who were
unemployed in 2011 and graduate from short-term (FIC) Pronatec courses. It finds that access
to training does not affect positively the employment probability of students who complete
training vis-à-vis those who register but do not receive enrollment confirmation.

Unlike supply-driven training, demand-driven training adjusts to the needs of trainees. It allows
beneficiaries to select the training they wish to pursue and even select providers that better
suites them. The few evaluations which have explored the effect of demand-driven training in
Brazil, have also assessed employment probability and earnings. O’Connel et al. (2017)
exploits the program design of Pronatec-MDIC, which leaves out for administrative reasons
workers who register for training. Employing a difference-in-differences instrumental variable
strategy, the study finds that participating increases the probability of employment by 2 to 3
percent points in the year after program completion without affecting earnings.


                                                                                                3
That said, the literature on the impact of demand-driven training on labor turnover is limited to
Corseuil et al. (2018a). The authors exploit a change in the age eligibility of the Apprenticeship
Law6. The law states that firms can hire young workers under an apprenticeship contract and
indicate which intensive in-classroom courses they should take in exchange of payroll
subsidies.

Using partially fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) and adjusted matching method,
the authors find that demand-driven training decreases turnover in the short and medium term.
After controlling for determinants of program participation, the number of admissions was
16.7% lower than temporary contracts 2-3 years after and 20.6% lower 4-5 years later.
Similarly, dismissals decrease by 37.9% after 2-3 years and by 20.9% after 3-5 years.

Evidence of whether Pronatec beneficiaries switch jobs quick is non-existent to the best of our
knowledge. This paper thus intends to fill this gap by assessing the impact of Pronatec-MDIC
on job turnover.

    C. Training models
Models of job turnover claim that turnover does not necessarily generate bad outcomes
according to Jovanovic (1979a, 1979b). It can either improve job matching as information
about the job and the candidate is revealed in the first months after placement. Or it can worsen
the possibility of accumulating human capital unavailable in classrooms such as firm-specific
and non-cognitive skills.

On the other hand, models of productivity also assert that the more a worker produces (Arrow,
1962) and the more qualified the worker is (Becker, 1962), the more experience it obtains and
the more efficient it becomes at producing its tasks. Both theories suggest that productivity is
a function of learning over time. Firms with higher levels of turnover may compromise the
learning accumulation of their workers and their productivity as a consequence. The reason
may be that high turnover is associated with low levels of commitment and training, from both
the workers’ and firms’ side.

Stylized facts suggest turnover is high in Brazil compared to international standards (Corseuil
et. al., 2002; Gonzaga, 2003). Corseuil et al. (2014) finds that turnover 7 is especially high for
young workers compared to their adult peers. High youth turnover is concentrated in younger
workers (ages 18 - 24) with low schooling (up to lower secondary school) who earn low wages,
which makes them easily substitutable.

We also know that youth turnover is not explained by the proportion of young workers entering
short-term contracts but by dismissals associated with replacement for other young workers.
On one hand, the percentage of young workers hired through temporary contracts did not reach
more than 16% between 1996 and 2010 compared to 43% in European countries (O’Higgins,
2012). Although this phenomenon may be changing. On the other hand, 68.6% of the turnover
rate8 in 2014 stems from separations due to firm decisions. In fact, the proportion of young

became eligible.
7 Measured as the difference between hirings and separations in a given year divided by the number of workers active at the end of the

year.
8 Measured as the smallest amount between admitted and dismissed workers divided by the number of workers active at the end of a

given year under the regime of the consolidation of the labor laws (CLT by its initials in Portuguese). The rates exclude those dismissals



                                                                                                                                             4
workers’ separations due to substitutions for workers of the same age group was 65% in 2010,
and it has grown 12 percent points since 1996 (Corseuil et al., 2013).

These facts may imply that, if firms invest in their employees, they may have fewer incentives
to dismiss them and replace them for other workers, allowing them to stay longer. However,
the opposite can be true. A recent paper by Rasul et al. (2017) demonstrates that demand-driven
vocational training for youth induces higher rates of job-to-job offers, leading to greater worker
turnover. The certifiability and transferability of the skills accumulated lead to matches with
high productivity firms. Therefore, whether investing in training of workers diminish turnover
is an empirical question that we try to answer in this quasi-experimental study that focuses on
the job tenure of all workers and labor turnover of firms.

     III.       Data and descriptive statistics

We use administrative data of Pronatec-MDIC course applications for the years 2014-2016.
We use this information to retrieve course application, acceptance and rejection proportions as
well as dropout and graduation rates. We then match the data with employment records of firms
using the Annual Report of Social Information (RAIS in Portuguese) for 2011-2017. The
matched data allow us to obtain the employment status and characteristics of workers (enrolled
in Pronatec-MDIC or not) who are employed by the firms that demand the Pronatec-MDIC
course.

The first part of the data is from Pronatec-MDIC. Pronatec was established in 2011 to promote
the inclusion of vulnerable groups in vocational and technical education. The MDIC version
of Pronatec was then launched in 2014 to align course supply to the demand of firms in the
manufacturing, trade, and service industries. As summarized in annex I, the program protocol
involves several steps, from the moment firms and students apply for the program separately
to the moment students graduate from the courses.

Firms submit course demands and report their tax ID, the course ID, the municipality where
the course takes place, the number of people the companies wish to train, and in some cases,
the occupations they demand this course for. As observed in table 1, 5,618 firms demand
courses between 2014 and 2016. Around 4,300 firms submit applications in at least one year;
1,000 in two years; and less than 200 in at least 3 years.

The Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade filters course demands based on relevance
and necessity. Demands for English courses or with high numbers of vacancies are rejected.
About half of the demands are filtered out in this stage (O’Connel et al., 2017). MDIC then
submits the demands to the Ministry of Education (MEC) which compiles the demands from
other ministries and approves them based on budget and complementarity. Similar course
demands from ministries, for example, are aggregated and approved. As summarized in table

that occur for reasons related to death, retirement, job transition and upon the worker’s request as a means to approximate turnover
related to decisions of firms.

Once all courses are approved, MEC opens course registration and subsequent enrollment for
students. Table 3 shows that between 2014 and 2016, 55,762 students register at least once for
the program, but only 76.69% receive enrollment confirmation in their first attempt. Of those
who receive an enrollment confirmation, 64.45% graduate and 25.37% drop out. Of those who
do not receive a confirmation, 12.58% were not admitted for administrative reasons (class
cancellation and oversubscription) as observed in table 4.

The Pronatec-MDIC dataset is complemented by the RAIS 2011-2017. The RAIS is an annual
administrative dataset that contains data on employment and earnings of all the formally-
employed workers of formally-registered firms. The RAIS includes detailed information on the
employer and the employee (including their tax IDs), and their work relationship (wage, tenure,
type of employment, hiring and dismissal date, and reason for dismissal).

In the RAIS, we were able to match the information of 84.16% of firms that make a course
request at least once between 2014-2016 and 65.75% of students that which apply to the
program at least once between the same timeframe. Unmatched student data in the RAIS could
occur because the student was not formally employed within the 2011-2017 period. Combining
both datasets allows us to trace the employment history of students before and after program
registration, enrollment and graduation, including their turnover rates.

Unlike O’Connel et al. (2017), we manage to match the class that the firm demands to the class
the student is registered in using a unique class ID for 2015-2016. From the pool of students
registered in these course, we filtered their first applications and whether they are employed by
the demanding firm and enrolled at the time the course starts. We also filtered out those who
had two simultaneous jobs.

Table 5 shows that of the 17,514 registered for firm-requested courses, 7,531 are employed at
course onset. Of those employed, 5,824 are working for the firm that requested the course. And
of those employed in the requesting firm, 3,497 are also enrolled in the requested courses. Out
of those enrolled, 2,478 graduate and of those not enrolled, 55 were rejected due to
administrative reasons. Finally, those working for requesting firms and enrolled in the
requested courses stay, on average, employed for 22.62 months from the moment the course
starts. On the other hand, those employed by the requesting firm but who did not get the course
for administrative reasons remain employed for 13 months from course onset.

     IV.      Methodology

We wish to measure the impact of firm application and nomination for course enrollment on
job tenure and labor turnover. To do so, we split the methodology at employee and firm level.

     A. Worker level

In the case of employees, we wish to measure the impact that being nominated by the firm to
participate and graduate from a firm-demanded course has on job tenure. Ideally, we would
use administrative constraints as an exogenous source of variation for understanding the impact
of the program on employees. That is, use as counterfactual the employees that apply to courses
demanded by the firms, but who are denied access for reasons unrelated to their characteristics.

However, there is no nomination protocol and the characteristics of employees rejected for
administrative reasons are not similar to that of the treatment group, in part because there are
few employees that fulfill these conditions (table 6). To construct a credible comparison group
of workers with similar characteristics to minimize a potential self-selection issue, the study
uses Propensity Score Matching (PSM) (Heckman et al., 1997).

We match the probability of program enrollment of workers employed by demanding firms
while enrolled in courses in 2015-16 with that of workers employed by demanding firms with
similar characteristics who do not participate in the program. The matching is built on a logit
model that captures the likelihood that an employee is assigned to treatment, based on its pre-
treatment characteristics such as age, gender, race, location, education level, job tenure, annual
average wage, number of registrations, and enrollment attempts. The match produces treatment
and comparison groups that share similar characteristics (annex II.A.). Both control and
treatment groups are then assigned to strata according to its propensity score and the Kernel
regression estimator chooses the weights so that the closest observations receive greater weight
(figure 1).

We then follow the job tenure of workers until 2017. To estimate job tenure, we calculate the
duration of employment from the moment the course finishes to the moment of the dismissal
or last day of 2017. To estimate the difference in job tenure for workers who enroll or graduate
and those who do not, we estimate the following specification:

     𝑦𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ⋅ 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑗 + 𝛾 ⋅ 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿 ⋅ 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑗 ∗ 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃 ⋅ 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡

Where 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 is employment duration after the course starts; 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑗 are year-month dummies
indicating whether the worker enrolls into, or graduate from, the program; and 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 accounts
for the follow-up period. In other words, each control and treatment unit have one observation
before and one after the course. We hypothesize that while enrollment may have a capital
accumulation effect on job tenure, graduation may have a further signaling effect. Finally, we
control for age, sex, race, location, educational level, occupation, the firm’s industry, job tenure
before and number of registrations (𝑋𝑖𝑡 ) and cluster the error at state level 𝜑𝑖 . We are interested
on the 𝛿 coefficient, which indicates the causal impact of participating in Pronatec on job
tenure.

    B. Firm level

In the case of firms, we wish to measure the impact that firm application has on turnover. To
compensate for the lack of an application protocol, we create a comparison group of firms. We
do that by using PSM. We match the probability of course approval of firms that obtain training
for their workers with that of firms that do not but have similar characteristics. The matching
is built on a logit model that captures the likelihood that firm is assigned to treatment based on
its pre-treatment features such the as age, gender, race, job tenure, wage and registration and
enrollment attempts of workers, and the location, economic activity and size of the firm. To
maximize the quality of the match, we identify treatment and comparison groups that have
similar characteristics (annex II.B.) and use a Kernel regression (figure 2).

We then follow the labor turnover of firms from 2011 until 2017, for which we calculate two
different rates for each establishment i at the end of year t:

                                                              𝐻𝑖𝑡+𝑆𝑖𝑡
                                                 𝑅1𝑖𝑡 = (               )
                                                               𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡
                                                 𝐻𝑖𝑡+𝑆𝑖𝑡                    𝐻𝑖𝑡−𝑆𝑖𝑡
                                    𝑅2𝑖𝑡 = (               ) − 𝑎𝑏𝑠 |(                 )|
                                                  𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡                       𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡
Where;
         𝐻𝑖𝑡 = admissions in firm 𝑖 at time 𝑡
         𝑆𝑖𝑡 = separations in firm 𝑖 at time 𝑡
                  (𝐸 +𝐸      )
         𝐴𝐸𝑖𝑡 = 𝑖𝑒𝑡 2 𝑖𝑒𝑡−1 ; is the average number of workers between two consecutive
         periods in establishment i at time t
         𝑅1𝑖𝑡 = is the job flow or the rate at which workers enter and leave a firm i at the end
         of time t (Corseuil et al., 2013)
         𝑅2𝑖𝑡 = is the churning rate or the rate at which workers enter and leave a firm not
         because job creation or destruction (Corseuil et al., 2013)

In other words, while the two job turnover rates consider the flow of admissions and/or
separations over the average stock of workers between two consecutive years, 𝑅1𝑖𝑡 focuses on
the overall flow of workers while 𝑅2𝑖𝑡 takes on the flow not caused by job creation/destruction.
To estimate the difference in job tenure of firms which experience the treatment and those not
exposed to it, we estimate the following regression:

    𝑦𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 ⋅ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖 + 𝛾 ⋅ 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿 ⋅ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐 ∗ 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃 ⋅ 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜑𝑖 + 𝜎𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡
Where 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 is job turnover after the first application to the program; 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑖 is a year-month
dummy indicating whether the firm participates in the program and 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 accounts for the
follow-up period. In other words, each control and treatment unit have one observation before
and one after the course. Finally, 𝜑𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜎𝑡 are a full set of firm and time effects that accounts
for the potential impact that covariate and idiosyncratic shocks may have on job turnover.

We then control for the average age, sex, race, educational level, occupation, job tenure, wage
and registration rate of the workers within the firm as well as the location, economic activity


                                                                                                      10
and size of the firm. We also control for the number of attempts a worker makes to pursue a
course as a proxy for will to thrive which is unobservable. We are interested on the
𝛿 coefficient, which indicates the causal impact of participating in Pronatec on job turnover.

We find evidence that workers who enroll stay on average 7 months longer than workers of the
same firm who do not enroll in a training course. The result (table 7) is significant at 95%.

Graduation
Similarly, we find evidence that workers who graduate stay on average 6.3 months longer than
workers of the same firm who do not graduate. These results are consistent with the human
capital (Becker 1962, 1993) and job market signaling (Spence, 1973) models. On one hand,
the 7 months differential between enrolled and non-enrolled workers suggests that investing in
training that is applied on the job enhances capital accumulation and induces experience. That
is, doing the course makes workers accumulate skills, become more productive and thus stay
longer as they gain experience.

Furthermore, graduating from the course can also send a signal to the employer beyond capital
accumulation. Finalizing the course can indicate the employer that the worker has diligently
completed the course requirements, acquired the most amount of competences possible and
thus inducing an extra 6.3 months of job tenure compared to non-enrolled peers.

   B. Firm level
At firm level, we find mixed results. The findings are presented for two types of job turnover
rates (job flow and churning) and groups (all workers, Pronatec applicants and non-applicants).
In general terms, we find evidence that having courses approved increases the labor turnover
of firms when using data for all workers and Pronatec applicants.
More specifically, overall labor turnover (R1) for treated firms increases by 0.046 and 0.23
when accounted for all workers and Pronatec applicants, respectively (table 9). That is, for
every 20 workers employed within two consecutive periods after the intervention, 1 and 5
workers are either hired or dismissed. In the same line, having course approved increases the
labor turnover rate not associated with job creation and destruction (R2) by 0.025 and 0.226
points for firms when considering all workers and Pronatec-applicants, respectively (table 9).
When considering workers who do not apply, turnover decreases but the effect is not
significant. We show the results of the minimum turnover (R3) in annex III.

The adjustment in turnover is not immediate and decreases over time. In the first year after the
course demand, the labor turnover of trained and non-trained workers does not change. Then
the second year, when the adjustment occurs, turnover increases more for trainees (0.090 (R1)
and 0.137 (R2)) than non-trainees (0.063 (R1) and 0.058 (R2)). However, with time, the
turnover decreases in the third year more substantially for trainees (-0.203 (R1) and -0.263
(R2)) than non-trainees (-0.034 (R1) and -0.051 (R2)). Put differently, qualified workers switch
jobs more in the non-immediate short run than non-trainees but revert the process more in the
medium run.

The greater turnover for trained workers in the second year might be associated with more
productive workers leaving firms increasing productivity in the hiring firms. The reduction in
turnover for trained workers in the third year might be associated with a firm retaining more
qualified workers. If these findings were hold true, we would expect to observe the turnover
effect to dissipate completely over time as firms adjust to normal after taking advantage of the
productivity gain, a hypothesis we would be able to test with a longer timeframe.
       VI.        Conclusion and policy implications
The labor market in Brazil has been characterized for high labor turnover and stagnant worker
productivity. The launch of Pronatec in 2011, a supply-driven training program where
participants choose the courses they wish to pursue, raised expectations on whether capital
accumulation could diminish labor turnover and increase productivity. The launch of a
demand-driven version of Pronatec in 2014 by the Ministry of Development, Industry and
Trade, where firms could demand courses some of their workers could take, further the debate.
This paper explores for the first time the impact of a demand-driven training program on labor
turnover at both worker and firm level. It finds that while job tenure of workers that enroll and
graduate from courses that their employers demand increases by 7 and 6 months respectively,
the labor turnover of demanding firms increases between 0.20 and 0.05 points. That is, for
every 20 workers hired in two consecutive periods after the intervention, between 1 and 4
workers are admitted or separated. These results seem to dissipate overtime.
These findings may suggest that turnover is in fact induced by qualification as opposed to job
creation or destruction and that participating larger firms make stronger adjustments. These
firms may nominate their best workers to the courses, making them more qualified and capable
of performing the job of one or more non-trained workers, leading to higher productivity gains
and worker substitution. The adjustment is not immediate though and may converge overtime.
Turnover only increases the second year after the course demand but decreases a year later,
suggesting that it takes time for the effect of training to kick in and reverts with time.

The policy implications of these results are that large scale training programs in Brazil need
reform as workers may be trapped in a vicious cycle in which high turnover disincentivizes
education and training even when offered for free. Thus, when training demanded by their
employees results in higher job duration within that firm, workers can be more motivated to
invest and break this vicious cycle. The fact that only one Ministry employs this demand-driven
design out of 21 eligible Ministries provides an opportunity to switch to a demand-driven
training model to improve labor turnover in the long run9, a phenomenon that may be holding
back the labor productivity potential of firms in the country. Also, this supply-driven programs
spent BRL 2.4 billion annually in 201510 while demand-driven programs can be more cost-
effective.



9 It is paramount to understand that some supply-driven programs have social objectivities where this statement may not apply like re-
insertion of former convicts, insured workers, among others.
