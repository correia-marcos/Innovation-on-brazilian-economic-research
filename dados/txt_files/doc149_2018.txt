Abstract: In this study we aim to identify and measure the external returns to human capital in Brazil
using information from the Ministry of Labor’s Annual Social Information Report (RAIS) on all urban
agglomeration in the country for the period 2002-2014. With a two step estimation and using instrumental
variables for identification we find a considerable effect of local human capital concentration on local wages.
The set of results indicates that, in the case of brazilian labor market areas, the external returns to human
capital are a 0.86% increase in local wages for an increase of one percentage point in college graduates.
Consistent with theoretical expectations and similar to literature results, we also found that the impact of
local human capital is stronger for unskilled than for skilled workers. Finally, results are robust and not
equally distributed across sectors

1      Introduction
The relation between individual human capital and earnings are quite known. Most of the empirical work
confirms the intuitive notion that wage gains are in fact related to education attainment and not just to
unobservable worker characteristics, leaving little doubt about the impact that education has on the private
sphere. On the other hand, the relationship between concentration of local human capital in individual
earnings are less known, despite human capital externalities being at the core of both theoretical models
and justifications for education provision through public policies.
          In this context, we can ask ourselfs what externalities would arise with the educational level of a
given place and what would be their net effect. Answering this question matters to support the education
subsidies and local development policies associated with the provision of education attaiment, since in the
case of positive externalities the gains would not be limited to individuals but also present at the social level
through educational spillovers. Despite the importance of this research agenda, empirical works with this
specific goal are more recent and relatively scarce.
          Among theoretical explanation for the existence of human capital externalities found in the lite-
rature, we have Rauch (1993)’s argument that knowledge and skills are shared between workers in formal
and informal interactions, with higher level of human capital of individuals increasing probability that mea-
ningful knowledge is shared when individual agents meet1 . Additionally, Glaeser (1999) argues that larger
cities, in addition to the possible existence of more formal education sources and specific training pro-
grams, would also offer unique opportunities through a non formal learning environment through social
and business contacts, and therefore, would also benefit ordinary workers through the imitation of more
skillful neighbors, leading to widespread impacts of human capital concentration and not just focused on
innovation.
          Acemoglu & Angrist (2001) divide theoretical arguments into two types, pecuniary and non-
pecuniary. The first type are those that manifest themselves through interactions and sharing of knowledge
and ideas in the lines of Jacobs externalities, due to Jacobs (1970) argument that cities are the main engine
of growth because they facilitate exchange of ideas. The pecuniary ones, are in lines with Marshalian ex-
ternalities, with the argument that increasing the geographic concentration of specialized inputs increases
productivity, since the matching between factor inputs and industries is improved. Moretti (2004a) calls the
human capital externalities of productive externalities, which occur when the presence of skilled workers
makes other more productive workers so that an increase in aggregate human capital generates an effect on
aggregate productivity.
          Despite the clear mechanisms postulated by economic theory to explain external effects of human
capital concentration, empirical estimation allways faced difficulties. The most important ones are mainly
related to bias introduced by unobservable factors correlated with wages on one hand, and human capital
concentration on the other. The first source of bias is the existence of sorting, the concentration of indi-
viduals of high levels of unobserved ability into cities. On the local level, a second problem is the bias
introduced by city-specific unobserved characteristics that are correlated with human capital concentration.
As suggested by Moretti (2004a), some examples are, unobserved differences in industrial mix, technology
or natural resources. The empirical literature tries to control for these problems with, panel data for worker
fixed effect, introduction of labor shock controls, and instrumental variables respectively.
          However, only throughout recent years improvements in access to worker-level information fo-
mented a rise in studies focused on wage disparities across regions which implements these estimation
strategies. This allowed the emergence of research focused on corectly identify and measure of aglome-
ration and huma capital concentration effects (Moretti, 2004a,b; Combes et al. , 2008, 2010; Heuermann,
2011; Groot et al. , 2014; Broersma et al. , 2015; Barufi et al. , 2016). Empirical findings for develop
countries shows that externalities due to human capital concentration are large and also affect unskilled
workers. For the U.S estimates range from a 1% to 5% wage increase for a one year increase in local
average scholling (Rauch, 1993; Acemoglu & Angrist, 2001). For West Germany, results are 1.8% and
0.6% (Heuermann, 2011). Unfortunately, research for developing countries is scarcer. Liu (2007), which
following the empirical strategy of Moretti (2004a), assess the external returns to education in China. For
Kenya, Manda et al. (2002) uses district-level average education attaiment to capture the effect of human
capital on earnings, finding positive effects for male and female workers. Thus, there is a gap to be filled

in the research program on the effects of human capital concentration, namely, increase evidence of human
capital agglomeration in developing countries.
           Specifically for Brazil, some facts can be considered stylized in the context of human capital. The
first is the existence of high private return of education, ranging from 9.8 % to 18 % depending on the
methodology used (Sachsida et al. , 2004; Barbosa Filho & Pessoa, 2008), secondly is the large regional
wage inequality related to a inequalities in regional education attaiment (Barros et al. , 2007). In fact, the
country has historically low human capital stock and presents a stagnation of labor productivity (Galeano
& Feijó, 2013). In this setup the assessement of external effects of human capital is especially important
because identify social returns to human capital concentration would serve as yet another argument to
promote policies that aim human capital increase within the labor force. Despite those facts, studies with
the specific goal of identifing external returns of human capital concentration are not numerous, some
exceptions are Araujo Junior & Silveira Neto (2004) and Falcão & Silveira Neto (2007), however these
initial studies do not fully address bias issues. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to identify and
measure external returns to human capital concentration on local wages in Brazil.
           Specific contributions of the paper are twofold. First, despite the high known private returns of
human capital in Brazil, the external effects are still unknown. We help to fill that gap in the national
and developing countries literature by assessing evidence of human capital externalities. Second, although
we focus on the effect of human capital concentration on local wages, we simultaneously include local
employment density in our estimations. This inclusion is important to control for what Combes et al.
(2010) calls “endogenous labor quantity”, that is, more productive places and therefore with higher wages,
can attract more skilled and unskilled workers becoming denser, which may affect the correct estimates of
the effect of interest by, possibly, changing local workforce composition.
           Our results indicate that, for Brazilian labor market areas, the effect of human capital concentration,
defined by the fraction of individuals with at least a college degree, in local wages is about 0.839, that is, a
one percentage point in the concentration o college graduates increases local wages by about 0.84%. Also
the effect is larger than purely agglomeration effects arising from population density only. Furthermore, the
effect is higher for unskilled workers then for skilled and are not equally distributed across sectors, with
returns concentrated in the manufacturing and service sectors. Results were robust to different specifications
and estimation strategies.
           The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a theoretical fra-
mework. Section 4 describes the empirical strategy and the treatment of the underlying data. Section 5
presents and analyzes the results and robustness checks, with the conclusions being presented in the last
section.


2    Previous Empirical Evidence
The formalization of the impacts of productivity gains from education (human capital) in the per capita
production growth are laid out in Lucas (1988), with it’s endogenous growth model based of heteroge-
nous human capital distribution between workers as the main explanation from the cross-country incomes
differences. However, The first paper to exploit differences in human capital across cities to identify exter-
nalities was Rauch (1993). Using the cross sectional data from the 1980 US Census he found that a one
year increase in average education raises wages by 3% to 5% percent in 1980. As point out by Moretti
(2004a), Rauch’s paper suffers from two methodology limitation, first is that he does not directly account
for the endogeneity of aggregate human capital and, second, he does not distinguish between externalities
and complementarity between skilled and unskilled workers.
          In order to circunvey these estimation problems, Acemoglu & Angrist (2001) uses variations in
compulsory education laws and the birth quarter of individuals as an instrumental variable for secondary
schooling in a panel fix effects of U.S. states, finding smaller external returns to education, between 1%
and 3%. However, the authors themselves argue that variations in compulsory scholling laws would affect
mainly secondary education. Ciccone & Peri (2002) argue that studies with a Mincerian approach that
try to identify human capital externalites with a standard Micerian wage regression, such as the previous
cited ones, may confound positive externalities with wage changes arising from a negatively inclined de-
mand curve for human capital. The authors propose to use a new approach holding the labour force skill
composition constant, not finding significant externalities for cities and states between 1970 and 1990.

         Focusing on college level education, Moretti (2004a,b), using a panel data, estimate a model of
non-random selection of workers among cities, accounting for unobservable city-specifc demand shocks by
using two instrumental variables for human capital concentration, namely, lagged demographic scholling
structure of the city and the existence of a land-grant college. He finds that a percentage point increase in
the supply of college graduates raises high school drop-outs’ wages by 1.9%, high school graduates’ wages
by 1.6%, and college graduates wages by 0.4%. Focusing on wage inequality across US metro regions,
Florida & Mellander (2014) find that regional variation in wage inequality, on the one hand, is associated
with human capital, skill levels and occupational structure, in line with previous studies of skill-biased
change and job polarization.
         Considering the evidence for European urban centers, Heuermann (2011) using panel data and em-
ploying instrumental variables estimate human capital externalities for highly and non-highly educational
groups and different sectors. Although the authors finds high a positive and significant effect, on contrary to
Moretti (2004a), the effect is larger for the highly educated group, a 1.8% increase in the high skilled wage
group and 0.6% for the non-highly educated. Also, the effects are larger in the manufacturing sector than in
the service sector. More recently, Broersma et al. (2015), analyzes the effect of human capital externalities
specifically for low-educated workers and for jobs with low skill requirements, using a employer-employee
matched dataset for Dutch workers. Through a mincerian estimation in a multilevel model approach, inclu-
ding regional level data, the authors find that, workers on low-skilled jobs earn higher wages when working
in cooperation with workers in high-skilled jobs, while for low-educated workers such cooperation with
high-educated workers is negative. In a cross-country analysis of productivity in five OECD countries
(Germany, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States), Ahrend et al. (2014) uses a two-step eco-
nometric approach that enable to capture the productivity clean for individual unobserved heterogenity and
sorting of more productive individuals into cities. The autors find that city productivity premiums tend to
increase with city size. Specifically, a twofold increase in city size is associated with a 2-5% increase in
productivity.
         For developing Countries the lirature is scarcer. Liu (2007), follows the empirical strategy of
Moretti (2004a) for assessing the external returns to education in China. He finds that the external returns
are at least as high as the private returns to education, ranging from a low of 4.9% to a high of 6.7%.
Two-stage least squares estimates indicate that a one-year increase in city average education could increase
individual earnings by between 11 and 13%, and social returns can be as high as 16%. A significantly
higher return than those found in developed countries. For Kenya, Manda et al. (2002) uses a Mincerian
equation approach with district-level average education attaiment to capture the effect of human capital on
monthly earnings, finding positive effects for male and female workers. More interestings, an increase in
average human capital for females has a positive impact on earnings of male workers relative to female
workers.
         Specifically for Brazil, most papers focus on the role of density through an agglomeration eco-
nomies approach such as Rocha et al. (2011) and more recently, Barufi et al. (2016) analyzes the effect
of sector-specific agglomeration economies. They find that urbanisation economies positively and signi-
ficantly affect the manufacturing and servive sectors, with impact of populationd density in local wages
ranging from 5.1% to 9.4%. Despite the scarce literature some exceptions can be found, early works have
studied the impact of human capital concentration on wages (Araujo Junior & Silveira Neto, 2004; Falcão
& Silveira Neto, 2007), however these initial studies do not address bias issues.


3    Theoretical Framework
In order to estimate the effect of human capital concentration on productivity (trought wages), we must first
present a theorical model. We use a simple framework proposed by Moretti (2004a) based on the general
equilibrium model of Roback (1980, 1982). In this proposed theoretical framework the identification of ex-
ternalities generated by the concentration of human capital, considers the imperfect substitution by different
types of workers, skilled and unskilled. Considering, like Heuermann (2011), that the production function
of the Cobb-Douglas type depends on two inputs, skilled and unskilled workers, we have to:

                                Yj = (θ1j N1j )α (θ2j N2j )1−α ,   α ∈ (0, 1)                              (1)
where N1j quantifies the total number of skilled workers in municipality j and N2j the same measure for


                                                      4
unskilled workers, with productivity mesured by θ1j and θ2j respectively. However, we use a more general
and flexible functional that relates productivity and the share of skilled workers in region j (sj ), specifically:

                                     log(θij ) = φij + fi (sj , γ),      i = 1, 2                              (2)
Where fi (sj , γ) associates the productivity of each worker to the portion of skilled workers, and a positive
parameter . Therefore, equation (2) indicates that the productivity of worker i in the municipality j depends
on its own level of human capital, but also on the local stock of human capital of the locality j that must
act by increasing the productivity of both workers positively. However, if the externalities generated by
the concentration of human capital are not correlated with the productivity of the workers, it should be
equal to zero. The generalization made by equation (2) is important because, unlike Moretti (2004a) and
Heuermann (2011), the effects associated with human capital extrenalities does not necessarily act with
equal intensity for both types of workers. Therefore, as seen bellow, with the generalization it is possible to
have differentiated gains according to different levels of workers schooling.
         Equating the wage of each type of worker to the marginal product of labor from the production
function specified by equation (1), using equation (2) and sj = N1j /N1j + N2j It follows:


                 log(w1j ) = log(α1 ) + α1 log(θ1j ) + (α − 1) log(sj ) + (1 − α1 ) log(θ2j )                  (3)
                           + (1 − α1 ) log(1 − sj )



               log(w2j ) = log(1 − α1 ) + α1 log(θ1j ) + (α − 1) log(sj ) + (1 − α1 ) log(θ2j )                (4)
                         + (α1 ) log(1 − sj )

          By deriving equations (3) and (4) for region j as a function of the share of skilled workers, the
impact of a marginal increase in the number of skilled workers on the salary of both workers is obtained as
follows :

                                      d log(w1j )    0             α−1
                                                  = f1 (sj , γ) +          ,                                   (5)
                                          dsj                     sj − s2j
                                      d log(w2j )    0               α
                                                  = f2 (sj , γ) +          .                                   (6)
                                          dsj                     sj − s2j
        Skilled workers will benefit the most by higher wages, by taking advantage of the externalities
generated by the concentration of human capital if the following condition is observed:
                                         0            0                  1
                                       f1 (sj , γ) > f2 (sj , γ) +                                             (7)
                                                                      sj − s2j
           Here two consideration must be made. According to expression (7), a marginal increase in the
stock of human capital in a given region will have a greater positive effect on skilled workers wages than
                             0
of unskilled workers if f1 (sj , γ) the "externality effect"overcome the wage gains of unskilled workers
  0
f2 (sj , γ) added to the "neoclassical net effect"1/sj − s2j . Also, the neoclassical "net effect"is minimum
when sj = 1/2, taking te low percentage of skill workers in Brazil we can assume that sj < 1/2, implying a
large “neoclassical effect” on regions. Therefore, for an empirical confirmation of equation (7), externalities
must be stronger than the “neoclassic net effect” of the region. Analogously, under these conditions, in the
               0           0
case when f1 (sj , γ) = f2 (sj , γ) = γsj , external returns to education for unskilled workers will be higher
for low human capital stocks in "j". According to this model, it is possible that empirical evidence for
countries or even regions of the same country with different levels of human capital presents different
results regarding the magnitude of the relation between concentration of human capital and productivity
gains, not being directly comparable.
           In summary, the main result of the model for equation (2), suggests that human capital concentra-
tion influences skilled and unskilled workers wages differently through two forces, “spillovers effect” and
the “neoclassical effect”. The former operates through productive externalities generated by the concen-


                                                          5
tration of skilled workers - which makes access to information and learning easier and faster, among other
reasons - increasing the productivity of both workers. The later derives from imperfect substitution between
skilled and unskilled workers - an increase in the supply of skilled workers reduces the productivity of these
individuals and thus their wages, but raises the productivity of the unskilled.


4     Empirical Strategy and Descriptive Statistics
To achieve the goal of correctly estimate human capital externalities in local productivity, measure trought
real wages, we must consider the possible sources of omitted variable bias and the subsequent difficulties
that its existence imposes the estimation
          The first source of bias, on the individual level, is the workers unobserved heterogeneity may
affect estimation. Individuals observed in cities with a higher concentration of human capital may have
more ability than individuals with the same formal educational level residing in a location with a lower
concentration of human capital. As stated by Moretti (2004a), this type of sorting can be problematic if
cities with a higher share of college are associated with a high return for unobserved abilities, attracting the
most skillful and affecting the labor force composition.
          Second, on the local level, another potential source of bias is related to shocks in the local labor
market, which may be correlated with the concentration of skilled workers in the locality. Even with cities
fixed effects, time-varying factors may affect the stock of human capital or wages between cities. For exam-
ple, shocks can attract skilled workers to a particular region and to raise wages (Moretti, 2004a; Falcão &
Silveira Neto, 2007). This problem is adressed by constructing a demand shock index for each educational
group and area, which represents the expected change in employment for an educational group in the area.
          Finally, as explained in Combes et al. (2010), density and measures of productivity (wages) may
be simultaneously determined, because more productive places tend to attract more workers and as a result
become denser. This issue is refered as the “endogenous quantity of labor” problem, a higher employment
density can exacerbate the knowledge spillover, despite of human capital concentration. Including employ-
ment density as a control variable, seeks to obtain a effect of human capital externalities “clean” of density
effect.

4.1 Model Specification
To simultaneously control all of these bias sources, we use a two step estimation approach2 adapting from
Heuermann (2011) and Groot et al. (2014). The first step consists in estimate a Mincerian type equation
for individual-level data given by equation (8):

workers abilities.
         The second step regression uses first step estimates of local wage indexes, λ̂j,t , as dependent
variable in a regression on local human capital concentration, employment density. Also, as we know from
economic theory, market structure can affect prices and wages, therefore, we include the share of jobs
in industry, a sector with historically higher wages and three measures for, specialization, diversity and
competition3 (that will be define below) as shown in equation (9):

         In this set up we are interested in correctly estimate α1 , the effect of human capital concentration
on the local wage index. However, as discussed earlier, in the second step we also should use strategies to
control for possible sources of bias.
         First, in order to control for the “endogenous quantity of labor” we first use lagged population
density as instrument for current employment density. As argued by Combes et al. (2010) for the french
case, considering a relatively constant urban hierarchy, highly dense regions today were highly dense in
the past, however, in those days the most important sector was agriculture and density was affect only
by the capability of sustain population. In a relative young country as Brazil, the urban hierarchy may
not be highly stable and the drivers of urban center development in Brazil can be potentialy related to
main historical economic cycles from the colonial period, such as the sugar-cane, gold mining and coffee
production as discussed by Naritomi et al. (2012). The autors construct a variable which indicates the
influence of each of those economic cycles in the brazilian municipalites with value 1 for those directly
affected and defined by
                                                     

where di is the distance from municipality i to the closest municipality directly involved in the respective
resource boom. The assumption is that these economic episodes help define the brazilian urban structure by
partialy deteming urban centers location and development and no longer are related to the current productive
structure, making then a plausable instrument for employment density.
          Also, we must include other market area variables related to local wages. For market measures
we first use the specialization index given by equation (11), in which a value close to 0 indicates industrial
composition in the region is similar to the national one, for values closed to 1 the labor market area is
completely specialized. As Henderson (2010) affirms, standardized manufacturing activity benefits from
agglomeration generating productivity improvents that can affect local wages.

          The second market measures included as control is for diversity, since Jacobs (1970) arguments
that a city with larger sector diversity, because in diverse cities there is more interchange of diferent ideas
(Glaeser et al. , 1992). Following Combes et al. (2011), we use a Inverse Herfindahl Index given by
equation (12), in which higher values represents higher diversity within labor market area.

          For the last market measure, we include a degree of competition measure given by equation (13),
where values larger then one indicates larger competition in the industry within a particular labor market
area. Competition can have a dual effect on productivity improvements, which can affect local wages.
A greater competition accelerate imitation and improvement of inovative ideias on one hand and reduces
returns to inovators (Glaeser et al. , 1992).

          Finally, we use an instrumental variable approach proposed by Moretti (2004a) to control for pos-
sible demand shocks that attract skilled workers to a particular region and raise wages. The proposed
instrument seeks to capture the generational change in the schooling of the regions considered in the analy-
sis, such instrument is supposedly correlated with the human capital stock, but is not influenced by current
shocks in the local labor market. Moretti (2004a) argues the existence of a long-run trend of incresing edu-
cation, as younger and more educated cohorts enters the labor force, as relative population shares of diferent
cohorts vary across cities, this will lead to diferential trends in college share across cities. The instrument
is defined as:
                                                    X
                                             IV =        ωmj ∆Pm ,                                         (14)

where m identifies age groups, j the geographical unit, ωmj the proportion of individuals living in the
region j in 1980 and who, in 2000’s, belonged to the m age group, finally ∆Pm captures national change in
the share of skilled workers by group m between the various years of the study (2002 to 2014). The authors
note that, if the age distribution of cities may reflects expected changes in the local economy the estimates
would still be biased, usage of lagged values circunvent this issue.

4.2 Data
As previously discussed, in order to achieve proposed objective, it’s necessary to initially estimate equa-
tion (8), generating a local wage index . For this, we must have individual-level wage information, socioe-
conomic characteristics, labor relations type and individual location. For the brazilian case, at the national
level, the main database that meets these requirements is given by the Ministry of Labor’s Annual Social
Information Report (RAIS).
          The RAIS dataset consists of information on all formal workers in the country, whose advantages
are its scope, longitudinal structure of the information and geographical breakdown. These advantages al-
low include worker fixed effects in order to correct the unobserved heteroneneity bias. However, because it
is restricted to formal workers, it leaves aside a large part of the individuals employed in the country. For-
tunately, as emphasized by Baruffi et al. (2016), during the first decades of economic stabilization (first and
second decades of the current century), the process of formalization guarantees a greater representativeness
of the RAIS dataset. To put into perspective, for 2002 the RAIS dataset contains about 46 million workers,
increasing in 2014 to more then 76 million workers.
          In order to avoid computational issues we decide to keep only seven time periods, all the even
year from 2002 to 2014. Also, we keep only the workes who had a permanent job contract with at least 20
weekly hours that was active at the end of the year. In order to create a more homogeneus sample we also
removed the public administration workers, since wages in this sector do not necessarily reflect workers
productivity and presents a specific contract relation. Finally, we considered only men between 18 and
56 years of age. With the selections discussed above, we built a panel at individual level for the workers
present in every considered year. With this in mind our final sample consists of 1,327,411 workers for each
year, for a total of 9,291,877 observations.
          For the Brazilian case the most disaggregated administative unit is the municipality, however, labor
market interactions often cross administratively defined boundaries. For this reason, Combes et al. (2008,
2010) for the french case, use employment zones built by the French Ministry of Labor in their analisys
of agglomeration externalities and Ahrend et al. (2014) uses functional urban areas, built by for OECD
countries, in their analysis cross-country analysis of productivity. A direct equivalent for Brazil are the
so-called Regiões de Influência (Regions of Influence) which are areas of influence of local urban centers
that takes into account the brazilian urban network and all daily commuting and transportation connections
among the municipalities, created by the Brazilian Statistics Bureau IBGE (2013). In it’s most desagregates
form, the country is divided into 482 Regions of Influence (REGIC) that can be thought as labor market
areas and will be reffered to as such from now on. Before presenting results, we perform a brief descriptive

          In Table 1, we present the descriptive statistics for the first step variables, that is, in equation (8) for
2002, 2014 and the role period. As can be seen, the average monthly wage for the period is R$ 1,370 with
a high standard deviation indicating great wage inequality among sample workers. Also, the average age is
almost 40 years and a 98 months tenure, this can be reflected in the restriction of the sample to individuals
that are present in the sample in all seven periods considered between 2002 and 2014. The low percentage
educational level obtaneid by the workforce is striking, Table 1 shows that only 10% of them have at least
a college degree, the majority finishes high school. By this metric it is easy to observe the low overall stock
of human capital in brazilian cities.
          The descriptive statistics of second step (labor market area level) information are show in Table 2.
As previously discussed, local wages indexes where estimated by including dummies for each labor market
area and year combination, thus it becomes a measure of wage for each labor area. On average, 6% of a
regic workers have college degrees, our chosen metric for human capital concentration. The high standard
deviation (0.12) imply a high human capital inequality between labor market areas. Indeed, many recent
articles in Brazil discuss the importance of human capital and wage differentials in income inequality and
its recent decline (Barros et al. , 2007; Tavares & Menezes Filho, 2011; Silva et al. , 2016).
          As can be seen, on average labor areas have similar composition to national one. The index shows
a larger variation with an average of 0.31 and 0.36 as standard deviation. As we can see, on average, labor
market areas presents less competition compared to the country. However, there is cases of high competition
as the maximum copetition index approachs 5.
          Finally, in Table 2 we have the measure of proximity of each labor market area to major colonial
economic cicles. As previously explained, values close to 1 shows greater proximity and therefore greater
influence. As shown by Naritomi et al. (2012), these economic episodes have a long standing impact
on local institutional framework, measure by access to justice, land inequality and governance. For our
purpuses, these institutional outcomes can affect human capital concentration and density today, and must
be considered.

5     Results
In Table 3, we show the results for the first step estimation, following equation (8). As we can see, the overall
fit is satisfactory with a R2 of 0.45 with all control variables presenting highly significant coefficients.
Wages are higher for older and longer tenured workers, although there is a nonlinearity in age presente by
the negative coefficiente of age2 . Higher educational levels and working on larger firms positively correlate
with higher wages. The inclusion of dummies for REGIC and year interactions, allows the estimation of
λj,t to be use in the second step.
           As previously discussed, the unobserved worker heterogeneities can turn OLS estimations incon-
sistent, therefore, we perform a panel with individual fixed-effect estimation, the last two columns of Table 3
presentes the results. As we can see, effects of educational levels an firm size on individual wages, although
still highly significant, are strongly reduced, indicating that a considerable share of those returns were from
unobserved ability. This highlights the importance of controls for unobserve ability. Given that fixed-effect
estimation appears to be the most adequate4 , in the second step the wage indexes from this estimation will
be used.
           In the second step, with the estimates of local wage indexes and control variables aggregated in
labor market area level, we estimate equation (9). Again, to provide stronger conclusions, the existence
of sorting and consequent endogeneity of human capital concentration and local wage indexes requires
an estimation strategy with instrumental variables, therefore the second step was estimated using a 2SLS
approach. In order to assess their relevance, in Table 4 we present the first stage estimation. We can see
that as expected the proposed instruments are relevant only for it’s endogenous counterparts, that is, the
demographic schooling structure instrument is relevant for Human Capital and population density, sugar,
gold and coffee booms are relevant for employment density.
           Second step results are presented in Table 5. For comparison, we present, in the first column,
OLS estimation of the equation (9), we can see that the concentration of human capital has a positive

and significant effect on the hourly wages of workers, a one point increase in the share of workers with
college increases labor market areas wages by 0.70%. However, employment density presents a negative
impact of wages, contradicting the aglomeration literature when we don’t control for the “endogenous labor
quantitiy”.
          The 2SLS estimation results are presented in the third column of Table 5. As we can see, the effect
of interest grows to 0.859, a 22% increase, indicating that a one point increase in the share of workers with
college increases labor market areas wages by 0.86%. This effect in similar to Moretti (2004a) findings
of positive externalities for human capital concentration (around 1.14%). With inclusion of instruments
for employment density it’s estimate becomes positive and significant, implying that denser labor market
areas presents higher wages as in Barufi et al. (2016). Market measures introduced as controls are not
statistically significant but their inclusion in important for an obtaining an unbiased estimate of human
capital concentration on local wages. Finally, although skilled demand shock no longer plays a significant
role, the impact of unskilled demand shocks remains important for the wages in the period.
          These results offer evidence on the existence of human capital externalities, however, in order to
empiricaly test the assumption of a distinct effect between educational groups as proposed by the theoretical
model of Section 3, we must perform separate estimates for different educational groups.

5.1 Effect on Different Educational Groups
As previously discussed, human capital concentration influences skilled and unskilled workers wages dif-
ferently through two forces, “spillovers effect” and the “neoclassical effect”. The former operates through
productive externalities generated by the concentration of skilled workers - which makes access to infor-
mation and learning easier and faster, among other reasons - increasing the productivity of both workers.
Therefore we must reestimate the equation (8) considering this differentiation.
          Considering that both groups are present in the regions labor markets and wage determination is
simultaneos, in this set up separately estimate the first step for each group is not a good strategy. Therefore,
we included a interaction dummy between Dj,t the dummies for each local and year, with a skilled worker
dummy. Implicitly considering the hypothesis that there is an effect of the concentration of human capital
for all the workers, with a specific return added for skilled workers trough education.
          The second step regression uses first step estimates of local wage indexes λ̂j,t only, for the uns-
killed group and λ̂j,t added with a dummy for skilled group, estimation results are presented in Table 6.
Theorical prediction, according to equation (7) is that a marginal increase in the stock of human capital in a
given region will have a larger positive effect on skilled workers wages than of unskilled if the "externality
effect"overcome the neoclassical "net effect". As we can see, our results show that wages of both groups
are affected by the externalities resulting from the concentration of human capital. Moreover, as the effect
found is greater for non-skilled individuals (0.73%) then for skilled (0.25%), we can imply that these ex-
ternalities for the skilled group are not strong enough to outweigh the gains in the wages of the unskilled
when we also consider the neoclassical effect. These results are similar to Moretti (2004a), which finds a
1.6% for highschool graduates and 0.4% for college graduates.

5.2 Effect on Different Sectors
As stated by Heuermann (2011), labour market institutions and the relative importance of knowledge and
physical capital as factors of production can be quite diverse across industries. This fact together with
findings of wage differences across sectors makes interesting to know the specific impacts of human capital
concentration across industries in order to promote strategies and improve their efficiency. Therefore, in
order to evaluate these differences, we repeat our baseline estimation separately considering a agregation
of two-digit CNAE divisions into four large groups, namelly, manufacturing industry, extractive industry,
construction and services. Results are presented in Table (7)

          As we can see, the results confirm a variety in human capital concentration effects the effects
between different sectors, implying that human capital concentration benefits are unevenly distributed. For
example, we find larger effects for manufacturing with (0.52%) and services (0.36%), with no significant ef-
fect for the remaining two groups, extractive industry and construction. However, these results are intuitive
given their underlying caracteristics of low gains of exchange of information and social enviorment. On the
other hand, concentration externalities play a important role for extractive, as the coeficient of employment
density was positive and highly significant for these sectors.
          Our results are in line with (Heuermann, 2011), which finds for West Germany positive effects for
the manufacturing industry and services, the former with highest effects than the later. As an explanation,
the author uses the notion of pecuniary externalities versus tecnological externalities as microeconomic
sources for human capital externalities. The first arises when the firms relate their investments in physical
capital to local human capital endowments, which could be true for physical capital intensive industries
like the manufacturing. while the second arises when externalities come from the exchange of knowledge
between firms and workers, more probable in services. Specifically for Brazil, we have no knowledge of
directly comparable results, since Barufi et al. (2016) focus on the employment density effect.

5.3 Robustness Checks
In order to assess the validity of human capital agglomeration effects, in this section we perform a series
of robustness checks. First we include as controls variables related to amenities and geographical cha-
racteristics possibly correlated to wages. With the notion of compensatory wages5 , part of the existing
wage variations compensate the accessibility to amenities. Without including controls for this compensa-
tion could lead to a overestimation of the true effect, therefore, in order to correctly evaluate the effect of
human capital concentration on local wage indexes, inclusion of amenities and geographic characteristics
controls is necessary. Therefore, we include altitude, number of sunny days, number of rainy days, distance
to equator and distance to sea as controls.
          In the remainder robustness checks, we repeat the baseline estimation using subsets of labor market
areas. First we exclude Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo labor makert areas from the estimation based on concerns
that, given Brazil’s urban hierarchy with two disproportionately big metropolitan areas, São Paulo and Rio
de Janeiro influence on the overall results may be overwhelming. We then restrict the estimation for only
non-Metropolitan labor makert areas is order to evaluate if results hold outside metropolitan areas. For
this we considered only the areas were none of its composing municipalities lay in metropolitan regions,
ending up with 357 non-metropolitan labor market areas.6 . Finally, as a way to evaluate if the results are
   5 See   Roback (1982).
   6 Unfortunately, it is not possible to perform an estimation considering only the metropolitan regions by their small number, creating

problems on the estimation matrix rank.

generalized even in the smaller labor market areas of the sample, we separatly estimate the model for the
50% smaller and 50% larger areas, which produces a population cutpoint of about 250,000.
          Results for all robustness checks are presented in Table (8). Column (1) shows the effect of interest
on a regression including the aforementioned variables. This result should be compared with the coeficient
of the 2SLS estimation of table (5). The inclusion of amenities and geografical control variables reduces
the human capital concentration effect on local wage indexes from 0.86% to 0.77%, implying that 11% of
the effect comes from compensation for amenities accessibility and suggesting that a high parcel of college
degree ocurrs in less ameable places. More importantly, the effect of interest remains highly significant.
On column (2) we have results from estimation without Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, as we can see,
they remain unchanged relative to the baseline estimate, indicating that the impact of the concentration of
human capital on wage rates is not by the two largest brazilian labor market areas. Results are show in
the third column of Table (8) and in this case, we found that human capital externalities are slightly larger
(0.89%) and still highly significant. Results from the last two column of Table (8) shown a slightly higher
point estimate of human capital concentration effect on local wages in the smaller regics, which could be
associated implying with the relative scarcity of human capital in those areas.


6    Concluding Remarks
As recent research about the external returns to human capital shows, these gains can be bigger than indivi-
dual returns and, thus, can play an important role in explaining spatial urban inequalities. Recent research
about urban agglomeration gains in Brazil indicates that they are significant , but these researches have not
explored the importance of local concentration of human capital. The present paper, fills that gap, with
the objective of identify and to measure the external returns to human capital concentration, defined by the
share of local workes with at least college degree, in Brazil. In agreement with the avaible national and
international literature, we find strong evidence of the existence of large external effects of concentration of
human capital in Brazil, with a 0.86% baseline effect of human capital concentration on local wages.

         Moreover, theoretical prediction is that marginal increase in the stock of human capital in a given
region will have a greater positive effect on skilled workers wages than of unskilled workers only if the
"externality effect"overcome the wage gains of unskilled workers added to the neoclassical "net effect". We
find larger effect for the unskilled workers so we may infer that human capital externalities for the skilled
group, although existing, are not strong enough to outweigh the gains in the wages of the unskilled when we
also consider the neoclassical effect. We also investigated the differentiated effects among sectors, finding
large and significant effects for manufacturing and commercer, with no effect for extractive industry and
construction, in line with available international results.
         Results were robust to a series of checks, such as inclusion of amenities related and geographical
characteristics controls variables possibly correlated to wages, we still find a highly signicant human capital
concentration effect 0.77%, a 11% reduction from baseline estimates. We repeat the baseline estimation
using subsets of labor market areas, excluding Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo, consider only non-Metropolitan,
smaller and larger areas. Results ranged from 0.88% in non-metropolitan areas to 0.83% for the smaller
population areas.
         The existence of external returns, as found in the present study, corroborates the importance of
human capital investiment as a police for reducing regional inequality as a development strategy. By pre-
senting evidence of human capital concentration on local wages, identifing another powerful explanation
for wages differences across brazilian labor markets, while at the same time contributing to evidences of
