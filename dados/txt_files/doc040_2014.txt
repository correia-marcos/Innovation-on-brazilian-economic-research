          Real ex hange rate is an important ma roe onomi pri e in the e on-
      omy and ae ts e onomi a tivity, interest rates, domesti pri es, trade
      and investiments ows among other variables. Methodologies have been
      developed in empiri al ex hange rate misalignment studies to evaluate
      whether a real ee tive ex hange is overvalued or undervalued. There is
      a vast body of literature on the determinants of long-term real ex hange
      rates and on empiri al strategies to implement the equilibrium norms
      obtained from theoreti al models. This study seeks to ontribute to this
      literature by showing that it is possible to al ulate the misalignment from
      a mixed ointegrated ve tor error orre tion framework. An empiri al ex-
      er ise using United States' real ex hange rate data is performed. The
      results suggest that the model with mixed frequen y data is preferred to
      the models with same frequen y variables.

Introdu tion

   An important ma roe onomi         pri e in the e onomy is the real ex hange

rate.   This variable ae ts e onomi    a tivity, interest rates, domesti   pri es

in the e onomy.     Thus, large movements in the real ex hange rate      an have

important ee ts on those variables. The empiri al and theoreti al literature

seeks to respond if su h movements are ex essive or are in line with a   hange in

fundamentals. The literature has advan ed towards a better understanding of

long-term determinants of the real ex hange rate. Empiri al strategies      an be

formulated based on models that use the do trine of Pur hasing Power Parity

(PPP) or based on fundamentals analysis.

   There is a vast literature that seeks to obtain the best estimate for the

misalignment of the real ex hange rate. Basi ally, this debate an be divided into

a sear h for the determinants of real ex hange rate in theoreti al and empiri al

grounds. The rst issue is to dis uss what are the determinants of real ex hange

rate from dierent theories. The se ond issue has to do with the      hoi e of the

best empiri al strategy to implement a spe i    norm to estimate real ex hange

rate misalignment. This work fo us on the se ond issue.

   The main motivation for using mixed frequen y models       omes from the fa t

that real ee tive ex hange rate and many its fundamentals     an be observed at

a dierent frequen ies. Although there might be a great loss of information if

the analyst opt to work with models at the lowest available frequen y, this is the

usual     hoi e in the literature. By temporal aggregating the data, the analyst

 an in ur in bias when estimating the parameters of a time series model. If the

analysts opt to work with end of period data he will loose the information of

higher frequen y data. Working with mixed frequen y data models is a natural

 hoi e.

   Our goal is to estimate a mixed frequen y ve tor error        orre tion model
(MF-VECM) an obtain an estimative of real ex hange rate misalignment for
United States.    The MF-VECM methodology follows the resear h of GÃ¶tz et
al (2013). Our paper address the     osts and benets of using mixed frequen y
models to address ex hange rate misalignment.
   Regarding the results, we     an anti ipate that the mixed frequen y models
are superior to the low frequen y models for the analyzed dataset .

   The arti le is divided into ve se tions, besides this introdu tion. The rst

se tion briey reviews the literature of models for the misalignment of the ex-

 hange rate. The se ond se tion presents the methodology for MF-VECM with

variables in mixed frequen y. The third se tion presents the data used in the

work. Finally, we make     on luding remarks.


1       Brief review of real ex hange rate misalign-

        ment literature

    The literature on real ex hange rate is extensive (Froot and Rogo, 1995).

The     lassi al do trine and perhaps the oldest one on real ex hange rate deter-

minants is the Pur hasing Power Parity (PPP). Referen e to this theory            an

be found in    lassi al authors. Re ent studies   onrm the validity of PPP for

tradable goods although the adjustment towards equilibrium is quiet slow. Ah-

mad and Craighead (2010) obtained strong eviden e of mean reversion with

high half-life using a se ular   onsumer pri es index dataset for United States

and United Kindgom. Their work investigates the point made by Taylor (2001)

about the ee ts of temporal aggregation on the tests of PPP.

    There is a theoreti al dis ussion about whi h variables drives the real ex-

 hange rate in the long-term. An older literature goes ba k to Edwards (1987

and 1991) and Dornbus h (1976).        The rst analyzes the     auses and     onse-

quen es of ex hange rate misalignment. The se ond one is the        lassi     exible

ex hange model approa h under whi h monetary poli y sho ks        ause deviations

from PPP fundamentals.

    The studies of Bilson (1979) and Mussa (1976) are also       lassi als.    These

are key referen es for the monetary approa h to the ex hange rate. Under this

approa h, the ex hange rate would be primarily driven by the following funda-

mentals: the dieren e between domesti       and foreign in ome and the money

supply. The approa h assumes that PPP and un overed interest parity (UIP)

holds    ontinuously and the demand for money is stable in all   ountries. The re-

sear h of Meese and Rogo (1983)     asts doubt on the explanatory power of this

theory by showing that the predi tions of this approa h are not superior to a

'naive' fore ast model for the ex hange rate su h as a pure random walk. Rossi

(2013) shows that the random walk       an be outperformed by an e onometri

model that uses the information based on net foreign investiment position.

    Stein (1995) formulates the natural ex hange rate approa h (NATREX).

A   ording to the author, the equilibrium ex hange is the one that equals the

level of investment savings generated by e onomi    fundamentals.

    Williamson (1994) had a great impa t on the ex hange rate misalignment




                                         3
literature. The equilibrium ex hange rate for the author is the one that allows

a   ountry to sustain a desirable result in the external a           ounts.   This is the

fundamental real ex hange rate approa h (FRER). A more re ent referen e to

this approa h is Cline and Williamson (2007).             A limitation of this approa h

 omes from the high degree of arbitrariness and subje tivity in               hoosing the

target of foreign a       ounts. The results may not be robust to dierent targets.

In addition, this approa h fo uses on ows and not sto ks.

        Faruqee (1995) in orporates issues related to the evolution of sto ks and

 onstru ts a model whi h allows for intera tion between ows and sto ks. Thus,

there must be a stable relationship between real ex hange rate and net foreign

asset position between residents and non-residents. This is         alled behavioral real

ex hange rate approa h (BRER). The model is extended by Alberola, Cervero

et al. (1999).

        Kubota (2009) uses a model with a representative agent who maximizes

intertemporal       onsumption and a        umulates    apital. This study indi ates that

the real ex hange rate is a fun tion of terms of trade, net external position

and relative produ tivity of tradable and non-tradable se tors. This approa h

seeks to redu e the degree of subje tivity in the estimation of the ex hange rate

misalignment. Thus, she establishes a link between the real ex hange rate and

a set of fundamentals derived from a theoreti al model. Then, she de omposes

the series of real ex hange rate in transitory and permanent            omponents using

time series e onometri        te hnique.

        Re ently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) started to systemati ally

disseminate the results of sta resear h eort to measure the ex hange rate

misalignment in several         ountries members of the Fund.The External Balan e

Assessment (EBA) methodology, developed by IMF's Resear h Department, is

based on two panel estimations: for          urrent a   ount and real ee tive ex hange
                   1
rate (REER) indi es . The basi              idea is that the REER      an be written as a

fun tion of the output gap, real interest rate dierential and fa tors that may

ae t saving, investment,        urrent a    ount,   apital ows and    hanges in foreign

 ommodity terms of trade, trade openness, share of administered pri es, VIX ,
                                                                                       2

3       Methodology and data des ription

3.1 Database
    In this work, we use quartely and annual data for the United States from

1971 to 2013. The real ee tive ex hange rate and the index of                   onsumer and of

wholesale pri es were        olle ted in International Finan ial Statisti s (IFS - IMF).

The foreign trade weights were           olle ted from the International Monetary Fund

(IMF) - Dire tion of Trade Statisti s (DOTS-IMF). The values of net foreign

assets are net position of assets and liabilities of residents and non-residents.

This variable was obtained using from Lane and Milesi-Ferreti (2007) and IFS

- IMF. The variable used in the model is the net foreign asset divided by the

GDP (Gross Domesti               Produ t).

    The index of    onsumer (CPI) and of wholesale pri es (WPI) were used for the

Balassa-Samuelson variable. The BS variable was                  al ulated for   ountry i by the

ratio   CP Ii /W P Ii   of   ountry i relative to the international ratio         CP Iiâˆ— /W P Iiâˆ—
( onstru ted from the weights of foreign trade previously mentioned).


3.2 E onometri methodology
    This work applied the mixed frequen y VECM stru ture, like (3). In this

resear h, three variables are used: the real ex hange rate (RER), net foreign

assets divided by the GDP (denominated by NFA only) and relative pri e vari-

able (hereafter referred as Balassa-Samuelson variable or just BS). The high

frequen y variable (quarterly) are RER and BS, while the low frequen y vari-

able (annual) is the NFA
                                   4 . The high frequen y variables were in luded quar-

terly. They are also available at monthly frequen y, but the model will have to

many parameters to be estimated given the available sample size. The VECM

stru ture with mixed frequen y represented by equation (1) has the following

variables:

pre-spe ied (we denominated as not genuine                ointegration relationships) by

   4 The NFA variable presents quarterly data for U.S., but only for the re ent period. There-
fore, we use this variable in the low frequen y (annual). Another point is that we ould use
monthly data for BS and RER variables for estimation in mixed frequen y. However, the
number of parameters to be estimated in reased onsiderably, whi h did not allow estimation
with enough degrees of freedom in this ase.

 ointegration relationships).

    After estimating the       ointegration relationship, we intend to get the measure

of real ex hange rate misalignment with mixed frequen y. This type of analysis

is not done by Gotz et al (2013). The present work                     al ulates the misalignment

of the ex hange rate based on the de omposition of Gonzalo and Granger (1995).

Before, we present the simple             ase of the de omposition used to get a measure

of real ex hange rate misalignment.

    Several de ompositions have been proposed in the literature to de ompose

the series between transitory and permanent                   omponents. The permanent         om-

ponent is      onsidered the fundamentals of the e onomy, while the transitory

 omponent represent the misalignment of the real ex hange rate.                         In general,

the de omposition takes the folowing form:




                   xi,t    =    [ciâŠ¥ (Î²iâ€² ciâŠ¥ )âˆ’1 Î²iâ€² + Î²iâŠ¥ (câ€²i Î²iâŠ¥ )âˆ’1 ci ]xi,t               (5)



The existen e of this de omposition is not always guaranteed sin e the matrix

câ€²i Î²iâŠ¥   may not have full rank. Gonzalo and Granger (1995) proposed                     ci = Î±iâŠ¥ .
Using the de omposition of Gonzalo and Granger, it is possible to                          al ulate

the transitory     omponent (Tit ) and the permament                     omponent (Pit ) from the

following equations:




                               P it     =       Î²i (Î±â€²iâŠ¥ Î²iâŠ¥ )âˆ’1 Î±â€²iâŠ¥ xi,t                      (6)




                                      T it = Î±i (Î²iâ€² Î±i )âˆ’1 Î²iâ€² xi,t                            (7)



    This leads to a minor adaptation                  ompared to the         ase with the same fre-

quen y be ause the estimated                ointegrating relationship is the one that would

lead to an estimate of the e onomi                 fundamentals. In this        ase, the permanent

and transitory     omponents are            al ulated in the same manner as in (6) and (7).

But instead of the entire matrix            Î±   and   Î²,   we will use only the rst    olumn of   Î±
and   Î²   be ause of the   omment made earlier. So, these pro edures will be per-

formed in the next se tion together with the spe i ation tests of the stru ture

of mixed frequen y.

4       Results

4.1 Cointegration and spe i ation tests and nal estima-
    tion of the VECM
      First, we dis uss the Horvath and Watson (1995)                 ointegration test result.

The value of the test statisti             al ulated is 264.96, while the     riti al value based

on Horvath and Watson (1995) is 12.49. The null hypothesis of no                    ointegration

between          RER, N F A    and   BS    is strongly reje ted. As already aforementioned

our spe i ation           hoi e for the model does not         ontain further short-term dy-

nami s than lagged values of the variables within the same year due to sample

size restri tions.

      Be ause of the small sample, we tested the possibility of redu ing the number

of estimated parameters. One of the tests was to see if we                   ould eliminate the

not genuine          ointegrating ve tors of the model. Be ause the            oe ients of the

matrix       Î²   are given, it is ne essary to restri t some of the parameters in matrix

Î±.   The likelihood ratio test was used for su h test, in whi h the null hypothesis

was the restri ted estimation (no not genuine
                                                                                           5
                                                             ointegration relationships) . The

value of the test          al ulated is 325.73, while the       riti al value based on the       hi-

squared distribution with            v   degrees of freedom (where    v   is the total number of

parameters redu ed by the restri ted estimation) is 84.50.

      We tested the presen e of ommon features that annihilate the pre-determined

 ointegration relationships by a likelihood ratio test. The null hypothesis                    orre-

sponds to the restri ted estimation (that is, the model with                  ommon features),

while the alternative is the model without                 ommon features. The value of the

test    al ulated is 187.75, while the           riti al value based on the      hi-squared dis-

tribution with         v   degrees of freedom is 66.77. Then, the best model does not

 ontain          ommon features. But the likelihood ratio test has size distortion in a

small sample.          In other words, the null hypothesis is reje ted too often when

it's true.        So, we    ompare the information          riteria between models with and

without          ommon features as an alternative measure, whi h is shown in Table 1.

The result of three information              riteria    orroborates the likelihood test.

      Finally, the last test seeks to answer the following question: whi h model

is better?         The model that          ontains mixed frequen y data or that            ontains

only lower frequen y variables (in the same frequen y)?                    The null hypothesis

     5 Hen   eforth, all likelihood ratio tests are based on the onden e level of 5%.

third and se ond quarters and the quarterly variation in BS of the fourth quar-

ter. The RER variable is only ae ted by its own lagged quarterly hanges. The

BS variable responds to the RER and its lagged quarterly variations. The RER

and BS variables of the rst and se ond quarters (mostly) are greatly ae ted

by past quarterly u tuations. But this follows from the VECM stru ture with

mixed frequen y that is used. The rst and se ond quarters are     loser (more

than the other dependent variables on third and four quarters) of the fourth,

third and se ond quarters of the previous year.

   After we estimate the VECM with mixed frequen y, we apply the de ompo-

sition of Gonzalo and Granger to generate the misalignment of the real ex hange

rate (transitory   omponent). Figure 1 shows the estimates of the misalignment

of the real ex hange rate with the VECM in mixed frequen y. Fo using on re-

 ent period, we obtain that the dollar is depre iated sin e the rst quarter of

2011 (after a   ounting for the fundamentals). This movement    an be seem as

a side ee t of U.S. un onventional monetary poli y, in whi h the se ond and

more   omprehensive quantitative easing was announ ed in November 2010, but

    Next, we     ompare the estimated misalignment of the real ex hange rate

obtained by the variables with mixed frequen y or with the same frequen y.

Spe i ally, we will    ompare the annual         hange in the real ex hange rate based
                                        8
on the fourth quarter, shown in Figure 2 . The two estimates of misalignment

of the real ex hange rate diverge         onsiderably in value or even its movement

in some periods. There are at least two reasons to be any dieren e between

the two ways of      al ulating the misalignment. First, the estimated             ointegra-

tion relationship is dierent, espe ially for the          oe ient of BS. Se ond, the

stru ture with mixed frequen y         onsiders the adjustment of quarterly variables

(BS and RER) to        al ulate the misalignment. Fo using on the re ent period,

the estimated misalignments totally diverge from 2009 onwards. Overall, the

estimated misalignment of the real ex hange rate with the variables at the same

frequen y does not seem to        hange be ause of U.S. monetary poli y to weaken

the dollar.

    Last, but not least, we will evaluate the two models a            ording to the degree
             9
of adjustment . We will use the RMSE (Root-Mean-Square Error) indi ator as

one of the ways of evaluating rival models. The RMSE measures the dieren e

   8 When variables in the same frequen ies are used, it is only possible to estimate the mis-
alignment of the real ex hange rate in luding the variation of fourth quarter (end of period).
   9 We did not fore ast out of sample due to the small number of degrees of freedom that we
have.

the better the model. In our       ase, we de ided to evaluate only the last obser-

vation of the RER in the fourth quarter. In this         ase,   RM SE = 0.0071     of the

model with the variables in mixed frequen y and        RM SE = 0.0295 of the model
with the variables in the same frequen y. The latter is almost three times higher

than the former.

   Another way to       ompare the two models is graphi ally.         So, we show the

expe ted and realized values by RER variable in the fourth quarter of ea h

year, as shown in Figure 3.        The predi ted value by the model with mixed

frequen y seems to follow more        losely the realized values for the se ond part

of the sample, performing parti ularly well for the last two years of the sample.


Con luding Remarks

   This paper aims to       onstru t mixed VECM using data available atmixed

frequen y to get the estimate of the misalignment of the real ex hange rate to

the U.S. between 1971 and 2013.         The stru ture with the variables in mixed

frequen y was preferred to the stru ture with variables at the same frequen y

by the information     riteria and the likelihood ratio test. This mixed frequen y

stru ture was preferred even though it has a higher number of parameters to

be estimated. There is eviden e of      ointegration between the variables from the

mixed frequen y stru ture. Furthermore, there is no eviden e of the presen e of

 ommon features, whi h would redu e the number parameters to be estimated.

   We obtained that an in rease in net foreign assets leads to appre iation of

the real ex hange rate in the long term as expe ted by theory. The variable that

responds to deviations from the long-term relationship (between NFA, RER and

BS) is only RER (rst, se ond and third quarters). This is a important fa t to

use the model to address ex hange rate misalignment. The speed of adjustment

of the long term disequilibrium is very similar, espe ially for the rst, se ond

and third quarters.

   Regarding the not genuine     ointegration relationships, the NFA variable re-

sponds (statisti ally signi antly) to quarterly variations in the RER of the

third and se ond quarters and the quarterly variation in BS of the fourth quar-

ter. The high frequen y variables of the rst and se ond quarters (mostly) are

greatly ae ted by past quarterly.

   After we estimate the VECM with mixed frequen y, we apply the de ompo-

sition of Gonzalo and Granger to generate the misalignment of the real ex hange

rate (transitory   omponent). Fo using on the re ent period, we obtain that the

dollar is undervalued sin e the rst quarter of 2011. This movement   an be seen

as a side ee t of United States un onventional monetary poli y.
