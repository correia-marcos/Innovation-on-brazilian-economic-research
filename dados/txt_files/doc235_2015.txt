Este artigo estende o modelo tradicional de fluxos de entrada e saída do desemprego para
incorporar dois tipos de emprego. Um modelo de quatro estados é apresentado e aplicado
ao Brasil, onde a informalidade é marcante no mercado de trabalho. Os resultados indicam
que a abordagem tradicional com três estados (desemprego, emprego e inatividade) é
insuficiente para o entendimento completo da dinâmica do mercado de trabalho observada
na última década, já que ele superestima a contribuição da probabilidade de saído do
emprego para a queda do desemprego. Ao separar o emprego formal do informal, os
resultados mostram que os principais fatores associados à queda na taxa de desemprego
entre 2003 e 2014 foram (em ordem de importância): (i) a queda na taxa de participação
que ocorreu por conta de uma menor taxa de entrada na PEA; (ii) o aumento da
probabilidade de entrada no emprego formal e (iii) a queda na probabilidade de entrada no
desemprego observada pelos trabalhadores com carteira assinada.

This paper extends the traditional literature on flows into and out of unemployment by
accounting for two different types of employment. We develop a four-state model and apply
it to Brazil, where formal and informal work are both relevant in the labor market. Our
findings suggest that the standard three-state approach is insufficient for a full
understanding of the labor market dynamics witnessed in the past decade, since it
overstates the contribution of the employment exit rate to the change in unemployment.
When disentangling formal and informal work, we find that the main drivers of the decline
in the unemployment rate between 2003 and 2014 were (in order of relevance): (i) the
decline in the participation rate that happened due to a decrease in the entries into the
workforce (from inactivity); (ii) the increase in the formal job finding rate and (iii) the
decline in the inflow from formal employment into unemployment.

1. Introduction

What drives the unemployment dynamics: inflows or outflows? Many authors raised this
question in the past decade, and still no consensus has emerged: answers change according
to the countries where the analysis is made and also depend on the methodology adopted
in each study. Understanding the unemployment rate dynamics is extremely relevant for
macroeconomic and labor market policies, since the absence or presence of cyclicality in
separations/admissions should drive employment protection policies and researchers’
attention.

While Hall (2005) and Shimer (2007 and 2012) found that in the US outflows dominates the
unemployment rate’s dynamics, Fujita and Ramey (2009) and Elsby et al. (2009) have
argued the opposite. Petrongolo and Pissarides (2008) found that in the UK and in Spain the
inflow rate explains roughly half of the changes in unemployment dynamics, whereas in
France the outflows are more relevant. Smith (2011) contributed by developing a slightly
different framework that accounts for deviations in the equilibrium unemployment rate. We
make a different, but in our view also relevant contributions to the theory developed by
these authors.

The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we extend the traditional framework that
calculates the relative importance of changes in inflow and outflow rates to equilibrium
unemployment dynamics by incorporating a second employment status. This is particularly
relevant for economies with large informal sectors, but even in the developed world this
might be useful. Particularly after the Great Recession, structural changes in the labor
markets are occurring throughout the world, with increases in the share of part time work
and contingent work. Attachment to employment or the labor force might be different
depending on the type of employment relationship, and thus accounting for these two
different states might be relevant.

Second, we investigate three relevant changes in the Brazilian labor market that occurred
in the past decade: the decline of roughly seven percentage points in the unemployment
rate (see Figure 1), the increase of more than 10 p.p. in the share of formal employment
from and the decline of roughly 1.5 p.p since 2012 in the share of the working age population
that engages in the labor market (the participation rate).

Menezes Filho et al. (2014) documented that the separation rate declined and the job
finding rate increased in Brazil in recent years and that both movements contributed to the
decline in the unemployment rate, but they argue that the latter explained almost entirely
the unemployment variation between 2002 and 2009. Silva and Pires (2014), using the
standard framework to assess which flows are more relevant to explain the unemployment
dynamics in Brazil, find the opposite and argue that more than 80% of the unemployment
rate variation is explained by changes in the separation rate (inflows). Attuy (2012) find
similar results, even though his focus is on the relationship between unemployment,
transitions and the business cycle. However, the last two papers do not pay proper attention
to movements in and out of the labor force, even if their modeling strategy allows for it; also,
there seems to be a confusion in both papers regarding what they are actually measuring.
The authors sometimes refer to the contributions of changes in the transitions rates’
volatility to the unemployment rate’s volatility as if they were contributions of changes in
the level of each rate to the level of unemployment.

Still, our findings show that in the traditional three state world, indeed it was the decline of
the inflows into unemployment that explain almost half of the decline in unemployment in
Brazil between 2003 and 2014. However, when disentangling informal and formal
employment (and thus allowing for a fourth state in the labor market), the most relevant
change was the decline in the likelihood of entering the workforce. If analyzing employment
types separately, the outflows of unemployment into formal employment explained slightly
more than the inflows (i.e. formal job finding rates dominate), whereas regarding informal
employment and unemployment, inflows and outflows almost offset each other. It seems
relevant, thus, to account for different labor market statuses in this type of analysis.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used throughout this paper.
Section 3 describes the standard three-state model used in the literature to assess changes
in the unemployment rate and describe the results of such model when applied to the
Brazilian case. Section 4 extends this model to account for two different employment types
and shows how results change with this improvement. Section 5 concludes.



2. Data

This paper uses the Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego (Monthly Employment Survey, henceforth
PME), a monthly rotating panel of households in six major metropolitan areas in Brazil (São
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Porto Alegre and Recife) surveyed by IBGE
(Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). The six regions represent roughly 25% of
the country's population, providing a reach set of information on employment in
Metropolitan Areas in Brazil. The paper covers the period from January, 2003 to December,

                                                                                                          3
20143. The survey investigates schooling, labor force status, demographic attributes, and
labor income of each dweller aged 10 or more that lives on the surveyed households. This
yields approximately 100,000 individuals from 35,000 households every month. We
restrain our sample to individuals aged between 15 and 70 years.

The rotating scheme is as follows. Each household is surveyed during the first four
consecutive months. After this initial period, the household leaves the sample for eight
months and then returns to the panel and is interviewed again for another four consecutive
months. After the eighth interview the household is permanently excluded from the sample.
Households are divided into 4 rotating groups in order to ensure that 75% of the sample is
repeated in two consecutive months.

Shimer (2012) argues that using survey data to measure the transition rates might yield
biased estimates due to time aggregation. In fact, several countries carry labor force surveys
on a quarterly basis, and both Shimer (2012) and Gomes (2015) show that quarterly data
underestimate the probability of transiting between states, because some individuals can
move more than once during this relatively long time span. Shimer (2012) proposes a
method to recover the instantaneous transitions, which he used in his study of the US case.
However, Petrongolo and Pissarides (2008) argue and Gomes (2015) shows that for
monthly surveys, time aggregation does not influence their results, whereas calculations
based on quarterly surveys are quite significantly affected. Based on Petrolongo ans
Pissarides, we have used discrete monthly transitions rates to obtain the results described
later in this paper.

One important caveat of PME survey is that it does not identify individuals directly. Only
their households are identified, making it difficult to match each person over time. Also
important to highlight is the fact that in each household only one individual answers the
questions for all members in each round. Thus, attrition and reporting errors occur with a
high frequency. For instance, it is common to have more than two years of difference in age
or schooling in two consecutive months for the same individual. We follow the matching
algorithm proposed by Ribas and Soares (2008), which corrects for misinformation on
individuals’ characteristics and reduces attrition. After pairing each individuals and
restraining the sample to the working age population (between 15 and 70 years of age), our
database contains 11,623,365 observations.

Because we are interested in transition rates, we only keep the observations for which we
have information for two consecutive months. To avoid attrition bias (which still remains
even after pairing individuals as shown by Ribas and Soares, 2008) we only use the first
four months of each household’s interviews. For instance, for any given individual, if s/he
participated in all four interviews, she will contribute with three observations: the pairs of
interviews (1, 2), (2,3) and (3,4). If there was attrition and she did not complete the four
first interviews, we will have less contributions. We then pool all pairs of information into
one single dataset and discard individuals with missing employment status information on
one of both sequential periods. This leaves us with 5,505,985 observations in the dataset.



3We will focus on transition rates between employment statuses considering two consecutive
months. Thus, to assess the period from January, 2003 to December, 2014 we used observations since
December, 2002.

                                                                                                4
For the objective of this paper, we must also examine carefully the impact of response
errors. To put it shortly, response errors occur whenever the interviewed member of the
household misreports the labor status of any of the other inhabitants of the household (see
Zylberstajn, 2015; Abowd and Zellner, 1985; Smith, 2011; Gomes, 2015). As Smith (2011)
and Gomes (2015) point out, this error can be particularly relevant for our study, since they
create spurious transitions. In our case, the most relevant cases of misreporting are answers
regarding to formal and informal work and out of labor force and unemployed status. For
instance, it is common to find in the data individuals who are reported as informal workers
in a given month, than in formal employment in the subsequent month and back to informal
in the next period, but on the same time with long employment spells recorded in every
interview (and thus with an inconsistent employment history). Because of the way formal
employment is defined (the employer must sign each workers carteira de trabalho; if she
does not sign, than the job relation is considered informal), the interviewed member might
not have perfect information on the member of interest’s carteira status (remember that in
each round the respondent might change) and be confused or mistaken when answering
the survey. Thus, the likelihood of misreporting formal/informal employment might be
high. The same holds for every other employment status, including unemployment and non-
participation.

We follow the correction algorithm proposed by Zylberstajn (2015) to address the
misreporting issue. By adopting this procedure, we corrected 7.92% of individuals’ labor
status (a total of 435,785 observations). This apparently small share of response error
actually decreased average transitions significantly, and has caused a decrease of
approximately 1 percentage point in the average unemployment rate for 2003:01 to
2014:12 (see Table 1 and Table 2). Smith (2011), also faces a similar pattern depending on
the method adopted for the correction. We refer the reader to Zylberstajn (2015) for details
on the correction procedure. Whenever we present results throughout the paper, we will
always show the results for both the corrected and original data. Often, the results do not
change significantly. What is most important is that there is a substantial commonality
across the corrected and original series.

We are interested in the information on each individual’s employment status. Originally, we
would observe in the data seven possible classifications: out of the labor force (OLF),
unemployed, unpaid worker, self-employed, employer, informal employee and formal
employee. We grouped the categories by reclassifying the unpaid workers as OLF, self-
employed and informal employees as informal employment and employers and formal
employees as formal employment. This is important for the four-state model we describe in
section 4, which accounts for OLF, unemployment and formal and informal employment
only.

An interesting test is to compare the average transition rates for Brazil with those reported
by Gomes (2015) for the US, based on CPS data. Results for the transitions involving
employment (E, considering both formal and informal as one status), unemployment (U)
and inactivity (I) are shown in Table 2. It is interesting to note that after correcting for
response error we have obtained smaller values and volatilities for the transition
probabilities (as would be expected), and the US serves as a good benchmark (remember
that there is no response error correction in the US estimates).

Figure 2 displays the observed separation and finding rates and the transition rates into and
out of inactivity. The top left panel shows that the transition rate U→I has been rising since
2005, while the job finding rate has risen between 2006 and 2012, and declined afterwards.
Other important trends are the continuous decline in the separation rates (i.e. the
transitions E→U and E→I) and the sharp fall in the transitions rates I→U during the entire
analyzed period. Finally, the decline in transitions from inactivity into employment after
2012 is also worth noting. We can state that 2012 seems to be a turning point in the
movements of some relevant transition rates.

One important feature of developing economies is the presence of a large informal sector in
the labor market. As Figure 3 shows, transitions into and out of formal employment have
evolved in remarkably different paths when compared to transitions into and out of
informal employment. If we followed the standard methodology of the literature and
focused only on the traditional three states (considering employment as a whole), the
relevant interactions between formality and informality would be missed.

Figure 3 breaks down the same transitions shown in Figure 2, but it considers formal and
informal employment as two different states (we consider self-employment as informal and
employers as formal employment). For instance, the transition U→E has two distinct
dynamics when the formal-informal dichotomy is considered (bottom left panel). The
difference may be observed comparing top left panel of Figure 3. The informal job finding
rate has been falling since 2006 and is still following this trend, whereas the formal job
finding rate rose sharply since 2006 but since 2012 is rising by a smaller pace. Similar
patterns are exhibited by other transitions: formal and informal employment have trailed
opposing paths in the last decade. This is particularly relevant because, as we will show, the
formalization of the labor market accounts for a large share of the decline in the
unemployment rate.

3. Using flows to assess unemployment dynamics

We begin describing a two-state model of employment status exactly as Petrongolo and
Pissarides (2008) and Smith (2011). At any time t individuals can either be employed (Et)
or unemployed (Ut). The unemployment rate is, by definition, ut = Ut / (Ut + Et) and evolves
according to:

                                                                  𝑢̇ 𝑡 = 𝑠𝑡 𝑒𝑡 − 𝑓𝑡 𝑢𝑡 = 𝑠𝑡 (1 − 𝑢𝑡 ) − 𝑓𝑡 𝑢𝑡                                                                                    (1)


where 𝑒𝑡 is the employment rate, 𝑓𝑡 is the job finding rate and 𝑠𝑡 is the separation rate at
time t (or, respectively, the instantaneous time unemployment outflow and inflow rates). In
steady state 𝑢̇ 𝑡 = 0, so the unemployment rate can be expressed as:


                                                                                                        𝑠𝑡                                                                                       (2)

The advantage of using this expression to calculate the unemployment rate is that one can
decompose changes in the unemployment rate according to changes in the inflow or outflow
rates.

In order to account for inactivity, we continue to follow both Petrongolo and Pissarides
(2008), Smith (2011) and also Shimer (2012). In a three-state world where individuals can
also be out of the labor force (I), the dynamics of each state can be described by the following
equations:

                              𝑈̇𝑡 = 𝜆𝐸𝑈      𝐼𝑈       𝑈𝐸   𝑈𝐼

                                     𝑡 𝑈𝑡 + 𝜆𝑡 𝐼𝑡 − (𝜆𝑡 + 𝜆𝑡 )𝐸𝑡                           (4)

where 𝜆𝑡𝐴𝐵 describes the transition rate at time t between states A and B.

In steady state, 𝑈̇𝑡 = 𝐸̇𝑡 = 0, so we can rearrange (3) and (4) and express 𝑈𝑡 as a function of
𝑁𝑡 and the transition probabilities:

               (𝜆𝐼𝐸 𝑈𝐸   𝐼𝐸 𝑈𝐼   𝐼𝑈 𝑈𝐸        𝐼𝑈 𝐸𝐼   𝐼𝑈 𝐸𝐼   𝐼𝐸 𝐸𝑈

Recalling that ut = Ut / (Ut + Et), we can express the steady state unemployment rate only in
terms of the six transitions rates:

The expression above is essentially similar to equation (2). The numerator accounts for the
separation rates from employment to unemployment and to inactivity, but the latter needs
to be ‘rescaled’ in order to have its impact in the unemployment rate appropriately
measured. The same rationale applies to the finding rate, which now should be thought of
as the share of unemployed that leaves unemployment (either to employment or to
inactivity).

Using the measures of the transition rates described in the previous section, we are now
able to construct a series for the steady state unemployment rate, as depicted in Figure 4.
The adopted method replicates well the actual unemployment rate: the correlation between
the actual and the steady state unemployment rates is 0.965.

Note: Steady state unemployment is calculated according to Eq. (7) using the six monthly transition rates
derived from PME (IBGE) data and corrected for response error as described in Zylberstajn (2015).




We follow Shimer (2012) to measure the contribution of the changes in each of the
transition rates to the change in the unemployment rate. The method is simple: first, we
construct the hypothetical unemployment rate using equation (7) holding every transition
rate constant (and equal to their historical average), allowing only the transition of interest
to change. For instance, the hypothetical unemployment rate had only the transition E→U
changed is given by:

where 𝜆̅𝐴𝐵 is the average transition rate A→B between January 2003 and December 2014.
We do this for every transition rate between the three states 𝑢𝑡𝐸𝑈 , 𝑢𝑡𝐸𝐼 , 𝑢𝑡𝑈𝐸 , 𝑢𝑡𝑈𝐼 , 𝑢𝑡𝐼𝐸 , 𝑢𝑡𝐼𝑈 .
This exercise yields the series shown in Figure 5.

Clearly, the main drivers of the decline in unemployment in the past decade were the decline
in the E→U (panel c) and in the I→U (panel e) movements. On the other hand, it is worth
noting that the job finding rate (U→E and I→E transitions, panels b and f) have both recently
contributed to an increase in unemployment, even though this contribution has been offset
by the movements in the other transition probabilities and we have not seen unemployment
rise (at least not until the end of 2014).

defined in equation (7) and 𝑢𝑡𝐴𝐵 is defined in equation (8). Notice that 𝛽𝐴𝐵 is the coefficient
of the regression of the hypothetical unemployment on the steady state unemployment
rate4. The results of this decomposition are shown in Table 35.

The first column of the table below shows each 𝛽 for the entire period (2003-2014), without
any correction to the data. The second column shows the results after correcting for
response bias and will be the subject of our analysis. The results confirm what we described
based on the visual inspection we had done when analyzing Figure 5: transitions from
employment into unemployment (inflows) contributed to roughly 48% of the decline in
unemployment, whereas transitions from inactivity into unemployment accounted for
approximately 27%. The third most relevant transition was U→E, which contributed to 13%
to the change in the unemployment rate, but this contribution was partially offset by the
I→E movements (-5%). Results do not change significantly if we don’t correct for response
bias, except for the contribution of I→U, which is higher in the original (uncorrected) data.
We argue that this result is both expected and imprecise, because a share of these
transitions are spurious.

In short, the results for the three-state model highlight two key factors that explain the
decline in the unemployment rate between 2003 and 2014 in Brazil. First, contrary to what
Shimer (2012) documented for the US, the ‘ins win’ in Brazil: inflows into unemployment
were more relevant to explain the unemployment rate movements in the past decade than
the outflows (given by job finding rates). Given that in this period there was a significant
decline in unemployment, an appropriate expression for this phenomenon would be
employment hoarding, a situation where workers are less likely to move into

4 This is not an exact decomposition; the sum of all betas for the entire period 2003:1 – 2014:12 is
0.970.
5 Other authors, such as Petrongolo and Pissarides (2008), adopt a slightly different approach. They

decompose ∆ut into ∆st and ∆ft and only then apply the beta approach to the ∆ series. This method
does not measure the contribution of each of the transitions to ∆ut; rather, it yields the contribution
of each of the transition rates variation to the unemployment rate volatility. Even though they clarify
what they are measuring, other papers that followed (such as X and Y) seem to miss the difference.

                                                                                                            12
unemployment. It is worth mentioning that employment hoarding is different from job
hoarding: an increase in the attachment to employment does not (necessarily) mean that
the attachment to the same job increased (in fact, as Chapter 2 shows, job turnover
increased dramatically, i.e. job-to-job transitions increased). It means only that workers are
less prone to return to the condition of being unemployed.

Second, the decrease in the participation rate that happened through less frequent
movements into the workforce, also played a key role in the unemployment rate movement.
These two phenomena are perhaps two sides of the same coin: if there are less persons
entering the workforce, those who want to work will be more likely to be employed, or
perhaps if workers have increased their attachment to employment, there is less room for
new entrants (we cannot establish any causality).



4. Accounting for informality

We now propose a model with for states. In this specific application, we consider state 0
(N0) to be formal employment and state 1 (N1) to be the informal sector, while
unemployment (U) and inactivity (I) are the other possible positions. It is worth mentioning
that in advanced economies the differentiation might also be useful in other labor market
dimensions, such as part-time and contingent work.

The procedure is the same as before. Unemployment, formal and informal employment and
inactivity evolve according to:

Note: Steady state unemployment is calculated according to Eq. (7) for the 3-state model and Eq. (17) for
the 4 state-model, using the monthly transition rates derived from PME (IBGE) data after correcting for
response bias. The correlation between both steady state series is 0.999.

Once again we follow Shimer (2012) and replicate the procedure from the previous section
to measure the contribution of the changes in each of the transition rates to the change in
the unemployment rate. We now have twelve hypothetical unemployment rates: 𝑢𝑡0𝑈 , 𝑢𝑡0𝐼 ,
        𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡 , 𝑢𝑡 and 𝑢𝑡 , where we remind that 0 refers to formal

employment and 1 refers to informal employment. The series are shown in Figure 7.

In Section 3, our results showed that the transitions from unemployment into employment
contributed little to the change in the unemployment rate (roughly 13%), i.e. the job finding
rate did not play a key role to explain the decline in unemployment. Moreover, the key



                                                                                                        14
conclusion was that the inflow into unemployment from employment was the most relevant
factor for the decline in the unemployment rate.

With the four-state model, however, we conclude differently as Figure 7 and Table 4 show.
First, the transition that contributed the most to the change in the unemployment rate is
I→U, suggesting that the participation rate played a key role in the unemployment rate
dynamics. The second most relevant contribution comes from U→Formal, i.e. the formal job
finding rate. Remember that in the previous section the (aggregate) job finding was not
especially relevant, but this was actually the aggregation of three different and large effects:
First, the U→Formal movements accounted for 26% of the change in the unemployment
rate, and this was because the formal job finding rate increased between January/2003
(3.6%) and December/2014 (5.7%). Second, U→Informal contributed with -20% to the
decline in unemployment, meaning that unemployment would have risen by a significant
amount due to the decline in the informal job finding rate. Third, we have the 15%
contribution to the decline in the unemployment rate from the transition Formal→Informal.

The reduction in the Formal→Informal transition probabilities and its contribution to the
unemployment reduction is a second-order effect, but with a high magnitude. The smaller
frequency at which a worker moves from formal to informal employment itself plays a key
role in the unemployment dynamics, possibly because once remaining formal, the likelihood
of becoming unemployed is much smaller (see Figure 3).

Our methodology does not allow to assess any causality, but these results indicate that
either unemployment fell because of the formalization that took place in the Brazilian labor
market, or conversely, the decline in unemployment induced the increase in the formal
share of the market. In any case, we can establish a strong correlation between
formalization and the reduction in the unemployment rate, which by itself is relevant for
policy-makers. Further research is necessary to clarify the mechanics behind this
phenomenon.

It is also worth pointing out that while Formal→U and U→Formal both contributed
positively to the decline in unemployment, the respective movements from and into
informal jobs have opposite signs. That is, in the formal sector it became both more likely to
find a job and to remain in employment, whereas in the informal sector it is now less likely
to find a job, but those that have one are more likely to keep it6.

We can therefore summarize the forces that led to changes in the Brazilian unemployment
rate between 2003 and 2014 in three main factors: (a) Employment hoarding, with 43% (the
sum of Informal→U, Informal→I, Formal→U and Formal→I); (b) Participation effect which
involves all transitions from and into inactivity but is well represented by the sum of I →U
and U→I contributions (both accounting to roughly 36%); and finally (c) Formal job finding
rate was very relevant with a total contribution of 32% (the sum of Informal→Formal,
U→Formal and I→Formal).




6We loosely interpret here the informal job exit rate as separation rates. It is worth pointing out that
we do not consider job-to-job flows, so using the term separation rate is imprecise. Still, the literature
employs such terms and we follow the same standard.

Notice that the magnitude of the contributions of the inflows from formal employment is
similar to the ones from the outflows. Thus, we can conclude that both inflows and outflows
are relevant to the changes in the unemployment rate. However, differently from what the
three-state model analysis indicated, the single most important contribution does not come
from the inflows from employment, but rather from inflows from inactivity.



5. Conclusion

This paper measures both formal and informal job finding rates, employment exit rates, and
inactivity’s inflow and outflow rates in Brazil from 2003 to 2014. Throughout this period,
the decline in the entrance of inactive persons in the workforce and the formalization of the
labor market were the main drivers of the decline in the unemployment rate. We found that
in particular the reduction of inflows into unemployment were determinant for this trend.

The main contribution of this paper is the extension of the tradition three-state model used
to study inflows and outflows contributions to changes in the unemployment rate. We
included a fourth state in the model, allowing the separation of employment into two
different forms. For instance, in developed countries, employment could be classified as full-
time or part-time/contingent work. In the developing world, a useful classification is
between formal and informal work.

In Brazil, we showed that formal and informal employment followed different paths and
that not accounting for this fact leads to incomplete conclusions: when looking at
employment as a whole, the most relevant flow that led the decline in unemployment was
the employment exit rate; however, we show that the formal job finding rate increased

                                                                                                         18
substantially, while the corresponding informal rate contributed negatively to the drop in
the unemployment rate. At the same time, both formal and informal employment exit rates
decreased, contributing further to the reduction of the unemployment rate. In sum, while in
the three-state approach, the job finding rate did not contribute much to explain the
variation in the unemployment rate, we have shown that the dynamics are much more
complex (as revealed with the four-state approach).

We must consider, however, that these findings do not allow to establish any causality, and
we do not present any theoretical framework to help us do that. Also, we need to take into
account that the data is available in Brazil for a short period of time (less than 15 years),
and given that this period was particularly positive for the labor market, results should not
be generalized without caution. Still, the evidence we presented helps to understand the key
movements in the Brazilian labor market during the past decade.
