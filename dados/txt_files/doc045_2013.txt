We analyze inflation persistence in several industrial and emerging countries in the
recent past by implementing unit root tests in the presence of unknown structural breaks
and by estimating reduced-form models of inflation dynamics. We select a very
representative group of 23 industrial and 17 emerging economies. Our sample period is
comprised of quarterly data and differs for each country. Our results indicate that
inflation persistence is decreasing over time for the great majority of industrial
economies. Many emerging economies, however, show increasing persistence. Even
some, such as Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Hungary and Check Republic, have highly
persistent inflationary processes. We also observe structural breaks in all inflation
processes we study with the exception of the inflation processes of Germany and
Austria. Our results are robust to different reduced forms of the inflation processes and
different econometric techniques.

1 Introduction
One of the most important characteristics of the dynamics of inflation is its degree of
persistence. It is related to how quickly inflation reverts to its initial level after a shock.
As Mishkin (2007) points out, if inflation is persistent, it increases the costs of monetary
policy (in terms of product or unemployment) to keep inflation under control.2

In the last years, both industrial and emerging economies have experienced important
changes in the degree of their inflationary persistence. As Cechetti et al (2007) show
both the volatility and level of inflation has decreased in industrial economies. In these
economies, the decades of 1960 and 1970 were considered periods of high and
persistent inflation, while the more recent decades, 1990 and 2000, have low levels of
inflation as well as low persistence.

Contrary to industrial countries, emerging economies have experienced high levels of
inflations for a longer period. Some of these countries, such as Brazil, Argentina,
Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, Israel, Poland and Turkey, have had periods of hyperinflation in
the last thirty years.3 Only recently, in the decade of 1990, the levels of inflation have
started to decrease in these countries. This, in part, is due to the important changes in
the conduct of their macroeconomic policies.4 However, it is not clear if the decrease of
the level of inflation has been accompanied by a reduction of their inflationary
persistence.

Our objective in this paper is to analyze empirically the inflation persistence of several
industrial and emerging countries in the recent past. We select a very representative
group of 23 industrial and 17 emerging economies. We want to answer the following
questions: Has inflation persistence decreased and been stable for industrial economies?
Has it decreased and been stable for emerging economies that had and had not
experienced hyperinflation in the recent past? 5678

2
  In a more formal way, we can define inflation persistence as the propensity of inflation to converge
slowly towards its long run equilibrium following a shock that has taken inflation away from this
equilibrium.
3
  To define a hyperinflation country, in the first place, we chose a sample of countries that had prolonged
periods of inflation over 15% a year. Then we looked at the recent monetary history of the country,
searched IMF country reports and anecdote facts about the country, so as to pinpoint a subsample of them
that we believe experienced hyperinflation episodes.
4
  As examples of some macroeconomic policies we can list: inflation targeting adoption, reduction of
budget deficits, improvement of financial regulation, trade liberalization and flexible exchange rate
policies among others. It is also important to add that for Latin American countries the renegotiation of
the external debt was a pre-condition and basis for inflation stabilization, particularly in Brazil.
5
  Our sample of emerging economies is Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic,
Hungary, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Slovak Republic, Thailand, and
Turkey. Our sample of industrial countries is: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, New
Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.
6
  See Stock and Watson (2003) for a brief analysis of monetary policy in some industrial countries in the
last years.
7
  Low persistence of inflation occurs when the parameter is significantly lower than 1. Stability means
that the persistence parameter is stable in a statistical sense across different subsamples of our data.
8
  Various factors can explain persistence: persistence may be inherited from persistent fluctuations in the
determinants of inflation, like marginal cost or output gap (this is called extrinsic persistence); the
dependence of inflation on its own past, also called intrinsic persistence and persistence due to the
formation of inflation expectations. Each one of this persistence can be associated with one of the three
terms of a new Keynesian Phillips curve.


                                                    2
Our results show that inflation persistence is decreasing over time for the great majority
of industrial economies in our sample. Many emerging economies in our sample,
however, show increasing persistence over time and even some, such as Argentina,
Peru, Bolivia, Hungary and Check Republic, have very persistent inflationary processes.
We also find that, with the exception of inflation in Germany and Austria, all others
inflation processes present structural breaks, which indicates that they have not been
stable through time.

To obtain our results, we first follow Perron et al (2009) and test for the presence of unit
roots in the inflation processes of all countries in our sample, taking in consideration
possible unknown structural breaks in these series.

For the countries in our sample period for which we reject the unit root, we estimate
several reduced models of inflation.9 The following types of models are estimated:
models with lags of inflation with and without GDP gap; new Keynesian Phillips
curves; and a model that is a reduced-form inflation dynamics of structural models that
incorporates some form of wage rigidity in the spirit of Blanchard and Gali (2005).

We use quarterly data of inflation, GDP and unemployment for each of our countries.
The sample period for each country differs, depending of the availability of these data.
For most countries, we have very long span of inflation data. For some we have almost
50 years of quarterly data.10

For many of the countries we consider, substantial shifts in monetary policy have
occurred over the past two decades. In the case of European countries, the introduction
of the Euro is a very important milestone. In the case of emerging economies, we can
cite more sound macroeconomic policies including, for many of them, the choice of
inflation targeting as a framework for monetary policies.

Our results, in general, confirm the results of a vast literature that shows that inflation
persistence has been decreasing for industrial economies, such as: Dossche and Everaert
(2005), Taylor (1999), Altissimo et al (2006), Benati (2008) and Batini (2002).

Our paper contributes to the literature by looking at a greater and more diversified group
of countries, including several emerging ones, by considering a more recent period and
by estimating various inflation dynamics specifications, taking in consideration possible
unknown structural breaks in these dynamics.11
9
 We also look at the inflations correlograms and decompose all inflation series in trend and cycle. Both
analysis, in general terms, confirm the results we present in this paper.
10
   The following countries have inflation series starting at the second quarter of 1960: Australia, Canada,
Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, France, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United
States.
11
    Other papers look at how inflation persistence has evolved over time also estimating reduced form
inflation processes. For example, Mishkin (2007) studies inflation persistence in the United States in the
last 40 years, using auto regressive models and decomposing inflation in cycle and trend as in Stock and
Watson (2006). Mishkin confirms the results of Stock and Watson (2006), showing that inflation
persistence is decreasing worldwide since the 1990s, compared with persistence observed in the 1960 and
1970s. Nason (2006) describes the dynamics of inflation in the United States with several different
models of inflation and confirms the results of Mishkin (2007) and Stock and Watson (2006) that
inflation persistence is decreasing in the United States in the last years. Rudd and Whelan (2005) estimate
a new Keynesian hybrid Phillips curve with lags in inflation and show that inflation persistence in the
United States is decreasing and is much more backward-looking than forward-looking. Fuhrer (2005) also

The rest of the paper is the following. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents
the empirical analysis. Section 4 concludes.
2. Data
Our data are quarterly and differs depending on the country. We select 40 countries: 23
industrial and 17 emerging. Our data source is the International Financial Statistics of
the International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price
Index inflation, CPI. We use as exogenous the following variables: the GDP gap, which
is the difference between nominal GDP and potential GDP obtained through Hodrick-
Prescott filtering and the unemployment rate.

For the purpose of our analysis, we separate our sample of countries in three groups:
one group is comprised of industrial countries (Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States), emerging countries that did not
experienced “hyperinflation” in the recent past (Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic,
Hungary, Korea, Philippines, South Africa, Slovak Republic and Thailand), and
emerging economies that have had hyperinflation recently in our view, such as
Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, Turkey, Israel and Poland.

Table 1 Panel A shows the sample periods for the inflation series of all countries we
analyze. For several of them, the sample period starts at the second quarter of 1960. The
countries in which the samples periods are lower are lower are Czech Republic and
Slovak Republic, in which the data starts at the second quarter of 1993.
Table 1 Panel B shows the sample periods for the GDP of all countries in our sample.
For most countries, the series of GDP are much smaller than the series of inflation. In
the case of unemployment, as Table 1 Panel C shows the sample are even much shorter
than both the samples of inflation and GDP for almost all countries except for the
United States, where the series starts in the first quarter of 1960.

In Table 2, we present descriptive statistics of the inflation processes. Table 2 Panel A 1
shows that average quarterly inflation in industrial economies is 1.24% and that the
average standard deviation is 1.30%. The country with the highest average inflation is
Portugal, 2.42%, and with the highest standard deviation is Iceland with 2.89%.

Table 2 Panel B shows descriptive statistics of inflation for the group of emerging
economies that did not have hyperinflation episode in the last thirty years. One can see
that average inflation is 2.08% and average standard deviation is 2.07%. The economy
with the highest average inflation is Colombia, 3.67%, and with the highest standard
deviation is Hungary, 2.85%.

Table 2 Panel C shows descriptive statistics of inflation for the group of emerging
economies that experienced a hyperinflation episode in the last thirty years. We can see
that average inflation is 10.45% and average standard deviation is 20.72%. The


models inflation using a hybrid Keynesian Phillips curve. He separates persistence in two types: one
related to the dynamics of the output gap and the other to marginal cost and that depends on lags of
inflation. Fuhrer shows that the more relevant part of inflation in the last years is due to intrinsic inflation
and not to output gap.

economy with the highest average inflation and standard deviation is Brazil, 23.78%,
and 35.88% respectively.

It is clear from Table 2 Panel B that inflation is higher in emerging economies that have
had hyperinflation in the recent past. The average inflation in these economies is 9.03%
higher than average inflation in the industrial economies and 8.37% higher than average
inflation in emerging economies that did not have hyperinflation. Not only the average
inflation, but also volatility is much higher in the emerging with hyperinflation when
compared with the other economies in our sample.

In the next section, we will present our empirical analysis of inflation persistence based
on unit root tests in the presence of unknown structural breaks and the estimation of
reduced form inflation dynamics for the groups of countries in our sample.
3. Empirical Analysis
3.1 Unit Root Tests
The overall degree of inflation persistence can be measured in several ways. The results
reported in this section are based on the methods that are most frequently used in the
literature. In order to show how fast inflation returns back to its mean following a
disturbance, or its persistence, we measure the dependence of inflation on its past
values.

As it is well known, a process that has a unit root is a highly persistent one. To verify if
any of our inflation processes has a unit root and structural breaks, we follow two steps.
In the first step, we test for the presence of a unit root with Aumengted Dick Fueller,
ADF tests, and for the presence of structural breaks with Quandt-Andrews and
Andrews-Ploberg (1994).12 Only in the case of the inflation processes of Germany and
Austria, we reject the null of a unit root as well as the presence of structural breaks.13

In the second step, following Perron (2009) we test for the presence of a unit root in the
presence of unknown structural breaks for all inflation processes with the exception of
Germany and Austria. Perron allows for the possibility of an unknown structural break
both for the Hypotheses of a unit root process, the null Hypotheses, as well as for the
Hypotheses of stationary process, the alternative Hypotheses.

 In all our tests, we consider the possibility of an unknown structural break both at the
intercept and at the trend. To allow for the possibility of various structural breaks, we
use rolling samples.

Table 3 presents the results. In the case of some emerging economies- Argentina, Peru,
Bolivia, Hungary and Check Republic - we accept the null hypothesis of a unit root in
the presence of unknown structural breaks. For all other inflation processes, we reject
the null.
3.2 Auto Regressive Processes

For all other inflation dynamics in which we reject the unit root in the presence of
unknown structural breaks, we estimate reduced form specifications. We will explore

12
  We use the trimmings 10%, 15%, 25% and 35% for the Quandt-Andrews and Andrews-Ploberg tests.
13
  In the case of Austria, the p-value of the ADF test is 0.083 and in the case of Germany the p-value of
the ADF is 0.00.


                                                    5
several possibilities. They range from autoregressive dynamics to different
specifications of new Keynesian Phillips curves.

One these possibilities, which is one of the most obvious way of measuring inflation
persistence is to regress inflation on several of its lags as in equation (1) and then
calculate the sum of coefficients on lagged inflation. If the sum of coefficients is close
to 1, then shocks to inflation have long lived effects on inflation. The higher the sum of
the coefficients of inflation lags, the longer it takes for inflation to return back to its
mean, or the more persistent is the inflationary process.

(1) π t = β 0 + β 1π t −1 + ∑ φ k π t − k + ε t , E[ε t ] = 0, var(ε t ) = σ ε2 ,

where π t is headline consumer inflation.
To the extent that lagged inflation captures true persistence in the price setting process
the model implies that rapid reductions of inflation can only be produced at the cost of
substantial increase in unemployment or decrease in product. Hence, the model points
to a gradualist approach as providing the best way to effect a large reduction in
inflation.

An equivalent approach for analyzing persistence (and the one we will follow in this
paper) is to estimate ρ in equation (2) as Reilly and Whelan (2005) show.


                     D                          D

(2)
      π t = β0 +    ∑ d j + ρπ t −1 + ∑ ρd j πt −1 + ∑ φk ∆πt − k + εt , .
                    j =1                       j =1
      E[ε t ] = 0, var(ε t ) = σ ε2

There are a number of good reasons for focusing on ρ as our main measure of inflation
persistence. For example, in this model, ρ is a crucial determinant of the response to
shocks over time. It can also be shown that 1/(1-ρ) gives the infinite-horizon cumulative
impulse response to shocks.

In equation (2), we also use as regressors level dummies and dummies interacting with
the first lag of the inflation process.14 The dummies for most countries indicate
structural breaks that we observe with the Perron (2009) unit root tests. However for a
few countries the dummies of structural breaks are found using Quandt-Andrews with
rolling samples.15




14
   Dummies are represented by d and D is to total of dummies indicating a structural break that varies
depending on each country.
15
   The countries for which we include other dummies indicating other structural breaks different from
those that we obtain with Perron (2009) are: Chile, Israel, Mexico and Netherlands. We analyse the
inflation process of these countries graphically and also look at possible economic reasons for a break and
consider that for these countries the break Perron found are not structural in nature. So we use quandt-
Quandt to find other breaks that we think make more sense in economic terms.


                                                          6
We choose the number of lags of first difference of headline consumer inflation in (2)
so as the residuals do not present serial correlation, using LM test to identify serial
correlation. We also check for heteroskedasticity with White and Breush-Pagan. If there
is evidence of heteroskedasticity, we correct it with the Newey-West robust errors. We
do a Wald test of ρ=1 for all estimations of the traditional models and we rejected ρ=1
for all estimations.

Table 4 Panel A shows the estimated ρ for this specification for industrial economies
including the dummies of structural breaks. The majority of industrial countries (78%)
show decreasing persistence over time, as one can see.16 For all industrial countries, we
reject the null hyphoteses of sum of the persistence coefficients equal to one.

Tabel 4 Panel B shows the estimation of equation (2) for emerging economies. As one
can see, some countries like Chile, Israel, Mexico, Poland, Turkey and Slovak Republic
show increasing persistence. Of these, Turkey and Poland are hyperinflation countries.
The other hyperinflation countries show decreasing persistence. This is the case of
Brazil for instance.17Once more, we reject the null hypotheses of sum of the persistence
coefficients equal to one.

We repeat the estimation above including in equation (2) the output gap calculated
using Hodrick-Prescot filter. Again, we test for serial correlation, heteroskedasticity,
and in their presence we correct using Newey-West.

The results for the industrial economies are very similar to the ones described above
(see Table 5 Panel A). However for emerging economies, the results differ somewhat
from the previous ones. No emerging economy presents increasing persistence. We
think that this result has to do with fact that our series of GDP for each country is
shorter than the series of inflation for most countries in our sample, particularly for
emerging ones. Therefore, we believe that the results that we present in Table 4 are
more representative of the inflation dynamics of these emerging economies.

To capture if monetary policy has anchored inflation expectations more solidly in the
last years, that could have important implication to inflation persistence we will
estimate in the following section new Keynesian models of inflation that incorporate
inflation expectations.

3.3 New Keynesian Phillips Curves Estimation
The most important implication of the pure new Keynesian model of inflation is that
there is no intrinsic persistence in inflation in the sense that there is no structural
dependence of inflation on its own lagged values. Instead, inflation is determined in a
completely forward-looking manner. One implication of this model in contrast to
traditional ones is that it is much easier to quickly reduce inflation in this model than in




16
   This can be observed by the looking at the sum of the persistent coefficients alone and interacting with
dummies of structural breaks.
17
   We compare the average of persistence coefficient of the three groups by doing Wald tests in a system
of equations estimated with OLS in which each equation is the same one we estimated individually.


                                                     7
the traditional one. In fact, according to the new Keynesian model, inflation can be
costless controlled by a credible commitment to keep output close to its potential. 18

Due to the difficulty of fitting the data with new Keynesian pure forward-looking
model, a vast literature that incorporates lags of inflation in the new Keynesian Phillips
curve (NKPC) has emerged19. For many, this class of models represents a sort of
common-sense middle ground that preserves the insights of standard rational
expectations models while allowing for better empirical fit by dealing directly with a
well known deficiency of the pure forward looking model of inflation. As a result this
class of models has been widely used in applied monetary policy analysis.

The structural equation for inflation that we estimate is in the spirit of hybrid new
Keynesian Phillips curve as in (3). These models add a dependence of inflation on its
lagged values to otherwise purely forward looking models. Such models are often
considered as a compromise between the need for rigorous micro foundations of the sort
underlying the pure new-Keynesian Phillips curve and the need to fit the data
empirically.

                 D                               D
     π   t   =   ∑   d   j   + ρπ   t −1     +   ∑      ρ   d j π t − 1 ρπ t − 1       +

     E [ ε t ] = 0 , var( ε t )     = σ 2ε
where ht is output gap and Xt is foreign exchange rate.


The parameter that measures inflation persistence is ρ . Again, we interact this
parameter with dummies indicating structural breaks (d are the dummies and D is the
total number of dummies).

We use two different instruments for the expectation of inflation one period ahead. One
instrument is the lag of current inflation. The other instrument is the residual of the
inflation equation of a VAR with inflation and GDP gap as dependent variables. In this
case, the number of lags is chosen using Akaike information criteria.

We also check for serial correlation with LM test and for heteroskedasticity with White
test. In the presence of serial correlation, we include more lags of regressors, until there
is no more evidence of serial correlation. In the presence of heteroskedasticity, we
corrected with Newey-West robust matrix.

18
   The most popular formulation of the new Keynesian framework is based on Calvo (1983) model of
price random adjustment. The model assumes that in each period a random fraction of firms reset their
price while all other firms keep their prices unchanged. Calvo assumes an imperfectly competitive market
structure as well. These two hypotheses generate the basic new Keynesian model of inflation.
19
   See Fuhrer and Moore (1995), Gali and Gertler (1999) and Christiano et al (2005) for some theoretical
models that justify the inclusion of lags of inflation in the new Keynesian Phillips curves.


                                                   8
Table 6 Panels A and B shows the estimated persistence with the lag of current inflation
as an instrument for industrial and emerging economies respectively. Table 6 Panels C
and D shows the estimated persistence with the residuals of the inflation equation of the
VAR as instruments.

The results for estimations with both instruments are somewhat different from the ones
we find before. Very few industrial economies have the sum of the persistent
significant. For those that are significant, we observe a decrease in persistence. In the
case of emerging economies, the results are mixed. Some of these countries show
significant and increasing persistence while others have decreasing persistence. Again,
these results may be related to the very different sample periods of GDP data for all
countries, particularly for emerging ones.

After gauging all the empirical evidence that we present above- considering several unit
root tests with unknown structural breaks and the estimation of reduced form inflation
dynamics- we ponder that in general terms, our results show that most industrial
economies experience decreasing persistence over time, while in the case of emerging
economies some show deceasing, others show increasing and even some present highly
persistent inflationary processes.

In terms of macroeconomic policies, we think that these results are important for
emerging economies. Despite some recent improvements in macroeconomic policies in
some of these countries, inflation persistence is still an important issue for them. This
means that macroeconomic policies should continue to focus in targeting both low
levels and low volatilities of inflation in these countries to diminish the importance of
inflation persistence in the next years.

4. Conclusion
We analyze inflation persistence in several industrial and emerging countries in the
recent past by implementing unit root tests in the presence of structural breaks and by
estimating reduced-form models of inflation dynamics. We select a very representative
group of 23 industrial and 17 emerging economies.

Our results show that inflation persistence is mostly decreasing over time for the
industrial economies. Many emerging economies, however, show increasing persistence
over time and even some, such as Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Hungary and Check
Republic, have very persistent inflationary processes. We also find that all inflationary
processes present structural breaks in their sample periods, which indicates that they
have not been stable.

In interpreting our results, we must first recognize that all of them are based on reduced-
from relationships. Thus, they are about correlations and not necessarily about true
structural relationships. Explanatory variables in our inflation estimations are
themselves influenced by changes in economic conditions. So, changes in the
underlying monetary policy regime are likely to be a source changes in reduced-form
inflation dynamics. This problem is especially acute for structural relationship involving
expectations or other factors that are not directly observable and so cannot be included
in reduced form regressions. In such cases, we cannot use the reduced form equations to



                                            9
disentangle the effects of such unobserved factors which themselves may be driven by
changes in monetary policy from that of other influences.

Mishkin (2007) makes it clear that inflation expectations must be a key driving force
behind inflation. This dependence has long been implicit in traditional Phillips curve
analysis but now expectations are explicit and are also a central feature of new
Keynesian Phillips curves in which current period inflation is a function of expectations
next period and output gap.

Anchoring of inflation expectations must be related to monetary policy. During the past
years several central banks have increased their commitment to price stability in both
words and action. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other central
banks of industrial and some of emerging economies have been committed to keep
inflation under control.

For many emerging economies, however, our empirical evidence indicates that
anchoring of inflation expectations is problematic still because of high inflation
persistence that we observe in these economies. The increase of monetary policy
effectiveness in these countries thus is related to the capacity their central banks will
have to decrease inflation persistence in the next years.

the International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price
Index inflation, CPI. We use as exogenous the following variables: the GDP gap, which
is the difference between nominal GDP and potential GDP obtained through Hodrick-
Prescott filtering and the unemployment rate. Panel A presents the sample periods for
inflation. Panel B presents the sample periods for GDP and Panel C shows the sample
periods for unemployment.

Table 4 Autoregressive Processes of Inflation without Output Gap
Our data are quarterly and differs depending on the country. We select 40 countries: 23
industrial and 17 emerging. Our data source is the International Financial Statistics of
the International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price
Index inflation, CPI. Panel A presents the results of the estimation of equation (2) in the
text for industrial economies. Panel B presents the results of the estimation of equation
(2) in the text for emerging economies. Below the estimated persistent coefficients in
columns 1 to 3 of both panels A and B, we have a t statistic. In the last 2 columns of
both Panels A and B, we have p-values.

Table 5 Autoregressive Processes Estimation with Output Gap
Our data are quarterly and differs depending on the country. We select 40 countries: 23
industrial and 17 emerging. Our data source is the International Financial Statistics of
the International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price
Index inflation, CPI. We use as exogenous the following variables: the GDP gap, which
is the difference between nominal GDP and potential GDP obtained through Hodrick-
Prescott filtering and the unemployment rate. Panel A presents the results of the
estimation of equation (2) in the text for industrial economies with the inclusion of
output gap. Panel B presents the results of the estimation of equation (3) in the text for
emerging economies with the inclusion of output gap. Below the estimated persistent
coefficients in columns 1 to 3 of both panels A and B, we have a t statistic. In the last 2
columns of both Panels A and B, we have p-values.

Our data are quarterly and differs depending on the country. We select 40 countries: 23
industrial and 17 emerging. Our data source is the International Financial Statistics of
the International Monetary Fund. Our measure of inflation is headline Consumer Price
Index inflation, CPI. We use as exogenous the following variables: the GDP gap, which
is the difference between nominal GDP and potential GDP obtained through Hodrick-
Prescott filtering and the unemployment rate. Panel A presents the results of the
estimation of equation (3) in the text for industrial economies using the first lag of
inflation as an instrument. Panel B presents the results of the estimation of equation (3)
in the text for emerging economies using the first lag of inflation as an instrument.
Panel C presents the results of the estimation of equation (3) in the text for industrial
economies using the residual of an inflation equation of a VAR that also includes a
GDP equation as an instrument. Panel D presents the results of the estimation of
equation (3) in the text for emerging economies using the residual of an inflation
equation of a VAR that also includes a GDP equation as an instrument. Below the
estimated persistent coefficients in columns 1 to 3 of A, B, C and D we have a t statistic.
In the last 2 columns of Panels A, B, C and D we have p-values.
