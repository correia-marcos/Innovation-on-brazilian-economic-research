Abstract: This paper examines the importance of output growth and of research
intensity for productivity growth. Two hypotheses are tested. Firstly, the paper
investigates the impact of the two variables on productivity growth when
simultaneously considered, assessing whether the basic Kaldorian and Schumpeterian
models can be combined. Secondly, it examines whether research intensity impacts on
the magnitude of returns to scale, assessing if countries with higher research intensity
benefit from higher returns to scale. The tests reported in the paper provide strong
evidence of the importance of demand growth for productivity growth and of the
existence of increasing returns to scale in manufacturing, while also recognizing the
relevance of research intensity for productivity growth. Most importantly, the test
results suggest that research intensity has a more relevant impact on the magnitude of
returns to scale than directly on productivity growth.

Increasing Returns to Scale, Technological Catch-up and Research
Intensity: An Industry-level Investigation Combining EU KLEMS
Productivity Data with Patent Data

1. Introduction

Following Keynes’ (1936) demand-led approach, Kaldorian works emphasise the
importance of demand for productivity growth. The Dutch economist Petrus Verdoorn
(1949) was the first to observe that there is a positive relationship between output and
productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, it was Lord Kaldor
(1966) who brought attention to the relevance of this finding, pointing out that a
positive impact of output growth on productivity growth indicates the existence of
increasing returns to scale in the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, following Allyn
Young (1928), Kaldor (1966) emphasised that a considerable part of this impact
should be attributed to technical progress induced by expanding demand. After
Kaldor’s influential lecture in 1966, the relationship between output growth and
productivity growth, known as Kaldor-Verdoorn’s Law, was scrutinized and
elaborated further (see McCombie, 2002). Most importantly, a large number of
empirical works have found support to the law (e.g. McCombie and De Ridder, 1983;
1984; Angeriz et al, 2008; 2009).
        In parallel to the Kaldorian demand-led approach, however, Schumpeterian
works emphasise the importance of supply-side factors for technical progress. The
importance of research intensity for technical progress represents the main foundation
of Schumpeterian models of economic growth (e.g. Romer, 1990; Aghion and Howitt,
1992; 1998; Ha and Howitt, 2007; Madsen, 2008). According to Schumpeter (1943),
innovations create temporary monopolies, providing a strong incentive for firms to
invest in research and development (R&D) in pursuit of innovations. Moreover,
technological transfer is yet another determinant of productivity growth emphasised
by Schumpeterian works (e.g. Posner, 1961; Verspagen, 1991; Griffith et al, 2004;
Vanderbusche et al. , 2006). Transposing Schumpeter’s (1934; 1943) microeconomic
ideas on innovation and imitation to a macroeconomic setting, these works stress that
follower economies can benefit from their backwardness and increase productivity
growth through technological absorption, given that absorbing (imitating) foreign
technology is easier (cheaper) than creating innovations. Thus, the existence of
differences in productivity between countries opens up the opportunity for
technological transfer from frontier to follower countries, providing an interesting
explanation for conditional convergence.
        Given the strong theoretical and empirical foundations of these two influential
streams of thought, combining the two should contribute to a better understanding of
the dynamics involved in the process of productivity growth. In effect, the two
approaches present a certain degree of complementarity. While Kaldorian theory
emphasises the importance of demand growth for long-term growth, putting less
stress on the importance of supply-side factors, the opposite holds true for
Schumpeterian theory. Still, this difference does create an important difficulty, since
putting together these theories can subvert one of the two by attributing a final role to
either demand or to supply alone. Indeed, perhaps because of this difficulty, in spite
of the large number of Kaldorian and Schumpeterian works that have investigated the
determinants of productivity growth, there have been only a few attempts to reconcile
the two approaches (e.g. Léon-Ledesma, 2002). Most importantly, combining the

insights and evidence of these two streams of thought is not only relevant to assess
whether the variables considered in each of the traditions are still significant when the
two approaches are put together, but it is also crucial to better understand how
demand and supply-side factors interact to generate productivity growth.
        The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to assess the impacts of output growth
and research intensity on productivity growth. Two hypotheses are tested. Firstly, the
paper investigates whether the two variables have significant impacts on productivity
growth when simultaneously considered, assessing if the basic Kaldorian and
Schumpeterian models can be combined. Secondly, the paper examines whether
research intensity impacts on the degree of returns to scale, assessing if countries with
higher research intensity benefit from higher returns to scale. The intuition behind this
hypothesis is that higher research intensity generates higher knowledge, which allows
faster technical progress (or dynamic returns to scale) in response to output growth.
        The empirical investigation reported in this paper is based on disaggregated
data on patents and productivity not explored before. The data used to calculate the
growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) is from the EU KLEMS Database, and
comprises 12 manufacturing industries in up to 15 OECD countries over the period
1976-2006. The data on patents used to calculate research intensity for each country,
industry and year is from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO),
and was aggregated by industry using the methodology developed by Lybbert and
Zolas (2014). Thus, the investigation presented in this paper extends previous works
carried out using EU KLEMS data by incorporating innovation indicators into the
database, as suggested by O’Mahony and Timmer (2009: F396).
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the
model. Section 3 describes the empirical investigation and discusses the results.
Section 4 presents the concluding remarks.

2. The Model

2.1. Kaldor-Verdoorn’s Law

       Kaldor-Verdoorn’s Law postulates that faster output growth generates
productivity growth due to increasing returns. The law can be derived from a
production function like:

Y = A0 e gAt K α Lβ     !                                                 (1)

where Y is total value added, K is the stock of capital, L is labour, A is a constant and
gA is the rate of technological progress. Moreover, α and β are respectively the
output elasticities of capital and labour, so that (α + β ) = γ [α '+ (1− α ')] , where γ is a
measure of the degree of static returns to scale and α ' is the share of capital in total
value added (Angeriz et al., 2009).
         In contrast with the Schumpeterian growth models developed by Romer
(1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991) and Aghion and Howitt (1998), in the
Kaldorian approach it is demand growth that determines technological progress.
Hence, assuming the growth of factor inputs is driven by demand growth (i.e.
[α ' K̂ + (1− α ')L̂] = f (Yˆ ) ), a faster growth of weighted factor inputs induces a faster
rate of technical progress, so that:



!                                                                                           2!
gA = ϕ + η[α ' K̂ + (1− α ')L̂]                                                           (2)

where ϕ is the exogenous technical progress and η is the elasticity of induced
technological progress. The hats over the variables indicate growth rates.
        Thus, substituting equation (2) into the production function (1), taking
logarithms, differentiating with respect to time and rearranging gives the dynamic
demand-side Kaldor-Verdoorn Law:1

       !ϕ $ ! 1 $
TF̂P = # & + #1− &Yˆ                                                                      (3)
       " v % " v%

where v = γ + η !. The growth rate of TFP is defined as TF̂P ≡ Yˆ − TF̂I , where
TF̂I ≡ α ' K̂ + (1− α ')L̂ is the growth rate of Total Factor Inputs (TFI).
        Equation (3) indicates that productivity growth is determined by the growth of
value added, which is driven by the growth of demand in Kaldor’s approach. Thus, if
γ > 1 (i.e. β > 1− α ) there are static increasing returns to scale, while if η > 0 there
are dynamic increasing returns to scale. Consequently, if γ > 1 , or ηi > 0 , or both,
then the term between parentheses in equation (3) is above zero, which indicates the
existence of increasing returns. This specification is different from the original
specification of Kaldor-Verdoorn’s Law, which has labour productivity growth as the
dependent variable, due to the fact it takes explicit account of capital accumulation.

2.2. Expanded Kaldor-Verdoorn’s Law

        Notwithstanding the importance of demand for productivity growth, other
factors might influence the speed of productivity growth across countries and
industries.
        The Schumpeterian literature places considerable emphasis on the role played
by innovation in income growth (e.g. Nelson, 1993; Fagerberg, 1994; Freeman,
1995).2 In Schumpeterian growth models, research intensity is the main determinant
of productivity growth (see Madsen, 2008). 3 As Schumpeter (1943) stressed,
innovations create temporary monopolies, which provide a strong incentive for firms

to invest in R&D in pursuit of abnormal profits. The share of resources devoted to
research, therefore, becomes the key determinant of productivity growth in this
approach. It is important to note, however, that research intensity cannot increase
indefinitely, given that resources must be divided between research and production
(see Ha and Howitt, 2007). Consequently, when research intensity is held fixed,
technical progress can only increase if, for some reason, the productivity of research
increases. Yet, according to the Schumpeterian literature, the growth rate of technical
progress can be indefinitely positive, given that knowledge accumulation is assumed
to face constant marginal returns (Romer, 1990). This generates increasing returns to
scale, pushing economies towards divergence. As Young (1998) stressed, however,
product proliferation can offset these scale effects, which means knowledge
accumulation may not necessarily translate into higher productivity growth.
        Moreover, the Schumpeterian literature stresses also the importance of
technological transfer for productivity growth (e.g. Nelson and Phelps, 1966;
Fagerberg, 1987; 1988; Griffith et al., 2004; Acemoglu et al., 2006). This literature
emphasises that differences in productivity growth rates between countries can be
partially explained by the existence of technology gaps, which allow backward
countries to absorb foreign technology and grow at higher rates than advanced
countries.4 Indeed, controlling for technological transfer is now commonplace in the
Kaldorian literature (e.g. León-Ledesma, 2002; Angeriz et al., 2008; 2009), given that
it is crucial to avoid spurious correlation between output growth and productivity
growth (see McCombie, 1983; Bairam; 1987).
        A simple way of incorporating the Schumpeterian insights discussed above
into the model presented in the previous section is to introduce research intensity and
the technology gap as determinants of autonomous technical progress, so that
equation (2) becomes:

gA = ϕ + η[α ' K̂ + (1− α ')L̂]+ µT − σ Gt−1                                           (4)
                                                                !   !   !   !   !            !

where T is research intensity and G=TFP/TFPF is the technology gap, where the
subscript F denotes the leading economy in each particular industry.
       Thus, substituting equation (4) into equation (1) yields an expanded Kaldor-
Verdoorn’s Law:

       !ϕ $        !µ $    !σ $
TF̂P = # & + δYˆ + # & T − # & Gt−1                                                    (5)
       "v%         "v%     "v%

where δ = (1−1 / v) .
        Nonetheless, if research intensity fosters technical progress, then higher
research intensity should increase also the response of technical progress to output
growth, influencing the magnitude of returns to scale. The Verdoorn coefficient is
a measure of encompassing returns to scale, including induced technical progress,
internal economies of scale and the division of labour broadly defined. Thus, a higher
value of the coefficient reflects a greater effect of the growth of output in raising
(inducing) the growth of productivity. Consequently, assuming that research intensity
makes the industry’s productivity growth more responsive to demand growth, the

Verdoorn coefficient becomes positively related to the degree of research intensity.
Formally, this means that the Verdoorn coefficient δ in equation (5) becomes
endogenous, given by:

δ = ρ + εT !                 !              !              !    !   !   !    !         !          (6)

              Thus, substituting (6) into (5) yields:

       !ϕ $ !σ $              !µ $
TF̂P = # & − # & Gt−1 + ρYˆ + # & T + εTYˆ                                                       (7)
       "v% "v%                "v%

        Equation (7) indicates that productivity growth depends not only on output
growth and on the technology gap, but that it also depends on the interaction between
output growth and research intensity. Hence, this means that countries with higher
levels of research intensity benefit from higher increasing returns when output grows.
        In this model, therefore, research intensity is assumed to be an exogenous
variable. Schmookler (1966) has found evidence of a strong relationship between
investment in capital goods user industries and patent applications by capital goods
producing industries, which suggests that patenting is a function of effective demand
(“demand pull” hypothesis). However, this finding is not free from problems. For
example, in a re-examination of Schmookler’s findings using data from the Dutch
economy, Kleinknecth and Verspagen (1990: 394) found evidence of a mutual
dependence between demand and innovations, which suggests that not only demand
may favour innovation, but also innovation may induce extra demand. Moreover, in
León-Ledesma’s (2002) tests, demand has no significant contemporaneous impact on
research intensity.


3. Empirical Investigation

3.1. Econometric Specification

       Similarly to Griffith et al. (2004), the regressions reported in this chapter were
estimated using panel data models for industries i in countries j at time t. 5 A
preliminary investigation was carried out to assess the basic Kaldorian and
Schumpeterian models, and then equations (5) and (7) were tested. The estimated
regressions were:

TF̂Pijt = β0 − β1Yˆijt + uijt                                                                    (8)

         There are three econometric issues involved in estimating these equations.
First, it is necessary to control for unobserved fixed effects (FE). Second, it is also
necessary to control for possible measurement errors in the variables, especially TFP
and research intensity. Third, it is necessary to deal with endogeneity due to
simultaneity between the dependent variable and: (i) the technology gap, given that
TF̂Pijt = lnTFPijt − lnTFPijt−1 and lnGijt−1 = lnTFPijt−1 − lnTFPFjt−1 ; (ii) the growth rate of
value added, given that TF̂Pijt = Yˆijt − TF̂I ijt ; (iii) research intensity, since higher
productivity growth can generate more resources to be invested on research.
        In the tests reported in this paper, these problems were addressed employing
the System General Method of Moments (SYS-GMM) approach of Blundell and
Bond (2000). This method, which has been used in a number of studies (e.g. Baltagi
et al., 2000; Griffith et al., 2006), employs a system of equations in levels and in
differences to estimate the parameters, using as instruments the lags of the variables
in differences and in levels, respectively (see Roodman, 2009a: 114). This estimator is
a Two-Step Feasible Efficient System GMM estimator, which controls for fixed
effects via first differences. The two-step approach is used to obtain a feasible
efficient GMM estimator, given that GMM is inefficient in the presence of
heteroskedasticity. In the first step a Two-Stage Least Square (2SLS) is regressed.
The residuals from the first stage are then employed to form the weighting matrix that
is used to eliminate heteroskedasticity, while in the second step the parameters are
estimated satisfying the orthogonality conditions of the instruments, i.e. minimizing
the L moment conditions E[Zijt uijt ] = 0 , where Z is the matrix that contains the L
included and excluded instruments. However, the identification of the parameters
using the System GMM estimator not only requires overidentification, tested using
Hansen’s J Test, but requires also no autocorrelation, which is tested using Arellano
and Bond’s (1991) Autoregressive (AR) Test.6

3.2. Data description

       Kaldor-Verdoorn’s Law was estimated using data from the EU KLEMS
Database. The sample used comprises up to 15 OECD countries (Australia, Austria,
Czech Rep., Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal,
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, USA, and the United Kingdom), for which data on value
added, capital stock, and number of hours worked by persons engaged is consistently
available for 12 manufacturing industries over the period 1976-2006 (see O’Mahony
and Timmer, 2009). Capital stock is the most restrictive variable in the database
(O’Mahoney and Timmer, 2009: F401), and therefore guides the selection of the
countries and time periods adopted in this paper’s investigation. To assess the
consistency of the data, the value added accounting identity was checked for each
industry, year and country (see Felipe et al., 2008).
       The 12 industries were split into two samples following the OECD
technological classification. The first sample, henceforth called low-tech industries,
comprises 5 low-tech industries (Food, Textiles, Wood, Paper and Other
Manufactures) plus 3 medium-low-tech industries (Plastics, Minerals and Metals).

        Data on real value added and capital stocks in 1995 US dollars, labour shares,
and number of hours worked by persons engaged were used to calculate TFP growth
rates.8 Variables in constant 1995 prices were transformed from national currencies to
1995 US dollars using industry-specific PPPs from the Groningen Growth and
Development Centre (GGDC) Productivity Level Database (Inklaar and Timmer,
2008).9
        The technology gap was calculated as:10

        Finally, the ratio of patents to the number of millions of hours worked by
persons engaged was used as a measure of research intensity in each country j,
industry i and period t.11 It is common to use patent data gathered from a single patent
office to avoid differences in patent legislations between countries (see Soete, 1981;
Nagaoca et al., 2010). USPTO is normally the most common choice, given that the
US has the biggest market in the world, so that most high-value patents are registered
there. Patents registered at the USPTO were gathered individually, and the first 4
digits of the respective International Patent Classification (IPC) codes were extracted
from each patent registration along with the country of origin of the first author of the
patent and the year the patent was granted. 12 Collecting information from each
individual patent from the USPTO allowed employing the correspondence table

3.3. Main Results

        Table 1 presents the results of the basic Kaldorian and Schumpeterian models,
as in equations (8) and (9). Columns (i) to (iii) present the results found using OLS,
while columns (iv) to (vi) present the estimates found employing SYS-GMM. In all
the models Hansen’s J test indicates the instruments are valid at the 10% level of
significance, while Arellano and Bond’s (1991) AR test indicates that there is not
autocorrelation in the lags used as instruments. All the variables are significant and
with the expected signs. As expected, the technology gap has a negative impact on
TFP growth. This impact, however, is small in all the models, and only significant in
3 of the 6 regressions, indicating that the gap is not very relevant in the sample
analysed.

        Columns (i) and (iv) report tests of the basic Schumpeterian model. The
results indicate that research intensity has a positive and significant impact on TFP
growth. The magnitude of the variable is slightly lower than the 0.03 to 0.09
coefficients commonly found in the literature (see Griliches, 1990; Madsen, 2008;
Chang et al., 2013).
        Columns (ii) and (v), in turn, report tests of the basic Kaldorian model. The
results indicate that output growth has a positive and significant impact on TFP
growth. The magnitude of the coefficients is similar to some previous works (e.g.

Angeriz et al., 2008; 2009), but slightly higher than other studies (e.g. Tharnpanich
and McCombie, 2014). Thus, following Millemaci and Ofria (2014), the first lag of
output growth and of TFP growth were introduced to capture short-term effects. This
reduces the magnitude of the returns to scale to a level closer to the original estimates
of Kaldor (1966).
        Table 2, in turn, presents the results of regressing equations (10) and (11)
using both OLS and SYS-GMM. The OLS results, presented in columns (i) to (iv),
provide benchmark results to be compared with the estimates found using the robust
SYS-GMM, which are presented in columns (v) to (viii).
        Columns (i) and (v) report the estimates of equation (10). These results
indicate that both output growth and research intensity are significant determinants of
TFP growth, even when endogeneity due to fixed effects and simultaneity is
controlled for. In the SYS-GMM regression, the Hansen test and the Arellano-Bond
AR test indicate the validity of the instruments used. Interestingly, the returns to scale
found using SYS-GMM and introducing research intensity are much lower than the
returns to scale found using OLS. One possible explanation for this finding is that
movements in research intensity captures the short-term fluctuation of output,
bringing the returns to scale to a magnitude similar to the one found when controlling
for short-term movements in output and TFP growth, as presented in columns (iii) and
(vi) of Table 1.
        Columns (ii) and (vi) report the estimates of equation (11). Output growth and
the interaction term between output growth and research intensity are significant,
while research intensity alone is not significant in the SYS-GMM regression. This
corroborates the initial hypothesis, suggesting that the effect of research intensity on
productivity growth is indeed stronger when combined with output growth. In other
words, this finding indicates that although output growth generates productivity
growth through increasing returns to scale, when the country has higher research
intensity, the magnitude of the increasing returns is higher. In these regressions, the
long-term coefficient that links output growth to productivity growth can be
calculated using equation (6). Thus, taking into account that in the sample used the
average number of patents per millions of hours worked is 0.333, using this number
and the coefficients estimated it is possible to calculate the Verdoorn coefficient δ
using equation (6). From this coefficient it is possible to calculate the degree of
returns to scale v, given that δ = (1−1 / v) . The degree of returns to scale found in
column (v) of Table 2 is closer to degree found in column (vi) of Table 1, and not too
distant from the seminal estimates of Kaldor (1966).
        Columns (iii), (iv), (vii), and (viii), report the results of estimating equation
(11), but dividing the sample of sectors into low-tech and high-tech industries,
following the OECD classification. In both the OLS and the SYS-GMM regressions,
the magnitude of the coefficient of output growth is higher for high-tech industries.
Nonetheless, for the coefficient of the interaction between research intensity and
output growth, the magnitude is higher for high-tech industries when using OLS, but
similar to that of low-tech industries when using SYS-GMM. Hence, this result shows
that although high-tech industries enjoy higher returns to scale, the effect of research
intensity on productivity growth is roughly the same in both low-tech and high-tech
industries. Still, for low-tech industries, Hansen’s J Test rejects the validity of the
instruments at 5% level.

        Finally, using the parameters reported in columns (vii) and (viii) and the
average number of patents per millions of hours worked of the countries analysed as
the proxy for research intensity it is possible to estimate the changes in the magnitude
of increasing returns through time following equation (6). Research intensity
increased from an average number of patents per millions of hours worked of 0.09 in
1976 to 0.40 in 2006 in the low-tech sector, while in the high-tech sector in went from
0.22 to 1.08. This led to changes in returns to scale in these two sectors from 1.46 to
2.11, and from 1.58 to 2.83, respectively. Thus, this investigation reveals that not only
the degree of returns to scale is higher in the high-tech sector than in the low-tech
sector, but that the difference in the returns to scale between the two sectors has been
widening through time.
        Hence, this figure corroborates the results found by Romero (2015), which
suggested that the degree of returns to scale in manufacturing have increased from the
1970s and 1980s to the 1990s and 2000s, mainly due to an increase in the scale
economies observed in high-tech industries. Most importantly, the findings presented
in this chapter present a partial explanation for why returns to scale have increased in
the high-tech sector. Yet, the results indicate also that the autonomous (in relation to
research intensity) part of increasing returns (equation (6)) is still higher in high-tech
industries, reinforcing the findings of Romero (2015).

3.4. Robustness Assessment

Influential outliers

       In order to assess whether the results presented in the previous sections were
driven by influential outliers, SYS-GMM models were re-estimated excluding one
and two industries at a time, and also excluding one country at a time. All the
regressions generated results similar to the ones reported in column (vi) of Table 2.13

Four-year averages

         Kaldor-Verdoorn’s Law is normally estimated using 5-year averages to
remove short-term fluctuations and avoid that the estimates capture Okun’s Law. The
first three columns of Table 3 report estimates of equation (11) using 4-year
averages.14 Column (i) shows that using 4-year averages increases the magnitude of
the Verdoorn coefficient, while research intensity alone and its interaction with output
growth is no longer significant. Still, columns (ii) and (iii) indicate that for low-tech
industries, although the interaction between research intensity and output growth is
still not significant, research intensity is, the opposite applying to high-tech industries.
Hence, the results presented in the first three columns of Table 3 provide some
support to the results reported in Table 2. Yet, it seems that using 4-year averages
tends to increase the magnitude of the Verdoorn coefficient and reduce the effect of
research intensity on productivity growth.

Alterative measure

        Table 3 also presents estimates using the ratio of R&D expenditure to value
added as an alternative measure of research intensity. The R&D data used in these
tests was gathered from the OECD Analytical Business Enterprise Research and
Development (ANBERD) Database, for the period 1976-2006. Data from 1987 to
2006 is available classified according to ISIC Rev. 3, while from 1976 to 1986 data is
at ISIC Rev. 2. Nonetheless, at the level of aggregation used this does not represent a
problem, and it is straightforward to make the data compatible. The correspondence
between the two classifications becomes more complex only at higher levels of
disaggregation.
        R&D to output has been used in a number of studies to measure research
intensity, and although the results normally indicate that the variable has a positive
impact on productivity growth, the estimated coefficients vary considerably.
Zachariades (2004) found the research intensity has a positive and significant impact
on productivity growth, but the estimated effect varies from 0.47 to 1.69 using data
for the economy as whole, and from 0.24 to 0.32 using industry-level data. Griffith et
al. (2004) found similar results using industry-level data, with coefficients varying
from 0.34 to 0.86. In another study, Madsen (2008) examines a number of different
measures of research intensity, including patents per capita and R&D to GDP ratio.
For the latter measure, a positive and significant coefficient of 0.007 was found.
        The regression reported in column (iv) of Table 3 replicates the test of the
basic Schumpeterian models presented in Table 1. The result is similar to previous
studies, and indicates that research intensity has a positive and significant effect on
productivity growth. Column (v) shows that when output growth is introduced in the
regression research intensity is no longer significant. Multicolinearity between the
two variables does not seem to be a problem, since the correlation between them is
only 0.21. The interaction term, however, has a positive and significant impact on
productivity growth. The magnitude of the estimated coefficient is higher than found
in the tests that use patent per millions of hours worked as measure of research
intensity. However, this is because the level of the variables is different. In the
sample, the average number of patents per millions of hours worked is 0.333, while
the average R&D to value added ratio is 0.036. Consequently, using this average to
calculate the returns to scale following equation (6), given that δ = (1−1 / v) , the
implied degree of returns to scale found using R&D to value added ratio is indeed
very similar to the degree found using patents per millions of hours worked. Thus,
these tests provide additional support to the results reported in Table 2.

Different lags as instruments

        As Roodman (2009b) emphasised, SYS-GMM generates a large number of
instruments and this instrument proliferation weakens the capacity of the Hansen J
Test to detect violation of the ortoganality hypothesis. One form of solving this
problem, as Roodman (2009b) stressed, is to limit the lags used as instruments.
Nonetheless, it is often the case that using different lags as instruments leads to
marked changes in the estimated parameters, while Arellano and Bond’s AR test and
Hansen’s J test still indicate the validity of the instruments. In this case, it is difficult
to assess what is the preferred specification.

Column (vi) of Table 3 shows the results found using SYS-GMM but instrumenting
with lags that are different from those used in the tests reported in Table 2. The results
are similar to the benchmark regression reported in column (vi) of Table 2, although
the returns to scale found are higher then in the other regressions.

Alternative sample

        As mentioned in section 3.2, from 1995 onwards the basic data from EU
KLEMS is available for four additional countries: Czech Republic, Portugal,
Slovenia, and Sweden. In the tests reported thus far, a sample of 11 OECD countries
over the period 1976-2006 has been used.
        Column (vii) of Table 3 presents the results found adding Portugal, Slovenia
and Sweden to the sample, but considering only the period 1995-2006. Czech
Republic was excluded from the sample, given that additional tests revealed that this
country is an influential outlier. Still, this shows that further work is necessary to
assess whether the investigated relationship holds for more comprehensive samples of
countries. The results reported in column (vii) are similar to the results found in Table
2. Both output growth and the interaction term are significant and present magnitudes
similar to the previous tests.

Additional variables

         Table 3 also reports tests assessing the robustness of the results to the
inclusion of three additional variables that might explain productivity growth: (i)
human capital; (ii) government size; and (iii) quality of property rights.
         A number of works emphasise the importance of human capital for
productivity growth (e.g. Barro, 1991; Mankiw et al., 1992; Krueger and Lindahl,
2001; Barro and Lee, 2013). Furthermore, the importance of human capital is also
stressed in the Schumpeterian approach. Following the seminal approach of Nelson
and Phelps (1966), human capital is considered not only important to generate
innovations, but also to allow the absorption of foreign knowledge (e.g. Verspagen,
1991; Griffith et al., 2004). In the same spirit, R&D intensity is regarded relevant for
the absorption of foreign technology as well (e.g. Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Griffith
et al., 2004). There is evidence, however, that human capital is more important for
countries closer to the technological frontier (Vanderbussche et al., 2006).
         In addition, several studies analyse the impact of the size of government on
economic performance (e.g. Barro, 1991; Rajan and Zingales, 2003). The argument is
normally that large governments generate inefficiencies, so that the higher is the
government expenditure in proportion to GDP, the lower is the productivity growth.
         Finally, a number of works have been exploring the relationship between the
quality of institutions and productivity growth (e.g. La Porta et al., 1999; Acemoglu et
al., 2001; Djankov et al., 2002; Rodrik et al., 2004). This literature explores the
relationship between different institutions and productivity growth, such as property
rights, type of legal system, corruption and bureaucracy. The quality of property
rights, however, is the most important variable used in this literature. Furthermore,
apart from type of legal system, which is usually not significant, the other variables
are highly correlated, so that countries with good property rights normally feature low
corruption and low bureaucracy as well.
         The last three columns of Table 3, therefore, present the results of regressing
equation (11), whereby each of these variables is introduced one at a time. Research

intensity was dropped, since it has been found to be not significant in most tests. The
variables used in this analysis are the following. Human capital is the percentage of
population with tertiary education, from Barro and Lee (2013). Government size is
the share of government expenditure in GPD, from World Development Indicators.
Quality of property rights is measured by the Property Rights Index from the Heritage
Foundation, used by La Porta et al. (1999). Given that this variable is only available
from 1995 onwards, the alternative sample is used when testing the effect of this
variable.
        Columns (viii) to (x) of Table 3 show that the results reported in the previous
sections do not change significantly when human capital, government size and
property rights are introduced in the estimated equation. Interestingly, the only
variable that is significant is government size, which actually has a positive impact on
productivity growth. A possible explanation for this positive effect is that higher
public investment might foster innovation, which contributes to productivity growth.

4. Concluding remarks

        This paper investigated whether output growth and research intensity impact
on productivity growth, testing two alternative hypotheses. Firstly, the simultaneous
impact of the two variables on productivity growth was tested. This allowed assessing
if the basic Kaldorian and Schumpeterian models can be combined. Secondly, it was
examined whether research intensity impacts on the magnitude of returns to scale,
assessing if countries with higher research intensity benefit from higher returns to
scale.
        This inquiry revealed that higher research intensity generates higher
productivity growth (dynamic returns to scale) when associated with output growth.
This result is interpreted as an indication that higher research intensity generates
higher knowledge, which allows faster technical progress in response to output
growth. Research intensity alone, however, is rarely significant when the impact of
output growth on productivity growth is controlled for. Importantly, the results
reported in the paper are robust to: (i) the use of different econometric methods; (ii)
different samples; (iii) different measures of research intensity; (iv) different
instruments to control for endogeneity; and also (v) to the inclusion of additional
variables in the estimated equations.
        To sum up, the tests reported in this paper provide strong evidence of the
importance of demand growth for productivity growth and of the existence of
increasing returns to scale in manufacturing, while also recognizing the relevance of
research intensity for productivity growth. Most importantly, the test results suggest
that research intensity has a more relevant impact on the degree of returns to scale
than directly on productivity growth. Moreover, the tests indicate also that returns to
scale are higher in high-tech industries than in low-tech industries, notwithstanding
the fact that the impact of research intensity on the magnitude of scale economies is
similar in both groups of industries.
