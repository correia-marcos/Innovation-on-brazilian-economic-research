     Abstract—

     The theme of early marriage, in addition to being associated with developing countries, serves as an example of human
     rights violations. Although the discussion about the impacts that early marriage can generate in aspects such as education
     and health is extensive in other countries and the Brazilian legislation itself has some contradictions in the definition of child
     marriage, few are the works that elucidate the current situation of the child and adolescent female population in Brazil. This
     study is based on the comparison of data from 2002 to 2015 of the PNAD for girls and women from 12 to 49 years of age, in
     addition to using PNDS of 2006 as a basis for the probability of having a stable union (formal or informal) before the age of
     eighteen. The propensity Score Matching (PSM) method is used to analyze the influence that early marriage potentially has
     on woman’s educational background. These effects were negative in relation to completion of basic and higher education,
     by approximately 21% and 13%, respectively. The same PSM exercise was made for white and non-white women showing
     that early marriage’s impact on education reaches approximately 27% among white women and 15% among non-white
     women for Basic Education and a 15% impact for white and 12% for nonwhite women on higher education.

     A temática sobre casamento infantil, além de ser associada a países em desenvolvimento, serve como exemplo de violação
     dos direitos humanos. Embora a discussão acerca dos impactos que o casamento infantil possa gerar em aspectos como
     educação e saúde seja extensa em outros países e a própria legislação brasileira tenha algumas contradições na definição
     sobre casamento infantil, poucos são os trabalhos que elucidam a situação atual da população infantil e adolescente
     feminina no Brasil. Este estudo se baseia na comparação de dados de 2002 a 2015 da PNAD para meninas e mulheres de
     12 a 49 anos de idade, além de utilizar a PNDS de 2006 como fundamento para a probabilidade de ter uma união estável
     (casamento ou informal) antes dos dezoito anos. O método de Propensity Score Matching (PSM) é utilizado para analisar
     a influência que o casamento infantil potencialmente tem sobre a formação educacional das mulheres.Estes efeitos foram
     negativos em relação à conclusão do ensino básico e superior, em aproximadamente 21% e 13%, respectivamente. O

1     I NTRODUCTION
     Early marriage, known as a formal or an informal union entered into by an individual before reaching the
age of 181 , is a theme usually associated with developing countries and one of the main examples of human
rights violations. As this strong social norm is mainly related to female children and adolescents, indicators
show their relationship with the decrease in schooling rates[9], which will be the focus of this study, and
reproductive control [10], in addition to increased mortality and domestic violence situations [1]. Another
point of attention is the relation with the incidence of cases of early pregnancy and abandonment of children
[24], since the first often serves as a pretext for marriages that until then would have been denied by law, as
is the case of Brazil.
     Brazilian legislation defines as legal a minimum age of eighteen for marriage, but there are exceptions
in the Civil Code2 that allow the marriage to happen at the age of sixteen if there is parental or legal
representatives authorization. In cases of pregnancy including those related to sexual crimes, marriage can
also be allowed. This type of situation evidences a law that discriminates girls from boys, since only the former
can become pregnant. Upchurch et al. (2002) modeled the determinants of nonmarital fertility, focusing on
the effects of other life-course events such as education and marriage, showing that the risk of nonmarital
conception increases after leaving school, while the risk is lower for previously married women than for
never-married women, even controlling for age.
     Although the discussion about the impact that early marriage can generate in aspects such as education
and health is extensive in other developing countries and the Brazilian legislation itself presents reasons to be
contested, few studies clarify the current situation of the child and adolescent population in this regard. Some
studies indicate that Brazil is the first country in Latin America to have married or stable women until the age
of eighteen and the fourth largest in the world, with 35.6% of the female population married before the age
of 18 .
     Data from the 2010 Census also show fertility rates of 6.5% among women aged 15 to 19 years, with the
highest concentration in the North and Northeast regions, reaching 10% and 7%, respectively, while the other
regions present results close to 5.5 %. Among women aged 20-24, this pattern still persists, with rates of up
to 13% for the North and 10% for the Northeast, but from the age of 25 the fertility rates between the regions
are equalized, reaching a mean of 9%, maintaining a steady and similar drop over the next age brackets. The
Census for this year also indicates significant figures for marriage or marriage of girls compared to boys [28].
These results mainly illustrate the issue of the gender issue associated with early marriage. In addition to these
figures, some studies also denounce the lack of up-to-date data on the subject, making it difficult to conduct
a deeper analysis. The question "Age of the Person when contracting the First Union", for example, did not
compose the Demographic Census after 1991. On the other hand, the National Survey of Demography and
Health (PNDS), whose last edition occurred in 2006, offers rich information about the population as the age
of first menstruation, marriage, and use of contraceptive methods. The periodicity in which it is performed,
however, ends up contributing negatively to obtaining updated and comparable results over time. Thus, much
of the analysis on this topic ends up being limited to data provided by the IBGE and PNDS, as will be the
case of this study, or by independent organizations from private surveys.
     Considering the different impacts that early marriage may have on the lives of these girls, schooling
was chosen as an object of study based on available information on the Brazilian female population. Issues
posed by Taylor, Lauro, Segundo, Greene (2015) on early marriage and education involve school lag and

     This study is based on the comparison of data from 2002 to 2015 of the PNAD for girls aged 12 to 18
years and women over 18 years, in addition to using the 2006 PNDS to create a probability function for a girl
to enter into some type of union before the age of eighteen. This function will be applied in PNAD data and
the Propensity Score Matching method used to analyze the influence that early marriage potentially has on
the educational background of women. Therefore, the present work will be divided into four sections: in the
first one, the articles used as literature review. The methodology used will be presented in the second part,
followed by the results and conclusion in the next sections.


2      L ITERATURE R EVIEW
     To analyze the issue of early marriage in Brazil and its impact on educational, one point to be highlighted
is the disproportionate association that the theme "early marriage" has in relation to the female sex [21].
Denying the right to choose with whom or when to marry is a serious violation of human rights, since these
girls do not yet have the maturity or ability to make such choices [17]. In addition, engaging in this kind of
situation often results in negative psychological and emotional consequences, hampering their development
[20]. These notes denote that, above all, the problem of child and adolescent marriage is mainly a matter of
gender.
     To begin to think how this issue occurs in Brazil, Taylor, Lauro, Segundo, and Greene (2015) propose a
literature review from subtopics, to then analyze the productions on the subject in question. This is due to the
scarcity of specific publications on this topic in Brazil and the importance of understanding the variables that
eventually make up a study like this.
     Souzas and Alvarenga (2001) present relevant questions regarding the decision-making process of low-
income women in the city of São Paulo before starting an informal marriage or marriage. According to the
authors, such motives would be mainly related to a question of "excessive" family control over their choices
or search for better social and economic conditions. Marriage is then seen by the woman and her family
as a life-enhancing opportunity. Greene (1995), in turn, analyzes the marriage market through a case study
that discusses possible explanations for the increase of marriages and informal marriages in the state of
Bahia, Brazil. Informal relationships have proved to be a more comfortable alternative for men involved in
relationships with underage girls. In this way, a "recycling of relations" (sic) was observed. Another favorable
point for men in relation to informality is not having to provide assistance or pay pensions if there are children
involved. This type of study is relevant as it denounces the legal implications that often make informal unions
independent of age.
     If, in one hand, the number of publications on marriage in childhood and adolescence in Brazil has been
scarce, many are those who discuss related issues, such as pregnancy3 , mobility limitations, exposure to
different types of violence and, finally, educational delays and other challenges (Parsons et al., 2015; Loaiza
and Wong, 2012; Taylor et al., 2015). The latter, in turn, involves a number of issues that must be taken into
account when being used as an object of study from early marriage cases. Almeida et al. (2006) point out
dropouts and school deficits as the main issues faced by these girls.
     Also associated with early marriage, the sexual exploitation of minors is another factor cited in the
literature [26]. Although there are no studies focused on the effect of the Brazilian legislation on fertility,

47 ENCONTRO NACIONAL DE ECONOMIA – ANPEC                                                                                                       4

both pregnancy and sexual exploitation are sometimes tied to the gaps left by the Civil Code, such as the
possibility of marrying girls under the age of sixteen if pregnant, including cases of sexual abuse [28].
    Poverty is also a factor highly associated with early marriage. In an environment lacking financial
resources and low educational level, marriage is seen as an alternative to achieve a better economic situation,
being the "financial weight" of caring for a child transferred to the spouse [20]. In Brazil, economic and
social inequalities are evidenced by the concentration of income [6] and, therefore, end up aggravating the
issue of low educational achievement [24]. According to Almeida, Aquino and De Barros (2006), 40% of
the interviewed women who had children during adolescence gave up studying. Taylor, Lauro, Segundo and
Greene (2015) note in their research that the practice of marriage during childhood is not necessarily more
frequent among the population living in poverty than for girls who are not in this condition, but they recognize
that poverty in general is a factor in the life of girls before and during marriage and that their results may be
a particular case depending on the places and chosen research methods.
    The authors Taylor, Lauro, Segundo, and Greene (2015) also stress the weight of the expectation that a
pre-defined social role on women exerts in relation to the theme of marriage during childhood. The unequal
division of tasks within households, for example, which is institutionalized at an early age by the families,
causes the girls to take responsibility for the household much earlier than the boys [25].
    The report also addresses a constant in this type of marriage, which is the husbands’ age. Especially in
informal unions, adult males make up the relationship by claiming that younger girls are more attractive,
making them also feel younger. These men also report a lack of interest in performing religious ceremonies
because, according to them, it would mean a big commitment. One issue addressed in some studies is the
endogenous relation between pregnancy, education, and early marriage. Lloyd and Mensch (2008) point out
the strong correlation between these three and the challenges in terms of estimation, since school presence
is endogenous in relation to the moment of marriage, for example. Thus, it is explicit that either child or
adolescent marriage, or pregnancy before adulthood may result from common factors. These factors, called
by the author of "underlying cases", include socioeconomic issues, regulations, cost of marrying, parent’s
educational level, among others [25].
    With this question in hand, the literature suggests that the possible relationship between educational
frequency, age at first marriage, age at conception of the first child, and workforce are healed with the use
of instrumental variables (Machio et al., 2017; Marchetta and Sahn, 2012; Herrera and Sahn, 2013; Glick
et al., 2015). Schultz (1997) points out that early marriage and first gestation are two factors that affect school
attendance, while higher rates of school attendance may delay pregnancy during childhood and adolescence.
Thus, a variable used would be the level of knowledge that a person has about the law on child marriage, since
most unions are not officialized. Tam (2017) uses this variable to estimate the long-term effect, concluding
that those who had greater contact with the law4 , had lower odds of subjecting underage girls to marriage.
    Building the analysis of this issue from a social perspective in which girls marry for reasons ranging from
unstable family environment to life-changing expectations, many see education as unattractive or out of reach
[9]. Therefore, once married, there is a deterioration in the prospects of education and work [11]. In this case,
even if they decide to abandon their marriages, this dilemma becomes more latent to them than to girls of the
same age, but who are not married [28]. Moreover, among those who remain married 5 , the partner often ends

girls and 21 for boys
   5. In this work we will assign the term "married" to girls who declare themselves to be spouses and therefore may be in unions of different
kinds.

up assigning household and household functions raising their children to their spouse, further discouraging
their quest for educational and professional training [1].
    Continuing the search for contributions at the international level, Asadullah (2016) use the low educational
levels and recurrent cases of early marriage in poor neighborhoods of Bangladesh in 2012 as a motivation to
study the causal effect of early marriage in the educational background of these adolescents. Using information
about the time of first menstruation, they try to predict the age of the first marriage, since in patriarchal
societies women experience greater pressure to marry right after the first menstruation (Field and Ambrus,
2008; Asadullah, 2016).
    Thus, the authors show that those who are mothers and married before the age of eighteen have
significantly lower schooling rates than those who married latter. In addition, their results indicate that
children of mothers who marry too early also have lower educational outcomes. Explanations involve parental
decisions, especially of mothers, who pressure their daughters to marry early. These mothers also end up
investing less in their training, and this same control had no effect on boys. Asadullah (2016) also show that
mothers who marry early appear to be less empowered within marriage and therefore have less influence on
the educational background of their children.
    This study aims to provide results on a topic that has not been explored in Brazil, empirically verifying
whether the cases of child and adolescent marriage in Brazil impact in some way the educational development
of girls and women. Use several years and different data sources will serve as a way to enrich the analysis by
tracing a profile of Brazilian girls and adolescents and measure their relationship with educational outcomes
applying econometric methods such as the Propensity Score Matching (PSM).

3     M ETHODOLOGY
    To measure the possible association and impact between early marriage cases and educational outcomes
of Brazilian girls and women, two sources will be used. The first will be the PNDS (National Survey of
Demography and Health) for the year of 2006, and the second will be the PNAD (National Household
Sample Survey) from 2002 to 2015. The first will be applied to girls and women who married before the
age of eighteen, allowing to estimate the likelihood of joining a marital union before the age of eighteen
that later will be applied to the PNAD data. Considering that the PNDS is the only source in Brazil that
presents a question about the girls or woman’s age at the time of the first union, it will be possible to calculate
such probability using different controls such as geographic region, housing whether or not belonging to the
urban area, income, among others. With this probability function that will be estimated from the coefficients
generated by the probit of the first stage, it will be possible to use the same controls found in the PNAD
to create a proxy variable for union before the age of eighteen and then obtain results using the method of
Propensity Score Matching and its impact on education. PNAD data will be used considering the periodicity
of this research being greater than the PNDS, being the first annual, compared to the decennial period of the
second.

3.1   Sample and Data
3.1.1 National Demography and Health Survey (PNDS)
    The PNDS of 2006 is the last edition available from the Ministry of Health, and although it does not
present recent data, it has relevant elements to outline the profile of Brazilian girls analyzed here. These
elements include information about the occurrence of first menstruation, performing abortions, receiving
fellowships and governmental aid, use of contraceptive methods and, especially, the age at which she began
47 ENCONTRO NACIONAL DE ECONOMIA – ANPEC                                                                                                      6

to live in some kind of union. This last issue is not addressed by the PNAD and will be essential for the
analysis as a whole, since it will allow the creation of a probability function that will later be used in PNAD
data as proxy variable for early marriage. In addition to more specific variables such as those mentioned
above, the PNDS also covers issues addressed by PNAD, such as age, sex, demographic region, among
others. Finding variables that are associated with the question that will be analyzed here and which are also
present in both databases is one of the primary factors of this analysis, since the use of the same variables will
allow to obtain the coefficients that ’connects’ both data bases. These common variables will be discussed
later.
3.1.2 National Household Sample Survey (PNAD)
    In addition to the PNDS, the PNAD, carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE), presents annual information6 on population in demographic and socioeconomic terms. Therefore, it
was decided to use the available annual data from 2002 to 2015, allowing to try to extend the size of the
results obtained from the probability model that will be generated using the PNDS data.
    In spite of being an extensive database and widely used by the academy, in this case the PNAD does not
offer variables as specific as those offered by PNDS. Another point of attention is the methodological capacity
applied by IBGE in terms of sampling. In this case, it is necessary to consider the possibility that the PNAD
does not fully capture in its sample methodological nuances of the Brazilian reality, which are generally not
easily recorded, such as data captured in marginalized areas, for example7 .
    However, there are other features that support the use of this database, such as the frequency with which
it occurs, its length and the number of observations. The existence of variables in common with the PNDS
will also allow to extract information from the estimates that will be explained later.

3.2 Variables
3.2.1 Dependent Variable
    Having in mind that this study aims to analyze the possible impact that early marriage has on educational
outcomes, four variables of interest will be used in two different moments of this research. The first part
involves a variable of interest using the PNDS database "Age when starting to live with the first partner" for
Brazilian girls and women from 10 to 49 years old (Table 1). This variable and the probabilistic model created
from it will be discussed later in the section 3.3.1. The second part involves two variables of interest based
on the PNAD data: Whether or not basic education was concluded and whether or not higher education was
completed8 .
    Therefore:                         (
                                         1, completed basic education or more
                                y1i =                                                                      (1)
                                         0, or else
                                          (
                                            1, completed higher education.
                                    y2i =                                                                  (2)
                                            0, or else
    Being i = female subjects between 25 and 60 years of age.
   6. By the year 2015 the IBGE conducted annual surveys, having its frequency changed to quarterly results from 2016.
   7. Further versions of this study will aim to introduce Census data in order to provide wider information and other comparison possibilities.
The latest data is from 2010, being the next one expected to be available in 2021/2022.
   8. Tests were carried out using completion of primary, secondary and higher education as variable responses, but not significantly different
results were obtained between the first two, leading to the replacement of the first two with one that encompasses those who have completed
elementary education.
47 ENCONTRO NACIONAL DE ECONOMIA – ANPEC                                                                                  7

3.2.2 Control Variables
    The literature on early marriage, both international and national, is practically unanimous in pointing
out which variables to consider for this type of analysis (Ainsworth et al., 1996; Asadullah, 2016; Parsons
et al., 2015). These variables include (Brazilian) region of residence, whether urban or not, religion (catholic,
evangelical or other), number of children born alive up to the date of the interview and age of the children,
besides educational information about parents and spouses, age of the spouse, if she has a living mother, if
she has already received or receives "Bolsa Familia9 ", and finally the monthly per capita household income.
    For this study, it was necessary to determine variables that possibly were associated with the issue of
early marriage and which were also available in both databases. It is important that the variables be the same
so that, after estimating the probability function of a girl to marry before the age of eighteen with the PNDS
data, the coefficients of the variables used are used to create the new variable using the PNAD.
    In the next step, to estimate the probability function and later the Propensity Score Matching, we will use
variables such as: domicile located in urban or rural area, Brazilian region, labor income10 , receiving school
scholarships and "Bolsa Familia", if she ever had a child born alive and ethnicity (Table 1). The estimation of
the latent variable that expresses the probability of a girl starting an union before the age of 18 in this case
is nothing more than the application of the coefficients obtained in the first stage of the probit of the PNDS
to the annual data of the PNAD using a normalized probability function. Using the same variables in this
case not only ceases to be a problem, as corroborates for a more robust analysis, since they are two databases
with completely different individuals, but that are analyzed from the same characteristics. Thus, the PSM will
indicate what impact each of the characteristics (variables) considered exerts on education, having the woman
or girl in question married or not before the age of eighteen.

3.3   Econometric Model
3.3.1 Estimating the latent variable that expresses the probability for union before age eighteen.
    Again, one point of attention associated with this type of study lies in the endogeneity between the
decision to marry during childhood or adolescence and to give up studies - or to leave them in the background
[22]. Thus, it would be necessary to define instrumental variables that explain the decision to marry and, at
the same time, do not explain the results on education conditioned to the decision to marry.
    An alternative, therefore, would be to use the relevant information that exists in a not-so-updated database
(PNDS) to connect to another database which, in addition to being more recent, has a longer period available
for analysis so that the time effect is measured; to PNAD. Thus, the issue of endogeneity would be remedied,
since different individuals will be compared, but with similar characteristics.
    To use this information and create a new early marriage variable, called here "Marriage during
Childhood11 , from the variable "Age when you start living with the first companion" of the PNDS. Thus,
using variables that are present in both the PNDS and the PNAD, the coefficients generated through the
PNDS can be used to create the variable "Marriage in Childhood" using the PNAD. Therefore, the first step
will be to obtain the coefficients by means of a probit using the PNDS, where:

3.3.2    Defining treatment and control groups
    It is worth bearing in mind that the variable created from the latent variable applied to the PNAD,
"Marriage in Childhood", represents the probability of a woman having started some kind of union before
the age of eighteen, the treatment and control groups will be defined, therefore, based on those who married
during adolescence and those who did not marry, respectively.
    Thus, from the distributions shown in figures 2 and 3, these groups will be divided and analyzed under
the 85% percentile12 of the calculated probability distribution with respect to PNAD data, of which:

                                                   P (Yi = 1) = P r(yi∗ ≥ 0.85)                                          (9)


                                                   P (Yi = 0) = P r(yi∗ < 0.85)                                         (10)

variable that will act as control and treatment, the Propensity Score Matching (Delprato et al., 2015; Koski,
2016; King et al., 2007) will be used to test the two groups from the probabilities estimated by the previous
function. This way it will be possible to try to find pairs of participants in the treatment and control groups
who are comparable. Propensity Score Matching can therefore be defined as:

    Being X a vector composed of variables that provoke imbalance between treatment and control groups,
being girls and women between 12 and 49 years of age married and not married during adolescence,
respectively. These variables that belong to vector X will be those that affect only the selection bias discussed
in section 3.2.2.
    Also, being X a vector containing variables that will allow to determine the probability of being treated
from the function P(X), score of propensity, previously estimated by the probit model. Yet T = 1 represents
whether she was 85% or more likely to have married during adolescence. In addition, it was assumed that the
decision to marry does not depend on factors related to X. Thus:

                                                E[yi |X, T = 1] = E[yi |X, T = 0]                                                     (12)

    After estimating the models, balancing tests, sensitivity analysis and impact calculations will be
performed. There are different types of pairing, being the choice of which method to use related to the
set of factors that compose X [4]. One limitation regarding this method lies in the fact that individuals contain
not only a vector of observable characteristics, but also many other unobserved features. If these are correlated
with the decision to marry and with the potential outcome, the method may contain selection bias.


4     R ESULTS        AND     D ISCUSSION
4.1    Descriptive Analysis and Expected Results
    Based on the literature presented and the methodology to be used, it is expected that women who started
some kind of union before the age of eighteen - or, in the case to be estimated, have characteristics that imply
a high probability of having married in childhood or adolescence - present lower rates of completion of the
analyzed educational cycles. In order to understand the results obtained and the possible aspects associated
with them, the data available will be analyzed from different perspectives. Table 1 presents summary statistics
of girls and women according to three age groups (10 to 14 years, 15 to 17 and 18 or more) for the beginning
of the first union, according to the PNDS, while the Table 3 presents demographic information from PNAD
from 2002 to 2015.
    Starting the analysis of the place of residence, it can be seen that women who married before the age
of 15 live in urban areas in a lower proportion compared to the other groups (65% against 71% and 78%,
respectively)13 . This data points to other studies output that women living in rural areas are twice as likely to
marry earlier during adolescence [8].
    From the racial point of view14 , a similar relationship exists between the participation of white girls and
women according to age, with 27% of them entering the first union between 10 and 14 years of age and 43%
among those who entered union after eighteen years of age. Comparing this result with the values presented
for other black and brown women and girls, it is possible to notice a different result pattern, with the average
number of girls starting the first union before 15 years older than the following age groups.

  13. According to the PNDS, in 2006 urban areas were occupied by approximately 65% e 66% of all respondents, men and women, who were
10 to 14 and 15 to 17 years old at the time of the interview, respectively. Among those who were 18 years of age or older, they represent an
average of 72% of urban dwellers.
  14. Values presented for self-reported white, black and brown women, only.
47 ENCONTRO NACIONAL DE ECONOMIA – ANPEC                                                                                  11

    In addition, observing the results for those who declared themselves to be black or brown, there is a
movement contrary to that presented by whites, corroborating the idea that the theme of early marriage may
be essentially related to a racial issue [28]. Bearing in mind that the context that leads to child marriage in
Brazil is commonly associated with situations of poverty inherently related to race [21], it is expected to
observe a negative racial effect on education among those who have declared themselves to be non-white
and marry during adolescence. This factor will serve as a justification for assessing whether there are also
significant impacts of child marriage on schooling from a racial perspective.
    Again, both the age at first intercourse and the age at first pregnancy increase according to the age range,
both of which are around the age of fourteen for girls whose first union occurred before 15 years15 . One
point of attention is the 9.32 standard deviation presented on the age of the 1st relation, evidencing a possible
relation with the problematic about cases of child sexual exploitation [26].
    Differently from the previous variables, the average age of the spouse did not present great differences
between the age ranges, remaining around 38 years. Using as a basis for interpretation that the women who
answered the questionnaire remained with the same man with whom they entered the first union, one could
assume a difference of age of 5 to 8 years between the spouses according to the age range decay.
    In terms of geographic distribution, it was observed that unions before the age of 15 occur mainly in the
north and northeast, similar information presented by Taylor et al. (2015), in which only between the years
2003 and 2011 there were a generalized drop in marriage numbers in Brazil, but the same movement did not
occur for the states of the North and Northeast. Among those who started the first union between 15 and 17
years, one can notice a greater prevalence in the South and Midwest regions, while those that belong to the
third age range belong mostly to the Southeast and South regions.
    Considering that more than 80% of the sample was working when the survey was conducted in spite of the
age range the girl got into her first union, once again it is possible to notice the increasing income discrepancy
between women. These values almost triplicate between those that joined a union before the others, starting
from R$ 286.70 and reaching R$ 674.20. Observing the household income corresponding to each range, it is
also possible to note that women who started union before age 15 belonged, on average, to families with lower
incomes, reaching less than 2 minimum wages16 , while those families whose women belong to the other two
age groups receive on average a little less than three minimum wages (R$ 859.60) and four minimum wages
(R$ 1,383.8).
    Still according to PNDS data and following the same division for age range of the first union, Table 4
presents the summary measures for variables related to schooling, thus allowing us to trace the profile of
these women and then to assume possible expected results for the Propensity Score Matching which will be
estimated below. Observing the results, it is possible to note the possible effects associated with the early
union in the educational formation of Brazilian girls and women.
    Those who started unions before age 15 were, on average, the majority of those who did not have any
type of schooling (despite being a low number), 1.5% compared to 0.76% among those who started union
between 15 and 17 years of age and 0.25% among women whose union occurred after seventeen years of
age. The same pattern in a similar proportion occurs between those who attended only Elementary School or
Technical Course, while none of the women in the sample who belong to the age group at the time of the first
union have a postgraduate degree, being also a minority in the Higher Education courses.
    Looking now at the annual results presented by Table 5 for PNAD, it is possible to see a slight decrease

in the average number of married adolescents before the age of eighteen over the years17 . This number, which
in 2002 represented approximately 10% of the sample, was reduced to 7% by 2015. A similar drop could be
observed among married women aged 18 or 19 years, but the same does not occur among respondents above
age of 19 years. For the latter group, there have been no significant changes over the years, indicating that
women continue to initiate marriages, despite the increase in numbers related to divorce and female heads of
household, surpassing 40% in 2015 [5].

4.2    Regression Results
    Before evaluating the effects of early marriage on each educational cycle obtained when executing the
PSM (Section 3.3.3), it is necessary to observe the impacts that each variable mentioned above generates on
the propensity of a girl or woman who have observable characteristics similar to the ones that married before
or after the age of eighteen.
    Table 6 contains the probit coefficients generated in Section 3 as the basis for the Propensity score
Matching of each educational cycle. Each cycle, therefore, was used as a dependent variable based on the
treatment dummy created as a proxy for early marriage.
    Regarding basic education, the results indicate that there was no racial significance for white girls in
relation to marriage before the age of eighteen, while for higher education, this relationship was positive.
This result goes against the intuition initially expected that white girls are less likely to marry before the age
of eighteen and not the other way around, as observed in Table 1. No information or similar results have
been identified in the literature to explain this relationship, leading us to believe that a justification could be
associated with income, a variable that was not included at this stage, although in this case having better
financial conditions does not serve as a guarantee that child marriage can not occur in this context [28].
    Still on the results presented in Table 6, it is possible to see that for both types of education, girls living in
urban areas are less likely to join an union before the age of eighteen. This is because, in addition to having
greater access to school and transportation, there is a better chance of occurrence of enrollment, attendance,
and knowledge about the Statute of the Child and Adolescent [25]. In addition, informal relationships may
end up happening to a greater extent in rural areas because they are considered part of a "cultural tradition"
[28]. Like those living in the South and Southeast regions, the opposite occurs, however, for those residing in
the northeast region, meaning a greater propensity to marry before reaching the age of majority.
    Observing the other results related to white and nonwhite women (Table 7), it is possible to see that all
those residing in urban areas are less likely to enter into marriage before reaching the age of majority. Again,
the explanation for this phenomenon remains independent of ethnicity. Among the regions analyzed, there
was consensus among the results for all regions, meaning that regardless of schooling, those residing in the
Northeast region are more likely to join in before the age of eighteen. This same pattern could be observed
for the South and Southeast regions, but now indicating a lower propensity on the part of the girls and women
of this sample.
    When it comes to the effects of early marriage on each educational cycle obtained when executing the
PSM, the initial results were negative for the difference between the values generated for treatment (married
during adolescence) and control (other women who married after the age of eighteen) in both educational
levels (Table 8). This result shows that those who started a union before the age of eighteen presented a lower
chance of finishing a given educational period when compared to their peers with similar characteristics, but
who, in the second case, started their first union after the eighteen years.

  17. A statistically significant mean difference was observed for marriage data between the analyzed years.
47 ENCONTRO NACIONAL DE ECONOMIA – ANPEC                                                                                                        13

                                                                 < Table 8 >
    The effect of marriage before the age of eighteen on the completion of basic education mainly shows how
early marriage serves as a disincentive to study, and each additional year of basic education may be associated
with lower risks of marriage during adolescence and pregnancy [30]. In addition, this disincentive factor is
linked to the fact that for a marriage to occur before the age of eighteen, it would be necessary that the
responsible ones allowed the emancipation of the daughter18 . Thus, once emancipation is granted based on
the marriage relationship, the compulsory school enrollment and attendance imposed by the Brazilian Statute
of the Child and Adolescent, would be no longer applied. This breach in the system may open precedents so
that girls in union during adolescence may fail to study.
    Wodon (2018) also supports the idea that, although the social norm associated with child marriage is
explicit and involves largely family members seeking some kind of protection for their daughter, access to
quality educational settings would be the best way to combat early marriage, regardless of country.
    In the higher education scenario, the difference was lower, 13% against the 21% related to basic education.
This would be because, in theory, those who reach higher levels of education, continued their studies because
of different other incentives, which could be from a characteristic related to their own - or even the husband’s
- income, since the married teenager in a context with more financial resources would not have to take on a
larger share of tasks and could rely on the help of third parties to ensure the rearing of any children while
studying [23].
    Now targeting outcomes among white and non-white women, we again found negative results regarding
differences between treatment and control groups (Table 9).
                                                                 < Table 9 >
    Among those who finished primary education, white women who joined a marital union before the age
of eighteen are less likely to complete this educational cycle when compared to those who came into union
after reaching the age of majority (Table 6). Viewed from the perspective of the universe of nonwhite women,
there is also a lower propensity to complete the educational cycle when the union happens before the age of
eighteen, but to a lesser extent when compared to white women. A possible explanation could be associated
with the idea that, when compared to the others, the proportion of non-white women between 18 and 24 years
of age who had not finished high school and were not attending school by themselves is already higher than
of white women19 .
    Upchurch et al. (2002) show in their study that in cases of women who first married, interrupted their
studies and had no children, 2.9% were black compared to 6.8% of white and Hispanic women evaluated20 ,
justifying that one of the reasons may be associated with the fact that black women tend to either drop out of
school or have children and then carry out the remaining steps.
    In addition, when the proportion of people by level of education is assessed among white and non-white
women, it is necessary to consider factors that lead to proportions that initially appeared similar between both
races for results on complete Elementary and Incomplete Secondary Education (14.3% and 14.5% for white

   18. According to the Civil Code 2002, in the 5th term, single paragraph , II, the law does not require a minimum age for emancipation through
marriage. Still in the Civil Code 2002, article 1,520, the marriage of minors of 16 years can occur, exceptionally, without case of pregnancy.
   19. This proportion reaches 25% for white women compared to 37% for black women and births (IBGE, Demographic Census 2010).
   20. It is necessary to emphasize that in this study the authors did not apply the same methodology used in the present study and neither have
the same objective, since they focus on examining the determinants that lead to the fertility of North American women outside marriage and their
effects on events such as education - taking into account the issue of endogeneity. See table 2, p. 317, of their study for more information on the
different scenarios analyzed.

and non-white, respectively), but differing in the following educational levels, reaching a proportion of 17.7%

5   C ONCLUSION         AND   F URTHER W ORK
     This study aims to contribute under different aspects to the issue of early marriage in Brazil. In the
foreground is the lack of up-to-date data and a deep analysis of its true situation in Brazil. This subject has
been explored more assiduously in recent years as a result of initiatives to combat this and other gender issues
that have structural sexism as its common denominator.
     Thus, this study contributes to the measure that offers a new strategy to deal with the lack of data faced by
those who study the problem of early marriage in Brazil. The variable created as a proxy for early marriage,
which was generated from a probability function based on the coefficients obtained by the PNDS, could then
be transformed into a new treatment variable. This process in itself would already allow the analysis of the
impacts of early marriage under different aspects beyond the educational issue discussed here.
     In addition to the contribution in terms of strategy for data analysis, this paper also offers results on the
impacts of early marriage on the educational background of Brazilian girls and women over the last years.
In addition to the descriptive analysis presented, the Matching performed between the variable generated for
treatment and control allowed to obtain the effects of early marriage on education. These effects, therefore,
were negative in relation to completion of basic and higher education, by approximately 21% and 13%,
respectively. This information is supported by the preliminary results presented both in Table 8, and in Figure
4 where it is possible to observe the inverse relationship between the highest attended series versus the age of
the first union based on PNDS data.
     After repeating the PSM exercise by segmenting the sample among white and non-white women, the
difference in the impact of early marriage on education reaches approximately 27% among white women
and 15% among non-white women for completion of Basic Education 15% for white and 12% for nonwhite
impact on higher education. Thus, women who have observable characteristics similar to the ones that married
before the age of eighteen tend to conclude less frequently both types of education compared to those who
marry after reaching adulthood regardless of their color.
     Bearing in mind that access to education and encouragement of parents to it serve as primary factors for
the decrease in the occurrence of early marriage in Brazil [25] and that pregnancy during adolescence also
serves as a point of attention linked to both cases of early marriage studies such as this become relevant as
they provide an estimate of this issue based on data from recent years.
     Thus, it is suggested that for future studies the technique used here is improved so that the probability
function becomes increasingly capable of capturing the nuances that characterize the profile of those who
initiate a union before reaching the age of majority. It is also expected that new data will be made available
and some already existing variables, reviewed, so that they can be better utilized in the analysis.
