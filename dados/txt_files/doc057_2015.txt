          Brazil is a pioneer in biofuels policies. Due to previous concerns (diversification
      of energy matrix and rural development) and new concerns (environmental issues) it
      is important to know the marginal effects of the demand for ethanol and gasoline in
      order to prescribe appropriate public policies. In addition to the core marginal ef-
      fects (price and income) of a regular demand estimations, cross prices marginal effects
      have special appealing in the Brazilian fuel market because of substitution possibility
      between ethanol and gasoline after 2003 with the novel of flex fuel cars. Regarding
      estimation strategies, we performed non-neighbors purchase prices as instruments for
      ethanol and gasoline prices to solve endogeneity issues. Results showed ethanol´s
      price elasticities around -1.5 and gasoline´s elasticities around -0.8. Regarding flex
      fuel cars influence on elasticities, results indicate price and cross prices with higher
      elasticities for both demands after the introduction of flex fuel cars.

          Brasil é um pioneiro em políticas ambientais. Devido a antigas preocupações
      (diversificação da matriz energética e desenvolvimento rural) e novas preocupações
      (preocupações ambientais) é importante saber os efeitos marginais da demanda de
      etanol e da de gasolina com intuito de direcionar adequadamente as políticas públi-
      cas. Adcionalmente aos principais efeitos marginais de qualquer demanda (renda e
      preço), preços dos substitutos têm um especial apelo no mercado brasileiro por conta
      da substitutibilidade entre gasolina e etanol pós-2003. Sobre as estratégias de esti-
      mação, usamos preços de compra dos não-vizinhos como instrumento para os preços
      da gasolina e do etanol, controlando problemas de endogeneidade. Os resultados in-
      dicam que o etanol tem elasticidade preço de -1,5 e a gasolina elasticidade de -0,8.
      A influência dos carros flex (pós-2003) é percebida com aumentos das elasticidades
      preço e preço cruzada para ambos os combustíveis.

1       Introduction
Biofuels is a convergent point of some major challenges for the world. They have implica-
tions for climate change, energy security and food competition. In Brazil biofuels policies
began in 1970s for two main reasons: i) to reduce oil dependence; ii) rural development.
At that time, there was a perfect scenario to welcome biofuels policies. There were oil
crisis (oil prices were multiplied by 5 between Oct/1973 and March/1974) deteriorating
balance trade of importers. In addition to this, there were also lower sugar prices putting
down revenue of sugar cane farmers in Brazil. Hence, decision to produce ethanol from
sugar cane reached many goals, reducing oil dependence, improving trade balance and
subsidizing local farmers. During the oil prices in the 1980s, oil prices fall and directed
the interest on biofuels in Brazil and also in other countries1 .
    During 2000s the interest on biofuels policies rose again. At this time, there were even
more reasons for that, mainly environmental concerns and oil prices´ volatility. Mainly
after 2008, due to food crisis with the increasing of the most agricultural commodities
prices and price volatility the discussion about competition between biofuels and food
returned, making the two major economies (Europe and US) to rethink biofuels policies
(OECD, 2013)2 .
    Whatever is the motivation (environmental concerns, increase energy security, improve
balance trade or subsidize local farms), it is important to know price elasticities of fuels.
For example, considering Brazilian market, if a policy aims the reduction on gasoline con-
sumption through increasing prices, it is important to answer some questions first: i) if
prices are able to change consumption, what extent of change is needed? ii) which price
should be increased (decreased) by taxes mechanism? For ethanol or gasoline Brazilian
demand it is important to consider both prices (ethanol prices and gasoline prices) as
demand determinants, which increase the set of choices for some policies and make Brazil
a nice mirror for potential biofuels policies for other countries.
    Once to know elasticities are important to propose public policies, how to estimates
those properly is the next natural step. In this sense is important try to care about endo-
geneity problems caused by simultaneity among supply and demand. Without considering
endogeneity problems, there is a downward bias (Davis and Kilian, 2011), estimation are
toward to zero because of correlation between increases in demand and increases in prices,
generating correlation between price and error term (price is endogenous).
    Some methods has been used in literature to address this problem, the most common
is Instrumental Variables (IV) approach. Most used instruments for gasoline prices are
oil prices (time series level) and price of other refinery goods as kerosene and diesel prices
(panel data level)3 . In our study we used an approach close in spirit with Liu (2014)
    1
     Some countries had similar public policies regarding to reduce oil dependence after oil shocks of 1970s,
including Argentina, Costa Rica, Malawi, Sweden and Zimbabw. For more details see Johnson and Silveira
(2014).
   2
     The effects of biofuels on deforestation and global hunger, lack of supply capacity and the monetary
cost of those policies are in debate. In these major markets, biofuels do not have a good energy balance.
Ethanol from sugar cane has an energy balance (total of fossil fuel energy needed to produce) six times
better than corn one. The same happens with CO2 reduction compared to gasoline; ethanol from sugar
cane can reduce CO2 emissions in 84%, while corn can reduce emissions in 30%. For more details see
Goldemberg and Guardabassi (2010).

     In a panel data with time effects the oil prices (instrument for gasoline demand) or sugar prices
(instrument for ethanol) would be redundant with time effects, once they do not have variation intra
panel, the international price of oil is the same for all states of some country.

constructing instruments with purchase prices of ethanol, gasoline and diesel excluding
the prices of neighbors.
    The goal of this paper is to investigate the gasoline and ethanol elasticites, focused
on the changes led by the introduction of flex fuel cars in Brazil in 2003, on the marginal
effects of ethanol and gasoline demands. In particular, the introduction of these cars in-
creased the opportunity for consumers to arbitrage between these two fuels´ prices and,
therefore, we expect to find evidence of greater demand substitution between these fuels.
We hypothesize that the own and cross price elasticities of both ethanol and gasoline in
Brazil increased in their magnitudes after flex cars and that these elasticities are higher
than the world average, mainly because of the cited policy. We investigate these hypothe-
ses using monthly data from 2001m7 to 2014m12. The inherent endogeneity problem is
addressed with an Instrumental Variables (IV) approach in which we construct instru-
ments with temporally and spatially lagged purchase prices of ethanol, gasoline and diesel
from neighboring states and excluding the prices of nearest neighbors.
    The paper makes several important contributions. By focusing on changes in price
elasticities over time, we are able to consider the effect of an important change in the
Brazilian market, the introduction of flex fuel cars. In addition, we improve the estima-
tion of price elasticities using appropriate IVs to control for the simultaneity between prices
and quantity that otherwise biases estimates towards zero. In comparing the IV results
to OLS estimates and to previous estimates that did not control for this endogeneity, we
find estimates that reveal larger price elasticities, that is, our own price ethanol demand
elasticities are around -1.5 for and roughly 0.5 for the cross price elasticity. Likewise,
gasoline demand elasticities are around -0.8 for the own price elasticity, 0.1 for the cross
price elasticity. Both demands showed an income elasticity of around 0.8. Our findings
indicate that the introduction of flex fuel cars changed the demand for light fuels in ways
that have important implications for welfare and policy. When we used interacted time
dummies to verify changes into demand shifts, the major shift change was found from
period 1 (2001m1 – 2005m6) to period 2 (2006m1 – 2010m6), while the parameters from
period 2 to period 3 (2010m7 – 2014m12) had just small changes. The changes were in the
expected direction, with increasing in substition. This increased substitution has positive
implications for consumer welfare, given that consumers are now less susceptible to a price
increase in any market. On the other hand, it has the potential to make both markets
more volatile.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we review the previous literature
on the demand for light fuels in Brazil and provide some highlights of the Brazilian light
fuels market. We then describe the challenges of properly estimating ethanol and gasoline
demands, with special attention for the endogeneity and instruments issues. Finally the
paper concludes with a discussion of the results, and in the last section we present the
final remarks.


2     Background
2.1   Literature Review
Many studies worldwide with respect to demand for light fuels show gasoline as an inelas-
tic good in the short and long run. Usually, long run elasticity tend to be larger because
of a larger range of adjustment possibilities. These facts are in line with traditional mi-


                                              3
croeconomics theory, once fuels have just a few alternatives in the short run, but these
possibilities increase in the long run. For example, if gasoline price had an unexpected
and permanent increase, the consumption of the next days probably would not change
in a significant way, but with more time, consumers start to rethink their transportation
strategies, generating larger changes in the demand.
    Also from traditional microeconomics, demand for light fuels are modelled invariably
using at least price and income as explanatory variables. Some studies, such as Burn-
quist and Bacchi (2002) and Cheung and Thomson (2004), do not use other controls and
estimates demand using just these two variables. Two important surveys about gasoline
demand are Dahl and Sterner (1991) and Espey (1998), and they showed a large range
of econometric techniques used to estimate demand for light fuels, such as: time series,
panel data, cross sections, instrumental variables and others. According to these surveys,
estimated price elasticities were between (−0.12; −0.44) in the short run and (-0.23;-1.05)
in the long run, and income elasticities (0.14; 0.58) in the short run and (0.68; 1.31) in the
long run. For a better view of other papers results we did a summary with the World
average (surveys), one result for the US Market, one for Europe and the last results for
the Brazilian Market.
    It is possible to see in Table-1 that Brazilian Market usually shows larger elasticity
than US and Europe. This fact is due to income levels and preferences, and now we
also add flex fuel cars explanation for this elasticities differences. Santos (2013) (2012)
estimated elasticites (price, cross-price and income) using a DOLS estimator for the long
run and a GMM´s Arellano Bond. The effect of flex fuel on elasticities was small and/or
insignificant (sample goes from Jul/2001 to Dec/2011 on quarterly basis). Freitas and
Kaneko (2011) focused on effects of flex fuel cars on ethanol demand in Brazil, but carried
out to estimate and explain the gasoline influence on ethanol demand, without taking inot
account ex-ante and ex-post changes due to flex fuel cars.

    So far we are talking about previous results in the literature about fuel demand, but
what is the motivation to study fuel demand and why in Brazil? The answers will undergo
key words such as energy security, long run oil shortage, alternative fuels and environmen-
tal concerns.
    It is well-known that oil is a finite resource, therefore, moving in a direction to be less
dependent of it is a fundamental necessity, but the question is about the right timing to
do that. The world proved reserves4 of oil passed from 1041.4 thousand million barrels
    4
      Proved reserves can be calculated in different ways, but the most common is to use those quantities of
oil that can be extracted with actual economic and engineering conditions. Therefore, increases in prices
and/or better technology increase oil proved reserves.


                                                     5
(tmb) in 1993 to 1687.9 tmb in 2013 (BP, 2014). Which represents reserves 62% bigger
than 1993 and 27% bigger than 2003. Increase in proved reserves made the R/P (proved
reserves/production) of World be stable in values larger than 40 years since 1980, in 2013
the value of R/P is 53.3 years. It means that if nothing changes (technology, prices,
consumption and discoveries), oil would last 53 years. This increase of R/P means that
incorporation of proved reserves happened faster than increase in consumption (consump-
tion increased 52% in the last 30 years, while proved reserves increased 62%).
    Even with these good news for energy security, environmental concerns has gained
a more important role, becoming a catalyst for changes toward a low carbon economy.
In this context, ethanol from sugar cane seems to be a good option in the medium run.
Changes toward clean energy have been constrained by costs, roughly it is possible to say
that there is a trade-off between clean and cheap energy, and ethanol from sugarcane is
a significant improvement regarding environmental and an alternative close in costs com-
paring with other alternative energies.
    Here is important to point out that, if biofuels are being considered supported using
environmental arguments, different crops have distinct energy balances and sugar cane is a
better option regarding costs, land intensity and fossil balance related to corn (US produc-
tion) and also regarding sugarbeet (Europe production) (Goldemberg and Guardabassi,
2010). Hence, we can say that ethanol from sugarcane are "cleaner" than other crops, and
also it has a smaller impact on competition with food (once it is less land intensive).

   Notes: a) Energy output in a liter of ethanol over fossil fuel energy need to be produced.
   So, with one liter fossil fuel in Brazil it is possible to produce around seven times more
   ethanol than in US. This difference is due intensity in fertilizers of US production
   comparing with Brazilian one.

    Whatever the motivation is (support local farms, environment, energy security), know-
ing elasticities of ethanol and gasoline demand are key assets. Policies aimed in increase
local farmers´ demand for ethanol in Brazil and/or to reduce gasoline consumption should
properly consider the role of both prices (ethanol and gasoline) on these demands. Income
elasticities are also variables of interest to recognize the short terms shifts and to be used
by private and public sectors. More than these two key variables, Brazil also brings the
importance of cross elasticities to fuel demand estimations. Depending on our answers
for elasticities, public policies could be better designed in a sense to figure if demands are
price sensitive, which price is more sensitive, whether income increases will be followed by
increases in fuel consumption, and in what extent.

2.2       Light Fuels in Brazil
Brazil is a special country regarding light fuels market. Because Brazilian fleet is com-
posed by around 52% of cars that are able to use ethanol or gasoline, or a blend of two
fuels (flex fuel cars), there is a need to include the alternative fuel price regarding both
demands (ethanol and gasoline). Hence, not just the own price and income elasticities are
important for Brazilian light fuel demand, but also the cross price elasticities. Studying
changes and differences between Brazil and the rest of world could help to understand the
impact of future and current biofuels policies.
    Biofuels policies in Brazil started motivated by: i) reduction on oil dependence; ii)
supporting local farmers with the increase of ethanol demand. Reduction of oil depen-
dence was associated with a balance trade problem, with increases in oil prices (1970s), oil
importers had their value of imports increased. During 1980s, with the fall of oil prices,
interest on biofuel policies decreased in Brazil and around the world. At present, with
Brazilian oil discoveries and agricultural commodities being exported, the arguments of
energy security and balance trade were weakened, being local farmers support and the
green fuel motivation stronger arguments nowadays.
    These policies resulted in one of the most cleaner energy matrices in the world, with
more than 46% of primary energy production coming from renewable sources in 2013
(EPE, 2014), from which 19% of total primary energy coming from sugar cane prod-
ucts. The statement that ethanol is an economically feasible alternative for oil in Brazil
should be better explained. Ethanol is competitive with gasoline in Brazil though a whole
institutional arrangement which is mainly composed by:
       • Government Mandates - If nothing of hydrated ethanol is bought by flex fuel con-
         sumers, if they bought just gasoline, there is still 27% of anhydrous ethanol mixed
         in gasoline, which guarantees scale to producers;
       • Car subsidies - Taxes on Industrialized Products (IPI)5 are different between flex
         fuel cars and gasoline cars. The only situation when there are the same level of taxes
         for flex fuel and gasoline cars are for cars until 1000cc. For cars with larger engines
         (more than 1000cc) IPI tax is higher for pure gasoline cars than for flex fuel cars. It
         clearly increases potential demand for ethanol;
       • Subsidies directly on fuels - There is a higher tax burden on gasoline than hydrated
         ethanol in Brazil (Jales and Costa, 2014). For state of São Paulo, for example, taxes
         were roughly 21% of final price for ethanol and 42% for gasoline.
Other interesting point is that ethanol is not homogeneously competitive across Brazilian
states. One illustration can be done comparing purchase prices, the difference between the
average purchase prices in the most expensive and in the cheapest state, which achieved
56% at ethanol market and just 13% at gasoline market. It illustrates a larger price dis-
persion in the ethanol regional markets. In some extent, these differences across states are
due to logistic bottlenecks. In region North, for example, just a few states have ethanol
prices competitive against gasoline ones. We constructed a map with the percentage of
periods that gasoline is more competitive than ethanol6 (Map (a) - Figure 1). The Map

    Ethanol has a lower energy content than gasoline, so to compare both prices we should multiply
gasoline price by a constant of 0.7. Hence, if EthanolP rice/GasolineP rice > 0.7 , it means that gasoline
is more competitive. Otherwise, ethanol is more competitive.

    Consumption ratio between ethanol and gasoline (Cr ) is defined here by the share of
ethanol of each state in the Brazilian market (Es ), divided by gasoline participation (Gs ).
If (Cr ) = 1, it means that the state´s consumption of gasoline and ethanol has the same
pattern of consumption as the whole country. In the North (far from the largest consumer
markets) the share (Cr ) is 0.23, and hydrated ethanol consumption of those states are
around 1.41% of total, while gasoline consumption is around 6.11% of total. Meanwhile,
state of São Paulo8 , the major producer and consumer has the share around 2.23, con-
suming 60% of ethanol and 27% of gasoline. These data show that even the government
in Brazil sells the idea that ethanol could be an international commodity, with the actual
oil prices, but it is competitive just in a few Brazilian states (close to producers), not in
all of them.

3.1   Literature Instruments
In order to achieve equilibrium is natural a back and forth between supply and demand
curves. Regarding a agricultural commodity for example, some increase in demand gen-
erates higher prices, higher prices increase supply, higher supply decreases prices, keeping
other variables constant. Because price and quantity are equilibrium points of both curves
and they are moving across time it could be a source of endogeneity, do not allowing cor-
rect estimation of demand and supply curves. There is a possibility to say that fuel price
is exogenous if there is aninfinity elastic supply curve, not price sensible. Apparently it
is not true for large countries. Anderson (2012), for example, argues that the pricing
strategies at gas station level is not a function of short-term shift demand, so US retailers
follow follow the same strategy, arguing that gasoline price is constructed just as function
of oil prices without feedback process.
    The most usual is to treat price as an endogenous variable as did by Liu (2014) and
Hughes et al. (2008). The major bias source would be the positive correlation between
demand and prices, biasing error and creating a toward zero bias. In a simple equation,
endogeneity could be visualized as:

                                 y = β0 + β1 x1 + β2 x2 + ... + βk xk + µ,
                       E(µ) = 0,    Cov(xj , µ) = 0,   j = 1, 2, ..., k − 1.             (1)

     Note that the exogenous variables (Cov(xj , µ) = 0) go until xk−1 because xk is our
endogenous estimator. Be endogenous in an econometric sense means to be correlated
with error term and not be generated out of the model. This feedback between model
and variable makes impossible to properly verify the marginal effects, in other words
Cov(xk , µ) 6= 0 is not a problem just for βk , but for all βj . We cannot consistently esti-
mate Equation (1) using OLS.
     In some estimations of gasoline demand is possible to find results inconsistent theo-
retically, as positive price elasticities or total price demands inelastic (Noll, 2013). The
major reason for that is that demand increases are followed by price increases, creating a
contemporaneous positive correlation between prices and demand, biasing estimators. In
order to solve that, IV approach indicates that we need at least one valid instrument
(z1 ) for each endogenous variable (Wooldridge, 2010, p. 89). Valid instruments have to
assure two features: i) an exogenous instrument (Cov(z1 , µ)) = 0); ii) a different from zero
correlation between z1 and xk . Frequently, the practical concern is a tradeoff between rele-
vance and exogeneity of instruments. The relevance of instrument is usually interpreted as
different from zero partially correlation between instrument and the endogenous variable,
once the coefficient of z1 in xk equation, θ1 , need to be different from zero:

                   xk = δ0 + δ1 x1 + δ2 x2 + ... + δK−1 xK−1 + θ1 z1 + rK                (2)

    The Equation (2) is considered as the first stage of an IV approach and its estimation
should have E(rk ) = 0 and rk uncorrelated with its explanatory variables. Regarding
our instruments, for instance, it is easy to find significant coefficients, so we have strong
instruments. The major problem is to find really exogenous instruments.
    According to the literature, it is important to have in mind if database is a time series
or a panel data. This feature makes a large difference for the instrument choice. Are

international sugar prices good instruments for ethanol prices9 ? Depending on the type of
database, for time series, the answer would be yes, but for panel data with time-effects, the
answer would be negative. In a panel data with time effects, there is no reason to include
a instrument with no variation intra-panel, this instrument will be cancelled, redundant,
with time-effects. The same explanation is used to justify why international oil prices are
not good instruments for gasoline prices at state level panel data.
    Ramsey et al. (1975) and Dahl (1979) used other refinery goods as kerosene or diesel
to instrument the gasoline price, but it is likely correlated being used as price demand
instrument(Noll, 2013).
    Following the literature in the attempts to find good instruments, Liu (2014) argues
that the prices of other states can be used as instruments. They are correlated by supply
side, being a good instrument for prices in each state, so the author used average price
of non adjacent states. This approach is close in spirit to the use of some lagged spatial
variable, but in spatial econometrics is more common to use information of closer states
but the more distant ones.


3.2    Our Instruments
The hard task to find a good instrument for prices, a common attempt would be to get
some instrument candidates from the supply side. This is the motivation to use oil prices
as instrument for gasoline demand and sugar prices for ethanol demand (in a time series
approach). Oil prices are one of most important costs for gasoline and the sugar price is
an important component in the opportunity cost to produce ethanol.
    Here we used purchase prices of diesel, gasoline and ethanol to construct our in-
struments. Therefore, our instruments are an average prices where just the prices of
non-adjacent states are computed. We depart from a matrix of Ones (27 x 27) and re-
duced a Queen-1 matrix (27 x 27) from that. After that we row standard the results to
get our NN-1 matrix. Then, NN-1 pre multiply prices matrix (27 x 162) to construct
our instruments. This procedure is repeated also for Queen-2 contingency matrix (just to
check if results are sensible to matrix choice).
    Regarding positive contemporaneous correlation between demand and prices, we also
used lagged prices trying to achieve more exogenous instruments. The justification here is
that the farther temporally is the variable, the lower is the probability that this variable
is correlated with error term in the mainly equation (second stage).
    Because gasoline in Brazil is a blend (27% anhydrous ethanol + 73% gasoline) there
is also the possibility of hydrated ethanol prices being endogenous in gasoline demand:
increases in gasoline demand increases demand for anhydrous ethanol, which increases
prices of anhydrous and hydrated ethanol. We believe that neglecting this problem leads
to toward zero bias in ethanol prices in the gasoline demand, presenting insignificance in
ethanol price estimated parameters. Hence, we also tested endogeneity of ethanol prices
on gasoline demand.

   9
    In Brazil the mainly crop used to ethanol production is sugarcane and there is a little arbitrage choice
regarding the firms production, some firms can change the production between sugar and ethanol. So,
the sugar price is relevant for the ethanol supply.

3.3    Model and Summary Statistics
Around the world is common to include population as a control for fuel demand. But
is not a good option to capture the real fleet effects in Brazil. Because it is a middle
income country, the fleet has changing in relation with population. In 2000 there were 8.4
people/vehicle, eleven years later this ratio was around 4 people/vehicle. Just to compare,
US has a ratio around 1.25 people/vehicle, losing just for Monaco and San Marino10 . We
used the Denatran database to construct our fleet variable.
    The other variables used to estimate fuel demand are the prices (own prices and sub-
stitute prices) and income proxies. Then, the basic model is:

           First Stage :
                                              P1it = δ0 + exogenous + instruments + υit                 (3)
       Second Stage :
                 Qjit = β1j P̂1it + β2j P2it + β3j Incit + β4j F leetjit + β5j F leet(ratio)it ∗ P1it
                    +β6j F leet(ratio)it ∗ P2itj + regional ef f ects + time ef f ects + εit


                            j = gasoline, ethanol;            i = 1, 2, ..., N ;     t = 1, 2..., T.    (4)

    The equation above is used to estimate both demands. The database is a panel data
(N T ) where N varies from 1 to 27 (number of sates in Brazil) and t varies from 1 to
162 (being 1 related to July/2001 and 162 to Dec/2014), so we have a panel with 4374
observations (N.T ).
    The quantities in the data set (Qjit ) are the hydrated ethanol and gasoline-c sold at
gas stations in barrel of oil equivalent quantities. Gasoline prices and ethanol prices
are the monthly weighted averages of consumer prices provided by National Agency for
Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofues (ANP). The income proxy used here was a state-level
tax (ICMS11 ). We are using ICMS instead of electrical consumption proxy for two rea-
sons: i) do not input a fix effect12 . ii) IMCS is a better proxy than energy consumption
mainly because of technological changes towards energy-savings and environmental con-
cerns which likely decrease the correlation between them (GDP and energy consumption).

    We also have purchase prices of ethanol, gasoline and diesel, and these prices are
weighted by the sales of each gas station and are provided by National Agency for
Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofues (ANP). We will use these prices as instruments for
gasoline and ethanol price. Trying to have more exogenous instruments we will use similar
strategy as Liu (2014), using just the prices of non-neighbors as instrument. So, "NN1"
is reference to price of non-neighbors, NN1 being non-neighbors of first order. The NN2
matrix, of second order are also used just for consistency tests.

4      Results
4.1     Preliminary Results
Regarding endogeneity issues we should to do two basic questions:
    i Is there an endogeneity problem?
 ii Is there a valid instrument?
    The first question we tried to answer using the Durbin-Wu-Hausman approach (test-
ing the consistency through differences between OLS and 2SLS estimators) and using
control function approach (including residuals of first stage regressions into second stage).
Using both approaches, own prices are endogenous in ethanol and gasoline demands, as
expected. We also have an intuition that ethanol price is endogenous in the gasoline
demand, so shocks on demand for gasoline could be transmitted to ethanol prices by
anhydrous ethanol channel. This channel causes negative contemporaneous correlations
between ethanol prices and gasoline demand, when we should expected positive correla-
tions. Hence, we also test the endogeneity of ethanol prices on gasoline demand. Another
way to achieve the same result is using the residuals of the first stage in the main re-
gression. If the coefficient of the estimated residuals is different from zero, we also have
endogeneity problems (Wooldridge, 2010, p. 130).Using both approaches, ethanol price
showed to be endogenous in both demands, and gasoline price is endogenous in its own
demand.
    After confirmed the endogeneity problem in both demands, we estimated these using
instruments for prices, but what we should expected from the results? First of all, we
would expect negative own prices elasticities, since we are estimating a demand curve and
not a supply one. Regarding all other key parameters (alternative fuel price, income and
fleet) we expected positive elasticities for gasoline demand, for example more income, fleet
or alternative fuel price, more demand for gasoline, ceteris paribus. More than these basic
expectations, we also expected more elastic prices and cross price parameters for ethanol

    Table 4 shows ethanol as an elastic good, which is a different feature from fuel market
abroad. Basically all results, including some surveys, found fuel market as a price inelastic
good (Ep < 1) (considering gasoline market). ). But it seems that ethanol market, mainly
because possibility of arbitrage regarding flex fuel cars, became a fuel market with less
inelastic price. Due to the used log-linear functional form, coefficients can be interpreted
directly as elasticities, so ethanol has elasticities around (−1.5) for the Brazilian market
and these results are at the top range of other elasticities estimations from the literature.
Literature range is between (−1.5) and (−1.2), being the higher values for the most re-
cent papers (Santos, 2013; Farina et al., 2010; Cardoso and Bittencourt, 2013; Freitas and
Kaneko, 2011).
    Regarding income elasticity estimations, we found values slight smaller than a unit,
indicating that expansion of income has a large impact on ethanol demand, comparable
with international average marginal effects. These income elasticities‘ results are larger
than the ones for the US and Europe, for example. Hughes et al. (2008)(USA) and Pock
(2007)(Europe), for example, did not find income elasticities larger than 0.52, even con-
sidering long run parameters. This follows the intuition that increases in income should
have smaller impact in high income level countries than middle income ones.

     Since 2006 there is no pure ethanol cars production, being that pure ethanol fleet is around of 2% and
tending to be zero in the long run.

    Other important point is the results’ robustness regarding instruments choice. Even
if we are not sure that ethanol purchase prices are the ideal instruments, the other two
instruments performed pretty close. Cross prices elasticities on ethanol demand and the
effects of gasoline prices were around a third of ethanol prices’ effects. This shows that
ethanol demand is more sensitive to its own price than gasoline demand.

    In the gasoline demand estimation (Table 5) all instruments also performed closely.
The difference is that in gasoline demand we used instruments for the own price and for
substitute good price (endogeneity with gasoline prices because of anhydrous portion into
gasoline). Therefore, in the second column estimates we have multicollinearity because
ethanol purchase prices are used for construction of both prices. This might be the reason
for ethanol price not being significant.
    Regarding own elasticities (gasoline prices’ parameters) we found higher elasticities
than international evidence, probably because of a combination among higher arbitrage
(flex fuel cars) and a smaller income in Brazil. Comparing with Brazilian evidence, we
found parameters close to (Santos, 2013)(Ep = −0.78), for example. The elasticities of
gasoline demand were roughly half of the ethanol elasticities. This may indicate that
ethanol demand is more price sensible than gasoline. It is an expected result because
ethanol demand is almost totally composed by flex fuel cars.
    Income parameters were almost the same for ethanol and gasoline demand estimations,
so the impacts from income increases would be the same for ethanol and gasoline demands.

4.2   Are the elasticities constant? The role of flex fuel cars
Most of the studies in the literature use log-linear specification for light fuel demand es-
timation. In addition to the facilities to interpret directly the parameters as elasticities,
come also the imposition that elasticities are constant for the whole sample. Therefore,
this assumption will be relaxed allowing different price and cross price elasticities along
the time. We also allowed differences into income elasticies, but it was around 0.8 for both
demands along the time.
    We would expect higher cross elasticities after the introduction of flex fuel cars, consid-
ering just the Brazilian market, and the current literature confirms that. But we believe
that there are mixed effects causing that: i) the older literature does not account for
endogeneity, thus tends to underestimate elasticities (as explained earlier, do not account
for endogeneity and has a toward zero bias into these demands); ii) flex fuel cars intro-
duction, tending to increase arbitrage between both fuels, increasing cross price and own
price elasticities, becoming fuel more price sensible. Hence, in order to account for changes
in elasticities during the time we interacted price and cross price parameters with time
dummies.
    Time dummy variables regarding 2006m1 and 2010m7 split our sample into 3 equal
periods. The justification to use 2006 and not 2003 (the beginning of flexfuel cars produc-
tion) is because flexfluel fleet was so small in 2003 that would not be important enough
to change elasticities. The proportion of flexfuel cars in the first period went from zero to
8% of total cars. In the end of the second period (2010) flex fuel cars reached 37%, and in
the end of our sample this proportion was around 52%. Another important event in 2006
was that flexfuel cars production exceeded gasoline cars’ production. Table 6 shows the
results of the estimates coefficients after re-parametrization.

     Ethanol price and cross price elasticities had a large increase from period 1 (2001m1-
2005m12) to period 2 (2006m1-2010m6), and the changes for period 3 were small. Other
important result is that in the period 1, cross price coefficient of ethanol demand shows an
insignificant result, but in the next two subsequent periods it showed significant results.
     The gasoline demand had the same behavior, with a larger increase in elasticities from
first to second period and just a little change from second to third period. Again, the
cross price coefficient was not significant in the first period, becoming significant in the
following periods. These results regarding cross price elasticities (for both ethanol and
gasoline) could be interpreted as the lack of power of substitution to change demand of
fuel without flex fuel cars (in the first period).

Notes: Intervals: Time 1: 2001m1-2005m12; Time 2: 2006m1-2010m6; Time 3: 2010m7-
2014m12.


    In terms of the choice of time used, we constructed around 90 regressions for each
demand consisting on subsample of 3-year observations. Because it is a moving window
sample, the first observations in the first sample is 2001m7-2004m6; the second is 2001m8-
2004m7, and so on. The most interesting result of this approach was that we could note
exactly when the cross price elasticites became significant, when the confidence interval of
cross price elasticities is above zero. It happens with subsamples from 2006m7 to 2009m6
for the ethanol demand, and from 2007m1 to 2009m12 for gasoline demand (Figure in
Appendix).



5      Final Remarks
Using purchase prices of non-neighbors for price instruments, we estimated the ethanol
and gasoline demands. The most important findings were:

    i) Ethanol (Ep = 1.5) and gasoline (Ep = 0.8) are price sensible, with higher elasticities
       than the elasticities in the US and Europe, for example. Hence, public policies driven
       by prices could be applied;

 ii) Cross elasticities were significant in both demands, so ethanol and gasoline are actually
     complementary goods for the Brazilian Market and any public policy addressed to
     one market should take into account spillovers to the other market. It is clear that
     this change occurred after the introduction of flex fuel cars introduction, since in
     the fist sub sample (small or zero flex fuel fleet) the cross price elasticities for both


                                              16
    demands were not significantly different from zero and in the second period they
    became significant and with the positive expected sign;

iii) Using a moving window sample we reached a most accurate threshold from where the
     cross elasticities were significant for both demands. In other words, in these intervals
     gasoline and ethanol are actually part of the same market;

iv) After the introduction of flex fuel cars, there were an increase in the own price elas-
    ticities in both demands;

 v) Accounting for endogeneity in both demands generated a larger elasticities coefficients
    for gasoline (comparing to previous literature addressed to Brazilian market), but
    quite similar results regarding ethanol demand.

Our price elasticities’ estimations are just an indicative of how prices could respond for
shocks. It is possible that the nature of the shock is important for demand responses. For
instance, Coglianese et al. (2015) argue that taxes changes could have a larger effect than
regular changes. In other words, 10% reduction on demand caused by oil costs would be
a smaller reduction on demand than the same increase driven by taxes. The reasons for
that would be the exposition of taxes changes in the media and the persistence of shocks
by taxes, media exposition and tax aversion by consumers.
    As the most demand studies, our results are exposed to the Lucas Critique. Even being
a short run estimate, the accuracy of the model depends on what the extent of changes is,
severe shocks increasing the possibility of parameters change and become harder to make
predictions.
