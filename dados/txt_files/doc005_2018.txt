Mill ‚Äì like father like son: Misunderstandings and revisions of classical trade theory1

Pedro Siqueira Machado2

Abstract:
There has been a renewed interest in classical trade theory for some years. This has been accompanied
by a shift in how researchers see Ricardo‚Äôs trade theory. The standard/Stuart Mill interpretation, while
usually giving credit to Ricardo for his developments, depicts him as erroneous or at least incomplete.
The new interpretation, which we shall call Sraffa-Ruffin, sees Ricardo as substantially different from
this. Neither a source of error nor incomplete. Even though the new literature puts emphasis in this
contrast, it is lacking an exposition of how Stuart Mill came to change Ricardo. Our work tries to
clarify this point. We have examined how James Mill made a mistake as he misinterpreted Ricardo.
During the correction, he left the international values undetermined. His son departed from this to
correct an error which he saw as being shared both by his father and Ricardo. Stuart Mill felt it was
justified to introduce the foreign idea of supply and demand as determinants of value. This was not
inconsequential.

interpreta√ß√£o padr√£o, embora geralmente d√™ cr√©dito a Ricardo por seus desenvolvimentos, o descreve

a nova literatura enfatize esse contraste, na nossa vis√£o falta uma exposi√ß√£o de como Stuart Mill

cometeu um erro ao interpretar Ricardo. Durante a corre√ß√£o, ele deixou os valores internacionais
indeterminados. Seu filho partiu disso para corrigir um erro que ele considerava compartilhado por
seu pai e Ricardo. Stuart Mill considerou justificado introduzir a ideia de oferta e demanda como
determinantes do valor. Isso n√£o foi inconsequente.

     1. Introduction
         Recently there has been an increasing flow of authors reinterpreting Ricardo‚Äôs trade theory. 3
They stem from Sraffa‚Äôs (1930) reply to Einaudi, and more specifically from Ruffin‚Äôs (2002)
rediscovery of this debate. Hence the name given in the literature: the ‚ÄúSraffa-Ruffin Interpretation‚Äù.
In this piece of work Sraffa tried to dispel some controversies that aroused amongst classical
economists regarding the theory of international trade. Controversies that had long lasting
consequences in the history of economic thought, even in the modern textbook presentation of the
‚ÄúRicardian Trade Theory‚Äù.
         To explore this issue an excursus is provided here into the history of ideas.4 The controversies
that Sraffa was interested in his 1930 paper relate to a mistake in the classical theory of trade. The
error was found in James Mill‚Äôs first and second editions of his Elements (Mill, 1821 and 1824), but
absent from its third edition (Mill, 1844[1826]). At first, Mill‚Äôs analysis went as if the terms of trade
could be different depending on what country was under scrutiny. England would trade its cloth for
Poland‚Äôs linen at a rate different from what Poland would do the reverse. This is clearly unfeasible.
The revision for the third edition reveals that James Mill implicitly accepted that the original
formulation was wrong, without offering a full solution for the problem. It was still incomplete in the
sense that it could not determine the terms of trade.
         It was Stuart Mill who picked up from where his father had left and proposed a closure. It
involved the introduction of a foreign concept into the classical framework for value determination.
He said he had to ‚Äúfall back upon an antecedent law, that of supply and demand‚Äù (Mill, 1968[1871],
p. 596) to determine the terms of trade. However, it not only had analytical implications but it also
trickled down into the understanding of history of thought. Because in doing so, Stuart Mill (1844)
went further back and said that the error and incompleteness could be traced to Ricardo‚Äôs exposition
in his Principles (Works, vol. 1).5
         Sraffa‚Äôs goals in the aforementioned paper were very modest and did not involve a coherent
reworking of Ricardo‚Äôs trade theory. He mainly wanted to question the validity of attributing the error
to Ricardo. Sraffa‚Äôs thesis is that Ricardo‚Äôs construct was categorically different from both James
Mill and Stuart Mill. The recent literature after Ruffin‚Äôs rediscovery (see footnote 3) have been
erected on this difference and the implications that emerge. Basically, clearing up the fact that
Ricardo‚Äôs exposition was neither erroneous nor incomplete. Apart from misapprehensions, it did not
require the introduction of ‚Äúantecedent laws‚Äù.
         Even though this contrast between Ricardo and the Mills is crucial, little effort has been put
into analysing how the error appeared in James Mill and how his son dealt with it. This is not to say
that nothing has been said about it in almost two centuries, but rather that the new understanding of
Ricardo might help shine new light on the matter. The present work aims at filling this gap by
clarifying James Mill‚Äôs problem and his son solution. It is an assessment of both James Mill and
Stuart Mill after the Sraffa-Ruffin interpretation. We will follow their examples, specifically the one
present in both authors in which England and Germany trade cloth and linen. The paper is structured
in four sections.
         To do this, we will construct a basic classical framework and formalize some of its
propositions. This will establish the foundations from where we can start analysing both authors. The
first section deals with this basic setting. Following an interpretation of the trade example as dealing
with trade in non-basic commodities (cloth and linen), we will introduce a non-tradable basic good
in each country (good ùë§ below). This has the advantage of showing explicitly some conditions that
must be met if goods are to be produced domestically in any economy.

  This is a very brief and superficial remark on a much more complex subject. The idea is to provide a short panorama
from which to proceed. The full story involves many other authors that I have chosen to leave out.

  All references to Ricardo will be made according to the Sraffa edition of his works. Specifically, the online edition
available at http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/159. We will indicate the respective volume and page number when
appropriate.
                                                                                                          3

         A discussion will follow on how classical economics determines relative prices and
distribution. The relevant data taken are the structure of production, real wages, and the output level.
The notion of competition is what gives coherence to those concepts. We will assume a pure labour
economy, with commodities produced by means of unassisted labour. This means that the only capital
advanced is the wages. It will allow us to derive some conditions that must be met in each country
(England and Germany) separately.
         From there, we will introduce the idea that countries might be open for trade. This is the
second section. So, each country has the option of either producing certain goods domestically or
importing them. Two general propositions can be formalized. The first one regards the conditions
necessary for a country to benefit from foreign trade. The second, and related one, is about when both
countries can derive benefits from trade.
         The third section will deal with James Mill‚Äôs work. Given the framework established in the
first two sections, it is possible to see what was the error he faced in the first two editions of his book.
Eventually, the error was spotted and the third edition was revised to cover the mistake. However,
this left an open question. The determination of the terms of trade was absent.
         In the fourth section we will evaluate Stuart Mill‚Äôs contribution. He could close the question
his father had left open. In doing so, however, he introduced a series of unfamiliar concepts to
classical economics. We will try to clarify why and how significant it was his decision to ‚Äúfall back
upon an antecedent law, that of supply and demand‚Äù (Mill, 1968[1871], p. 596). It is no coincidence
that the chapter where he introduces it has been called the ‚Äúgreat chapter‚Äù by Edgeworth and endorsed
by other marginalist economists. After all, marginalism relies on supply and demand to explain
almost, if not all, phenomena of economic life.
         There are two goals in pursuing this kind of research, both relating to Sraffa‚Äôs research agenda.
The first, obvious one, is a revaluation of history of economic thought. This point in particular might
help clarify how Stuart Mill was a key author in the transition from classical to marginal economics.
The second, less clear one, is about recreating classical economics after Sraffa‚Äôs intervention (Sraffa,
1960). If, for example, we want to set up a ‚ÄúSraffian‚Äù trade theory then we might want to go back and
understand how the classical economists dealt with it. This procedure has the advantage of showing
clearly what was the problems they faced and how it fits into the greater picture.

     2. Classical framework
          Here we will follow the reconstruction of classical economics offered by Sraffa (1960) and
pursued by some of his disciples (e.g. Garegnani, 1984). According to this line of interpretation,
classical economics starts from an idea of a given productive structure, real wages, and the output
level to determine relative prices and distribution. From a given productive structure a combination
of material inputs and labour is used to make a commodity. We have taken the procedure of reducing
this all to labour: the only input is direct labour. This does not mean that classical economics is defined
by a pure labour economy, as the conventional treatment of Ricardian Trade Theory tends to say (see,
for example, Chipman, 1965; Krugman, 2002). However, the labour theory of value has well known
deficiencies that are unrelated to international trade. By restricting the analysis to only labour as input
we can side step those problems.
          Having established this, the assumptions of a given level of output and productive structure
boil down to a known amount of labour to produce a given output. So, we know for every commodity
ùëñ its scale of production (ùëãùëñ ) and how much labour it uses (ùêøùëñ ):
ùêøùëñ ‚Üí ùëãùëñ

         We can readily scale down to find the amount of labour required to produce one unit (however
this is defined) of the commodity, or the labour coefficient:
ùêøùëñ
   = ùëôùëñ ‚Üí 1 ùë¢ùëõùëñùë° ùëúùëì ùëñ
ùëãùëñ
                                                                                                          4

        The assumption of a given real wage translates into a pre-determined amount of good(s) that
goes to workers. In classical economics this was usually done by referring to a minimum subsistence
wage to sustain and reproduce workers. Ricardo argued that: ‚ÄúThe natural price of labour is that price
which is necessary to enable the labourers, one with another, to subsist and to perpetuate their race‚Äù
(Ricardo, Works, vol. 1, p. 90). This should not be read as a purely biological determination of wages,
as Ricardo a few pages later remarks ‚ÄúIt is not to be understood that the natural price of labour,
estimated even in food and necessaries, is absolutely fixed and constant. (‚Ä¶) It essentially depends
on the habits and customs of the people‚Äù (p. 92). So, there is a social and historical aspect to it.6
Workers across sectors will face the same real wage. Any difference in quality of labour will be
expressed as a higher or lower coefficient of general labour.
        Consider first wages and prices for England, denoted by the superscript ùê∏. What is relevant
for us is that this basket of goods that workers can secure is defined prior to the determination of
prices. Simplifying the matter, assume that they only consume one generic commodity, call it
commodity 1. In modern terminology this is the same as having only one basic good. Then, the
monetary wages the workers receive (ùë§ ùê∏ ) must be enough to pay for this amount of commodity 1.
Let ùëù1ùê∏ be its price and ùëè1ùê∏ the amount of it workers can secure:
 ùë§ ùê∏ = ùëè1ùê∏ . ùëù1ùê∏                                                                     (1)

        From there is possible to find the price of production. This is defined as the price for one unit
that is enough to cover the costs of production and a normal profit rate over advanced capital. By
assumption, capital advanced consists only of labour, or more precisely of the basket of goods
advanced to workers. This implies that the price of production for good 1 is:
 ùëù1ùê∏ = ùë§ ùê∏ . ùëô1ùê∏ (1 + ùëü ùê∏ )                                                           (2)

         This is one equation in three variables (ùëù1ùê∏ , ùë§ ùê∏ , and ùëü ùê∏ ). However, equation ( 1 ) establishes
ùë§ ùê∏ as a function of ùëù1ùê∏ . It is possible to reduce to number of variables even further by making the
price of good 1 the numeraire (ùëù1ùê∏ = 1). This is enough to find the rate of profits attainable according
to that structure:
        1 ‚àí ùëè1ùê∏ . ùëô1ùê∏
 ùëüùê∏ =                                                                                (3)
           ùëè1ùê∏ . ùëô1ùê∏

        This can be interpreted as the quantity of good 1 that is left for capitalists, net of workers
consumption, per unit of capital advanced. In this scenario the profits are determined as a residual
magnitude. This is more properly defined as the surplus this economy can generate, which can be
divided amongst different classes. Since we have included only workers and capitalists in our
construction, it will be entirely absorbed by capitalists as profits.
        We shall now introduce two other goods. Call them cloth (ùê∂) and linen (ùêø). These will become
the tradable goods once we allow for trade to occur. They are, by assumption, not part of wage goods.
From the same kind reasoning used for good 1, we can define the prices of production for both goods:
ùëùùê∂ùê∏ = ùë§ ùê∏ . ùëôùê∂ùê∏ (1 + ùëüùê∂ùê∏ )
ùëùùêøùê∏ = ùë§ ùê∏ . ùëôùêøùê∏ (1 + ùëüùêøùê∏ )

         There is something lacking in those equations. They only say that, if wages are paid according
to ùë§ ùê∏ , the sectoral rate of profit will vary according to the good‚Äôs monetary price. Alternatively, the
capitalist in a specific sector will be able to guarantee a given profit rate if (s)he is able to keep the
price at an appropriate level. The question that remains is: is there a magnitude towards which those
variables tend to adjust to?

                                                                                                                          5

       This piece was supplemented through the theoretical distinction between ‚Äúmarket‚Äù and
‚Äúnormal‚Äù prices. Adam Smith argued that normal prices are characterized by normal wages, rents,
and profits:

         When the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than what is sufficient to pay the
         rent of the land, the wages of the labour, and the profits of the stock employed in raising,
         preparing, and bringing it to market, according to their natural rates, the commodity is then
         sold for what may be called its natural price. (Smith, 2001[1776], p. 83)

         This is the magnitude towards which market prices will gravitate. In contrast, market prices
will depend on circumstantial elements that cannot be the object of scientific enquiry. We have
excluded land rent from the analysis. Normal wages reflect the choice of a given basket for workers
consumption. The one that remains to be defined is the notion of a normal profit rate.
         It is conceivable that capitalists will seek the highest rate of profit they can attain, regardless
of what they are producing. In a capitalist system, what regulates production is exchangeable value.
This is, getting the most one can from realizing your production. As a corollary, the resting position
has to be a situation in which every sector renders the same rate of profit. Otherwise, capitalists will
migrate their capital from one sector to another. This movement, or force, justifies setting a
homogeneous rate of profit in the economy. This is what we are calling the normal rate of profit. That
is the notion of free competition adopted by classical economists and it is what gives coherence to
their theory (Eatwell, 1982). As Stuart Mill puts it ‚Äúonly through the principle of competition has
political economy any pretension to the character of a science‚Äù (1968[1871], p. 239).
         Equation ( 3 ) establishes the highest rate of profit obtainable in the production of the wage
good, for a given real wage. The normal profit rate cannot be higher than this without putting the
reproduction of the economy in jeopardy. Otherwise capitalists would have no interest in producing
this good and, therefore, workers could not feed themselves. It cannot remain persistently below it as
well. Since capitalists would forgo the production of other goods and concentrate their capital in this
sector, the general profit rate would still be the one in sector 1. There remains no other option than to
say that ‚Äúit is the profits of the farmer which regulate the profits of all other trades‚Äù (Ricardo, Works,
vol. 6, p. 117). An idea shared also with James Mill: ‚ÄúThe return which is made to capital employed
upon the land, is that which determines the rate of annual profit from all other employments of capital‚Äù
(Mill, 1844[1826], p. 47). Ricardo maintained this idea in his ‚ÄúEssay on Profits‚Äù (Works, vol. 4, pp.
6-26).7
         The prices of production for cloth and linen can then be rewritten as:
 ùëùùê∂ùê∏ = ùë§ ùê∏ . ùëôùê∂ùê∏ (1 + ùëü ùê∏ )
                                                                                       (4)
 ùëùùêøùê∏ = ùë§ ùê∏ . ùëôùêøùê∏ (1 + ùëü ùê∏ )

       Which are just the previous equations with normal profit rates. Plugging in the ùëü ùê∏ from
equation ( 3 ) and after some algebraic manipulation we find that:
 ùëùùê∂ùê∏ ùëôùê∂ùê∏
    =                                                                         (5)
 ùëùùêøùê∏ ùëôùêøùê∏

       This implies that if both goods are to be produced domestically then their relative prices shall
conform to the ratio of embodied labour. For whatever other magnitude different from this, it is
                                                                                                          ùê∏
                                                                                                         ùëùùê∂      ùëôùê∏
impossible that both will exhibit the normal rate of profit. What we mean is that if                           ‚â† ùëôùê∂ùê∏ then at
                                                                                                         ùëùùêøùê∏      ùêø
least one of the sectors will not be able to achieve ùëü ùê∏ , according to equations ( 4 ) above. We can
rewrite this relationship in a slightly modified way. This will help clarify some points when we
analyse Stuart Mill‚Äôs contribution:

        These set of relations must be respected if cloth and linen are to be produced in this country.
Conditions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are equivalent, notice that the former can be obtained by dividing both
equations in the latter. This modified condition states the existing constrains on monetary prices of
cloth and linen, which depends on the price level for the wage good. For whatever monetary price of
commodity 1, the monetary price of cloth and linen have to be as in ( 6 ) if a normal rate of profit is
to be observed in their production. Any deviation from this will imply a different sectoral profit rate
and, if unimpeded, the mechanism of competition discussed above will start to work.

as in England or not. This would not change the conclusions drawn above.

     3. Enter trade
        We shall now allow for international trade to take place. Classical economists relied on a
specific group of assumptions when dealing with trade. Our first step is to clarify some of those. From
there, we can justify some general propositions. This will set the stage for a proper analysis of James
Mill and Stuart Mill in the following sections.
        The classical analysis of international trade differed from the national scope with respect to
the mobility of capital and labour. While in any specific country or region, as we have seen above, it
is true that there are forces leading to the equality of profit rates and wages, in the international
scenario this force is absent. This implies that profit rates and/or wages can be persistently different
between countries. As Stuart Mill puts it: ‚Äúbetween different countries, profits may continue
different‚Äù (1968[1871], p. 588). Also, a long quotation from Ricardo may be helpful:

         In one and the same country, profits are, generally speaking, always on the same level; or
         differ only as the employment of capital may be more or less secure and agreeable. It is not
         so between different countries. If the profits of capital employed in Yorkshire, should exceed
         those of capital employed in London, capital would speedily move from London to Yorkshire,
         and an equality of profits would be effected; but if in consequence of the diminished rate of
         production in the lands of England, from the increase of capital and population, wages should
         rise, and profits fall, it would not follow that capital and population would necessarily move
         from England to Holland, or Spain, or Russia, where profits might be higher. (Works, vol. 1,
         p. 113)

      In terms of the framework set up in the previous section, the profit rate in England and
Germany will not converge (nor the basket of goods consumed by workers). This persistent difference
                                                                                                                              7

will not trigger flows of capitals between the countries from capitalists seeking to maximize their
profits.8 In general, the long-period position will be characterized by ùëü ùê∏ ‚â† ùëü ùê∫ .
          Another assumption usually made is that balanced trade is the only stable position. A country
can only pay for its imports with revenue received by exporting. In a barter system as Stuart Mill
conceptualizes (1968[1871], book 3, chap. 17), is hard to conceive trade occurring outside of this
equilibrium. There is a correspondent import for whatever good that is sent as export, and vice-versa.
However, the equilibrium position does not change when one includes money into the analysis and
hence the possibility of non-balanced trade. There will be a mechanism that acts to bring the system
back to equilibrium, namely the gold-flow.
          Another common feature of trade theories is the acknowledgment that prices of tradable goods
must be the same across countries, discounting transport costs. We shall call it the law of one price.
Obviously, this is true when evaluating the prices in a common standard, since one dollar is not the
same as one euro and so on and so forth. From this it also follows that relative prices of tradable
goods will be the same. So, their relative prices will follow the terms of trade, for whatever magnitude
this is. In the case of two commodities traded, Stuart Mill asserts: ‚Äúthe two commodities will exchange
for each other at the same rate of interchange in both countries‚Äù (1968[1871], p. 595). In terms of the
example of cloth and linen, we will represent this common international relative price as ùëùùê∂ /ùëùùêø . We
shall call it ‚Äúinternational relative prices‚Äù, ‚Äúterms of trade‚Äù, or ‚Äúinternational values‚Äù interchangeably.
          There is enough ground now to ascertain a few general propositions. The first one regards the
conditions that make a country benefit from trade. Any country will benefit from trade if the ratio of
export to import prices is higher than its own ratio of costs of production. For example, England can
                                                                                   ùëùùê∏      ùëùùê∂
benefit from exporting cloth and importing linen if, and only if, ùëùùê∂ùê∏ <                         . This implies that the ratio at
                                                                                   ùêø       ùëùùêø
which England can ‚Äútransform‚Äù cloth into linen is higher in the international market than in the
domestic one. For a given quantity of cloth it could obtain more linen by means of importation than
by producing it itself.
       To illustrate this, suppose a given quantity of cloth (ùëÑùê∂ ) owned by some English man. If
England produces both goods the relative prices will be equivalent to its cost ratio. Then, anyone in
                                                                                                                   ùëùùê∏
possession of this amount could obtain a certain quantity of linen (ùëÑùêø ) given by: ùëÑùêø = ùëùùê∂ùê∏ ùëÑùê∂ . Now
                                                                                                                    ùêø
                                                                                                                        ùëùùê∏   ùëùùê∂
let‚Äôs assume it can trade with other countries and in doing so it is faced with terms of trade ùëùùê∂ùê∏ <                              .
                                                                                                                        ùêø    ùëùùêø
Then, the same quantity ùëÑùê∂ would command a different quantity ùëÄùêø of linen in the international
                                  ùëù
market. This will be such as ùëÄùêø = ùëùùê∂ ùëÑùê∂ . It is easy to see that if the terms of trade are as we have
                                                              ùêø
assumed then ùëÄùêø > ùëÑùêø .9 If the terms of trade were different, then England would benefit from

 Other authors working in the classical tradition have questioned this assumption. For example, Shaikh has extensively
worked with models where countries‚Äô normal profit rates converge (in a recent contribution see Shaikh, 2016, chap. 11).
Since our goal is to examine specific contributions, we ought to stay as close to their assumptions as possible. Therefore,
we will not question the validity of doing so.

  This proves that there are country wide benefits from trade. Which is the level of analysis classical economists worked
with. As Faccarello (2017) argues, in a capitalist system the decisions of production are undertaken by capitalists that
wish to maximize their profits. Hence, a country will partake in international trade if its capitalists are in a better position
producing the exportable than otherwise.
This will be true. Take for example the case in which England benefits from trade by exporting cloth and importing linen.
We have seen that at those relative prices the equalization of profit rates cannot be maintained (condition ( 5 ) above).
For given real wages, the profit rate that could be obtained in each sector would be implicitly defined according to:

         It is important to notice that the benefits England can gain from international trade are
independent of Germany‚Äôs cost ratios. They rely solely on the English cost ratios and the terms of
trade. A disregard for this point has been used to attack Ricardo‚Äôs trade model in the history of
economic thought. For example, Chipman (1965, p. 479) argues that Ricardo‚Äôs famous example of
England and Portugal trading cloth and wine is problematic. This would be because Ricardo finds
that England can benefit from trade before saying anything about Portugal, which would be ‚Äúa non-
sequitur‚Äù (ibid.).
         Chipman fails to notice that for Ricardo, as Sraffa (1930) has shown, the terms of trade are
given. This would be enough to derive the benefits of trade, in line with what we have done above.
This is even more striking once one realize that in the next page the author shows a clear
understanding of this point when he defends Torrens against Jacob Hollander‚Äôs criticism. He argues
that ‚Äúwhat Torrens was comparing was the cost ratio in one country with the international price ratio;
this made it possible for Torrens to provide a correct argument for the gains from trade‚Äù (Chipman,
1965, p. 480). From what we have argued, this would be the only proper way of assessing a country‚Äôs
gain from trade at any point. The problem then must rest in not seeing the given terms of trade in
Ricardo (see footnote 3 for a recent literature on Ricardo). To be fair, Chipman (1965) argues that
‚ÄúRicardo‚Äôs exposition (‚Ä¶) [is] not free from ambiguity‚Äù (p. 479). He is also not completely sure
‚ÄúWhether or not this is a correct interpretation of Ricardo‚Äù (p. 483). He justifies the interpretation by
saying that ‚Äúthe solution happens to correspond precisely to that which was later obtained by [Stuart]
Mill‚Äù. This emphasizes the esteem Stuart Mill‚Äôs interpretation of Ricardo has had in the history of
economic thought.
         We can formalize now a second proposition, regarding mutual benefit from trade. We have
seen the conditions for a country to choose to trade internationally. However, a country can only trade
with others if it is beneficial for the other country to do the opposite transaction. In terms of our
example, England can only export cloth and import linen (or vice-versa) if Germany also gains from
this exchange. To be more precise, Germany cannot be worse off by entering trade. This sets the
interval for the terms of trade in which both countries can benefit.
         From conditions ( 5 ) and ( 8 ) above we know the relative prices that would have to rule in
England and Germany, respectively. Those would be the only ones that ensure a domestic normal
profit rate in the production of both cloth and linen. In general, those two cost ratios will be different.
                       ùê∏
                      ùëùùê∂      ùëùùê∫
This implies that           ‚â† ùëùùê∂ùê∫. Whoever has the lowest relative cost in a good we shall say that has a
                      ùëùùêøùê∏      ùêø
comparative advantage in producing that good. Without loss of generality, we can set England to have
a comparative advantage in the production of cloth. Consequently, Germany will have a comparative
                                                                                 ùëùùê∏     ùëùùê∫
advantage in the production of linen. This can be summarized as ùëùùê∂ùê∏ < ùëùùê∂ùê∫.
                                                                                  ùêø      ùêø
      In this scenario it would only be possible to have England producing and exporting cloth and
Germany linen. This is, if trade is to occur at all. If, for example, the terms of trade are such that
England would rather produce and export linen it would also mean that Germany would rather
                                   ùëù       ùëùùê∏   ùëùùê∫
produce and export linen (ùëùùê∂ < ùëùùê∂ùê∏ < ùëùùê∂ùê∫). So, it would be a situation in which both countries want to
                                       ùêø   ùêø    ùêø
export the same good. In a two country two commodity world this would be absurd and no trade
could happen. The same problem would appear if the terms of trade would induce Germany to export
cloth. Therefore, trade has to be with England exporting cloth and Germany exporting linen.
Otherwise no trade will happen and the countries will act as in autarky.
       The terms of trade would have to fall into a specific interval if both countries are to benefit
from trade. This interval is given by the cost ratios in both countries. If it falls in between those, the

ùëùùê∂ ùëôùê∂ùê∏ (1 + ùëüùê∂ùê∏ ) ùëôùê∂ùê∏ ùëùùê∂ùê∏

Indeed, for those terms of trade English capitalists will prefer to produce and export cloth. Remember that competition
will force the rate of profit to be ùëü ùê∏ . What we have proved is that if cloth production observes the normal rate of profit,
then linen production will not be able to.
                                                                                                                    9

     ùêø     ùëùùêø       ùêø
        What‚Äôs important to notice is that the cost ratios of both countries only define the region where
trade is profitable. They do not necessarily guarantee that trade will be profitable. For that it is
required that we know the terms of trade. However, when trade does occur, it has to be with the
country producing and exporting the commodity in which it has a comparative advantage.

     4. James Mill‚Äôs Error
        The first two editions of James Mill‚Äôs Elements (1821; 1824) contained a mistake in the
treatment of international trade. It was present in an example in which England and Germany
exchanged cloth and linen.11 The error was finally identified and revised in the third edition
(1844[1826]). However, a fundamental question was left open. The determination of the terms of
trade was missing. The second edition introduced our example with England and Germany
exchanging cloth and linen, which we shall use throughout. The first step is to understand how he
first committed the error. Afterwards we can translate it into our model.
        Let‚Äôs start by analysing the paragraph where James Mill establishes the example. It was first
introduced in the second edition of his book and kept, albeit with modifications, in the third. A full
quotation might be in place:

           If 10 yards of broad cloth in England can purchase 15 yards of linen, which means that they
           have cost an equal quantity of labour; while in Germany 10 yards of broad cloth can purchase
           20 yards of linen; it is very evidently the interest of England to send broad cloth to purchase
           linen in Germany, because with 10 yards of broad cloth, that is, as much cost of production
           as would produce 15 yards of linen, she can obtain 20 yards.
           It is equally the interest of Germany to send linen to purchase broad cloth in England, because
           with 15 yards of linen she can purchase 10 yards of broad cloth in England, which, if made at
           home, would cost her as much as 20 yards of linen. (Mill, 1824, p. 118-9)

           What is he saying in this paragraph? He starts by establishing the cost ratios in both countries.
                                                                           ùëùùê∏
In England, the cost ratio of producing cloth in terms of linen is ùëùùê∂ùê∏ = 1.5. In Germany the same cost
                                                                            ùêø
                         ùê∫
                        ùëùùê∂
ratio would be                = 2. This implies that England has a comparative advantage in producing cloth
                        ùëùùêøùê∫
while Germany in producing linen (1.5 < 2). In this case, as we have seen, there can only be mutually
beneficial trade if England exports cloth and Germany linen. The interval where the terms of trade
                   ùëù
could lie is 1.5 ‚â§ ùê∂ ‚â§ 2. Nothing has been said about the terms of trade, though. Now trade is a mere
                          ùëùùêø
possibility.
        In order to argue how England would benefit from trade he says that: ‚Äúit is very evidently the
interest of England to send broad cloth to purchase linen in Germany, because with 10 yards of broad
cloth (‚Ä¶) she can obtain 20 yards [of linen]‚Äù (ibid.). This implies that England faces an international
price of cloth in terms of linen equal to 2, every unit of cloth exported is able to secure two units of
linen. The terms of trade will then be equivalent to Germany‚Äôs cost ratio.
        This would be an extreme case where only one country would benefit from trade. However,
there are no mistakes so far. As Sraffa (1930, p. 539-40) notes in the England-Poland example (see
footnote 11 above): ‚ÄúTo take, as James Mill does, the extreme case in which the ratio of interchange
is such that the whole gain is reaped by one of the two trading countries to the exclusion of the other,


 All three editions of James Mill‚Äôs book start with an example in which England and Poland exchange cloth and corn.
11

However, since it deals with a basic commodity (corn) it has additional complications regarding distribution that we
would like to avoid here. The analytical error was the same in both examples. That‚Äôs why we will focus on the England-
Germany one.
                                                                                                                       10

and use it to illustrate the general theory of foreign trade, is highly misleading; but in itself it does not
involve a contradiction‚Äù. By construction, only England is benefitting from trade.
         The mistake was in the next part of the argument. Mill argued that ‚ÄúIt is equally the interest
of Germany to send linen to purchase broad cloth in England‚Äù, which we know is non sensical. But
where does the error lie? According to him, from Germany‚Äôs point of view: ‚Äúwith 15 yards of linen
she can purchase 10 yards of broad cloth in England‚Äù. So, Germany is importing cloth with her linen
in a ratio of 1.5/1. This is exactly England‚Äôs cost ratio. For this terms of trade England could not take
any benefit from trade.
         The problem is that England is exchanging cloth into linen in the international market at a rate
different from which Germany is exchanging linen into cloth. This is truly a ‚Äúnon-sequitur‚Äù. After
all, as soon as England trades its cloth for Germany‚Äôs linen it is implied that Germany is doing the
reciprocal operation simultaneously. Between the second and the third edition the error was spotted
and the text edited. Mill added that: ‚Äúit is the inevitable effect of such an interchange to bring the
relative value of the two commodities to a level in the two countries‚Äù (Mill, 1844[1826], p. 55).
         Mill is unable to specify where the terms of trade would lie, though. The level to which
international values will inevitable be brought to is nowhere to be found in his work. This
incompleteness has a few implications according to the framework we have drawn above. First, it is
not possible to verify the benefits each country can gain from trade, or the direction of specialization.
After all, a country needs to compare its cost ratio with the ruling international value in order to do
that. Besides this, it is impossible to ascertain that trade will be mutually beneficial. Nothing
guarantees that international values will fall inside the interval between both countries‚Äô cost ratios.
Stuart Mill understands what the problem was and the remaining theoretical gap.12 His contribution
aims at completing his father construct.

    5. Stuart Mill‚Äôs closure
         Enough ground has been covered to allow us to deal with Stuart Mill. We will focus our
attention in his international trade argument as present in the Principles (Mill, 1968[1871]). His other
main contribution was in the first essay of Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy
(1844). The later book contains long quotations from the previous work and an argument almost
intact, which implies that the analytical argument is unchanged. An important point that changed
between both expositions is that in the later Stuart Mill makes no claim that Ricardo was either wrong
or incomplete. The earlier work is explicit: ‚ÄúMr. Ricardo (‚Ä¶) unguardedly expressed himself as if
each of the two countries making the exchange separately gained the whole of the difference between
the comparative costs of the two commodities in one country and in the other.‚Äù (Mill, 1844, p. 5-6).
         Stuart Mill starts his chapter Of International Trade (Mill, 1968[1871], book 3, chap. 17) by
arguing that ‚Äúcost of production is not the regulator of international values‚Äù (p. 587). This is a clear
reference to Ricardo‚Äôs remark that ‚ÄúThe same rule which regulates the relative value of commodities
in one country, does not regulate the relative value of the commodities exchanged between two or
more countries‚Äù (Works, vol. 1, p. 113). Stuart Mill uses his father‚Äôs England-Germany example to
illustrate the point. England has a comparative advantage in producing cloth and Germany in linen.
The terms of trade will not be equal to either one‚Äôs cost ratio, though. This is a necessary condition
for both of them to benefit from trade, as we have seen in section two above.



12
   Other authors have argued that James Mill‚Äôs Elements was, in great measure, written by his son. They claim that the
error was introduced by Stuart Mill rather than by James Mill, for example Thweatt (1987). Though intended as a defense
of James Mill, Thweatt‚Äôs claims are a bit flimsy. For it would imply that James Mill not only let his book contain an
evident error for two editions, but also had a lack of understanding of Ricardo‚Äôs theory. After all, when the error was
corrected in the third edition it was wanting as compared to Ricardo (Thweatt more or less agrees with Sraffa‚Äôs
interpretation of it).
However, we are not concerned with those details. Our aim is to clarify analytical points. The objective data we are faced
is: the error present in two editions of James Mill‚Äôs book; an insufficient correction in the third edition; and two
contributions by Stuart Mill where he proposes a solution.
                                                                                                        11

        However, it is erroneous to say that international values do not conform to the cost of
productions in Ricardo. His allusion to a different rule that regulates relative value seems to imply
that commodities do not exchange according to their embodied labours in the international market.
This contrasts to the case of commodities produced nearby, whose relative prices tend to be equal to
the relative amount of labour spent in their production. We have seen that this comes because of
capital not being mobile across countries.
        Despite this, terms of trade will necessarily be equal to the ratio of cost of production across
exporting countries. Otherwise one might be puzzled when a few chapters later Ricardo says that ‚Äúit
is the natural price of commodities in the exporting country, which ultimately regulates the prices at
which they shall be sold (‚Ä¶) in the importing country‚Äù (Works, vol. 1, p. 238). How can both
propositions be true? The answer can be found in Stuart Mill‚Äôs book itself, which makes his confusion
even more striking.
        In book three, chapters three and four of his Principles Stuart Mill discusses the relationship
between cost of production and value. As usual, for reproducible commodities, the general case is
that value conforms to the relative amount of labour. However, in paragraphs three and four of chapter
four, he admits that when profit and wages are permanently different in the production of two
commodities, their relative price is not equal to the ratio of embodied labour. He summarizes this by
saying that ‚ÄúProfits, therefore, as well as wages, enter into the cost of production which determines
the value of the produce‚Äù (Mill, 1968[1871], p. 482).
        This is exactly what he assumes to happen with international trade: ‚Äúbetween different
countries (‚Ä¶) there may exist great inequalities in the return to labour and capital, without causing
them to move from one place to the other‚Äù (idem, p. 588). The England-Germany example, when
England is exporting cloth and Germany linen can be used to explain this. In that case, English cloth
would have to be able to pay the same wage and profit as the non-tradable good (good 1). Its price as
a function of the price of the wage good was shown to be (equation ( 6 ) above): ùëùùê∂ùê∏ = ùëù1ùê∏ (ùëôùê∂ùê∏ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∏ ). In
a similar manner the price of linen in Germany had to be (equation ( 9 )): ùëùùêøùê∫ = ùëù1ùê∫ (ùëôùêøùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∫ ). Those are
the natural prices that must be respected in the exporting country. So, in one way or another the terms
of trade will have to be equivalent to:
 ùëùùê∂ ùëù1ùê∏ (ùëôùê∂ùê∏ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∏ )
     =                                                                                         ( 10 )
  ùëùùêø ùëù1ùê∫ (ùëôùêøùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∫ )

         Of course, this implies a common measure for the price level in both countries. This is not
enough to determine the terms of trade, though, simply because we do not know what is the monetary
price of the wage good (ùëù1ùê∏ and ùëù1ùê∫ ) in either country. It is just a condition that must hold if each
country individually is to have a uniform rate of profit in its sectors, including in non-tradables. It is
enough to show that, contrary to Stuart Mill‚Äôs conclusion, ‚Äúpermanent value is proportioned to cost
of production‚Äù even ‚Äúbetween commodities produced in distant places‚Äù (Mill, 1968[1871], p. 587).
It is not proportional to labour embodied though.
         How are terms of trade determined then? Or in Stuart Mill‚Äôs words: ‚Äúwhat are the causes
which determine the proportion in which the cloth of England and the linen of Germany will exchange
for each other‚Äù (idem, p. 597)? To answer this question, he introduces two concepts. The first one we
are already familiar with. The second one is particular to his construct, but not without precedent.
They are:
     ‚Ä¢ Balanced trade is the only stable situation;
     ‚Ä¢ Each countries‚Äô demand for imports is inversely proportional to the relative price of its
         imports.

       The first assumption is justified by recurring to ‚Äúall trade is in reality barter (‚Ä¶) an actual
trucking of one commodity against another‚Äù (idem, p. 595). If trade is barter then the exports and
imports in value terms must match every time. After all, for every commodity imported there is a
correspondent commodity exported, no matter what. Stuart Mill does relax this hypothesis further on
                                                                                                                     12

by introducing money. He does not, however, change his conclusions.13 So, we can proceed as if in a
barter system and avoid the complications introduced by money.
        Let ùê∑ùêøùê∏ and ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫ be England‚Äôs demand for linen and Germany‚Äôs demand for cloth, respectively.
Those shall be supplied through importation. Balanced trade requires that exports and imports are
equal in value terms. It can be presented as ùëùùêø ùê∑ùêøùê∏ = ùëùùê∂ ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫ . Where, from England‚Äôs point of view, the
left-hand side is the imports and the right-hand side the exports. This condition can be manipulated
to show explicitly the relationship that must hold between terms of trade and reciprocal demands:
 ùëùùê∂ ùê∑ùêøùê∏
     =                                                                                     ( 11 )
 ùëùùêø ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫

         The second assumption is something new in classical political economy. He introduces that
the quantity demanded of given good is negatively related to its relative price: ‚ÄúThe demand for a
commodity, that is, the quantity of it which can find a purchaser, varies as we have before remarked,
according to the price‚Äù (idem, p. 597).
         In fact, he starts his analysis of value with the law of supply and demand (idem, book 3,
chapter 2). In there, he separates commodities into three classes with different laws of values. The
first class are commodities whose supply is fixed, like paintings from great masters. Their value
would be ruled by the law of supply and demand. The second class are commodities that could be
reproduced virtually indefinitely. Those would have their value determined by cost of production.
The last, intermediate, class of commodities are those that can be increased in quantity only with a
higher cost.
         Commodities brought from different countries fall into the second class. They could in
principle be ‚Äúincreased or diminished to a great, and even an unlimited extent‚Äù (idem, p. 469).
Nevertheless, their ‚Äúvalue never depends upon anything but demand and supply‚Äù (ibid.).14 From there,
Stuart Mill establishes that each country‚Äôs demand for imports are a function of the terms of trade:
            ùëùùêø
 ùê∑ùêøùê∏ = ùëì ( )
            ùëùùê∂
            ùëùùê∂                                                                            ( 12 )
 ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫ = ùëî ( )
            ùëùùêø

       The specific format of the curves is not given. Instead he says that they ‚Äúcannot be reduced to
any rule‚Äù (idem, p. 599). The shape becomes a matter of statistical determination, at best. The only
general rule they shall follow is to be negatively related to the commodity‚Äôs relative price.15
       With equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) it is very easy to find the equilibrium term of trade. It will
simply be the one that is equal to the ratio between the two demand functions. This one will be just
enough to allow for balanced trade, determining price and quantity.
          ùëùùêø
 ùëùùê∂ ùëì (ùëùùê∂ )
    =                                                                                      ( 13 )
 ùëùùêø ùëî (ùëùùê∂ )
          ùëùùêø


13
   The introduction of money does not change the characterization of balanced trade as the resting position: ‚Äúwhether
money is employed or not, things are only in their permanent state when the exports and imports exactly pay for each
other‚Äù (idem, p. 630). What change is the mechanism through which equilibrium is restored. With barter there can only
be equilibrium. With money, however, disequilibrium can occur. The difference of export and imports will be offset by
flows of ‚Äúgold‚Äù from the deficit country to the surplus country. Through the quantity theory of money, this will enforce
the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù price level in each country.
14
   Stuart Mill says the same about labour. He is thus bringing supply and demand into the theory of distribution. Hence
into the determination of every commodity‚Äôs value, since they all use labour in their production. This has further
implications for the transition between classical and marginal economics (see Bharadwaj, 1989).
15
   A caveat is in place. We do not wish to claim that those demand functions are based on marginalist concepts. As a
matter of fact, they seem to lack a solid theoretical foundation and resort to common sense. However, it opens the
possibility for later authors to explain it in terms of ‚Äúmarginal utility‚Äù theory of demand.
                                                                                                                               13

              The solution for this equation is the equilibrium term of trade ( ùê∂ ) . Stuart Mil summarizes
                                                                                           ùëùùêø
it well in the following passage:

              when two countries trade together in two commodities, the exchange value of these
              commodities relatively to each other will adjust itself to the inclinations and circumstances of
              the consumers on both sides, in such manner that the quantities required by each country, of
              the articles which it imports from its neighbour, shall be exactly sufficient to pay for one
              another (idem, p. 598-9)

         Again, there is no reason for this to fall into the region where both countries benefit from
trade. In other words, it could be lower or higher than both cost ratios. In this case, trade would not
be profitable for both countries. We will assume that it does fall inside the interval defined by the cost
ratios. Inside it, it can assume any value.
         In equation ( 10 ) we have established the relationship between terms of trade and price level
that must happen for specialization to occur according to comparative costs. So, in the end, Stuart
Mill is also determining the proportion between price levels that has to prevail for this:
  ùëù1ùê∏     ùëùùê∂ ‚àó (ùëôùêøùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∫ )
      = (    )                                                                                ( 14 )
  ùëù1ùê∫     ùëùùêø (ùëôùê∂ùê∏ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∏ )

        When this happens, comparative advantage will also imply a lower monetary cost in the
exporting country. By this we mean that, if the ratio of price levels adjust to the equilibrium terms of
trade as in ( 14 ), the monetary price of English cloth will be lower than the monetary cost that Portugal
would have to incur to produce itself. The same is valid for Portuguese wine. These two facts can be
represented by:16
ùëùùê∂ùê∏ < ùëùùê∂ùê∫
ùëùùêøùê∫ < ùëùùêøùê∏

       Evidently this has to hold, at least in the long-run resting position. After all, for products of
the same quality and characteristics, consumers do not care where they come from. If German cloth
is cheaper than the English one in a common standard, consumers will buy it. They do not care that
England has a comparative advantage in cloth. This explains the seemingly conflicting quote from


16
   We will prove it for the case of English cloth, but the same kind of reasoning could be used for the German linen.
Remember that we have established (in equations ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) above) the prices of cloth that would have to be observed
in England and in Germany as a function of the corresponding wage good price. Those would allow for a normal profit
rate in this sector. They were, respectively: ùëùùê∂ùê∏ = ùëù1ùê∏ (ùëôùê∂ùê∏ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∏ ) and ùëùùê∂ùê∫ = ùëù1ùê∫ (ùëôùê∂ùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∫ ). Divide one for the other to get:
ùëùùê∂ùê∏ ùëù1ùê∏ (ùëôùê∂ùê∏ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∏ )
    =
ùëùùê∂ùê∫ ùëù1ùê∫ (ùëôùê∂ùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∫ )

                             ùëù1ùê∏      ùëù     ‚àó (ùëôùêøùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëô1ùê∫ )
Using the fact that                = ( ùê∂)       ùê∏ ‚ÅÑùëôùê∏ )     and after some manipulation:
                             ùëù1ùê∫      ùëùùêø      (ùëôùê∂   1
ùëùùê∂ùê∏     ùëùùê∂        ‚àó    ùëôùêøùê∫
      =( )            ( ùê∫)
ùëùùê∂ùê∫     ùëùùêø             ùëôùê∂

However, by equation ( 8 ) above, the second term on the right is just Germany‚Äôs cost ratio (=ùëùùêøùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëùùê∂ùê∫ ). So, we can rewrite
it as:
ùëùùê∂ùê∏ (ùëùùê∂ ‚ÅÑùëùùêø )‚àó
    =
ùëùùê∂ùê∫ (ùëùùê∂ùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëùùêøùê∫ )

                                                                                                (ùëùùê∂ ‚ÅÑùëùùêø )‚àó
We have assumed that trade is profitable for both countries, then (ùëùùê∂ ‚ÅÑùëùùêø )‚àó < ùëùùê∂ùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëùùêøùê∫ ‚áí         ùê∫ ‚ÅÑùëù ùê∫ )   < 1. This proves that

Ricardo above where the price in the importing country is equal to the natural price in the exporting
country.
        This result explains Stuart Mill‚Äôs remark that ‚Äúthere are many things which, though they could
be produced at home without difficulty, and in any quantity, are yet imported from a distance. The
explanation which would be popularly given of this would be, that it is cheaper to import than to
produce them: and this is the true reason. But this reason itself requires that a reason be given for it.‚Äù
(idem, p. 587). At any one point the exporting country is that which can offer the good for the lowest
monetary price. However, for Stuart Mill there are forces that compel the country with a comparative
advantage to be the one with lowest monetary costs. This is the reason behind the reason Stuart Mill
alluded to. The country‚Äôs monetary prices will be defined by the ratio of reciprocal demands as in the
solution to equation ( 13 ). This guarantees that the country with the competitive advantage will have
the lowest monetary price for its exporting good.
        So, through the introduction of functions of reciprocal demands, Stuart Mill is able to
determine the terms of trade. This allows him to close the theoretical gap his father had left open.
However, to do so he gives a twist to classical thought by introducing foreign concepts.

    6. Conclusion
        In this paper we have set the task to clarify two interrelated points in the history of economic
thought. The first one was how James Mill committed an analytical error in his exposition of the
theory of trade. As we have seen, he sets his model with England and Germany trading cloth and
linen. He proceeds as if each country faces different ratios of international prices. England would
trade its cloth for Polish linen at a rate different from which Poland would do the reverse. This is
clearly unattainable. The error persisted for two editions of his book, being eventually corrected in
the third edition. The correction was not fully satisfactory though, leaving the terms of trade
undefined.
        His son, Stuart Mill, started from this theoretical gap to present his contribution. He believed
that the error was somewhat fundamental, attributing it also to Ricardo. He thought it was justified to
bring into the picture foreign concepts. He introduces the law of supply and demand as a
determination of values (not only in the international scheme). This is not without consequences. Our
second goal was to clarify how he uses it to determine international values.
        Through explicitly introducing a non-tradable wage good in the model, we have been able to
derive some properties the countries must show to export the commodities in which they have a
competitive advantage. This helped to dispel some apparent puzzles regarding Ricardo‚Äôs affirmation
of different laws of value for domestic and international goods. If trade happens, competition forces
monetary costs in the exporting country to be bounded by international values. So, while being true
that the terms of trade are not determined by either country‚Äôs cost ratio, they have to converge in some
way or another. Otherwise, the country with the competitive advantage might not be the one with
lowest monetary costs.
        By examining James Mill and Stuart Mill, we wish to contribute to the renewed interest in
classical trade theory. The new Sraffa-Ruffin interpretation sets Ricardo free from incompleteness
and error. It puts itself in a clash with the standard/Stuart Mill‚Äôs interpretation. We have employed
the modern tools Sraffa gave us to understand classical economists to study how this standard
interpretation was built. It not only gives us a clearer view of the differences brought by the Sraffa-
Ruffin literature as it also gives us some insight into the history of economic thought. From Ricardo
to the ‚ÄúRicardian model‚Äù there is a story of misunderstandings, errors, and shifts in different
directions.
