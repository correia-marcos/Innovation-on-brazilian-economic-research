Abstract: This paper assesses the consequences of domestic outsourcing on different groups of workers,
stemming from a theoretical model with heterogeneous individuals and firms. We find the wage gap
between outsourced workers and non-outsourced ones to be larger for more productive workers, as well
as for those who work at sectors where observation of their effort is harder. Furthermore, using Brazilian
micro-data and quantile regressions, we demonstrate that the effect of outsourcing on wages grows with
income, as suggested by the theoretical model.

Resumo: Este artigo avalia as consequências da terceirização doméstica sobre diferentes grupos de
trabalhadores a partir de um modelo teórico com indivíduos e firmas heterogêneos. Nossa análise teórica
indica que o gap salarial para trabalhadores terceirizados deve ser maior para os trabalhadores mais
produtivos, assim como para aqueles indivíduos que trabalham em setores em que é mais difícil observar
o seu esforço. Além disso, usando microdados brasileiros, nós evidenciamos por meio de um arcabouço
de regressão quantílica que os efeitos da terceirização sobre os salários tornam-se mais relevantes para os
indivíduos com maior salário, o que corrobora as conclusões do nosso modelo teórico.

1. Introduction
        Over the last two decades, the economic impacts of service outsourcing have generated ever-
increasing academic interest (MANKIW and SWAGEL, 2006). Amid these studies (carefully reviewed in
the next section), some seek to estimate outsourcing’s effects on wages, and overall conclude that
outsourced workers earn less than their non-outsourced counterparts.
        Williamson (2008) suggests the outsourcing processes can be adopted under very distinct
circumstances and with equally distinguished objectives. Thus, workers from different sectors and levels
of human capital could be outsourced.
        In this paper, we focus on domestic outsourcing – witch contrasts with offshoring
(GOLDSHIMIDT and SCHMIEDER, 2017). We evaluate whether the effects of outsourcing on workers’
wages are homogeneous or not. We therefore intend to build a highly stylized model that underlines how
disparities in the labor outsourcing sector and in the outsourced workers’ productivity can influence the
observed wage gap.
        Moreover, an empirical analysis will be carried in order to test the conclusions of this theoretical
model. Data from the Annual Social Information Report (RAIS) for 2014 will be used, and so will a
methodology of quantile regression, to explore heterogeneous effects of outsourcing on wages.
        This article consists of five sections, in addition to this introduction. Section 2 reviews literature
concerning outsourcing in relation to wages. Section 3 develops the theoretical model. Section 4 discusses
the database employed, as well as presents the empirical model and its results. Section 5 tests the
adjustment of the model when we control for selection of outsourced workers.


2. The impact of outsourcing on wages

        As pointed out in the introduction, this paper focuses on domestic outsourcing processes and their
implications on the wages of the workers who have been outsourced. Berlinski (2008) is the first paper
with similar purpose. He assess the consequences of outsourcing for low human capital workers in the
United Kingdom.
        The author builds a database for workers from 1995 to 2001 and conducts estimates of a
Mincerian equation, which includes a dummy variable for outsourced workers, through Generalized Least
Squares (GLS) and propensity score matching, and concludes that the evaluated workers are paid 17% to
19% less than non-outsourced similar employees. His outsourcing definition is somewhat limited, since
his database has fewer than sixty outsourced workers.
        Dube and Kaplan (2010) also perform an empirical work to analyze the effect of outsourcing on
low-human capital workers, more specifically guards and janitors, in the U.S. An outsourcing indicating
variable, similar to the one used in this study, is created by the combination of information on the job
performed by each worker and the sector in which they work, using micro-data from the Current
Population Survey (CPS), between 1983 and 2000.
        The authors construct a Mincerian equation and estimate it via the Generalized Least Squares
(GLS) method. In this first estimation, it is shown that outsourced janitors make about 5% less, while
guards earn about 20% less, when compared to non-outsourced workers in the same occupation.
        Dube and Kaplan (2010) then examine if unobservable differences in productivity may explain the
wage gap. They build a two-period panel and individuals with the same occupation are observed on each
of the periods. Subsequently, a new wage equation is estimated through the first difference method. The
outsourcing wage penalties still remain though, around 7% for janitors and 12% for guards. This
methodology was, then, used in all subsequent papers on the topic.
        Thereby, the authors find outsourced workers are paid less due to their contract type. They also
conclude that the penalty suffered by the workers is not explained by low rent pass-through or
compensating differentials, so it must be associated with some non-taken rent, like the one obtained
through unionization, for instance; since the persistent estimated difference is not compatible with the
hypothesis of a competitive market. Despite these considerations, Dube and Kaplan (2010) do not go
further in the outsourcing wage penalty theory.
        Stein, Zylberstajn e Zylberstajn (2016) apply the previous methodology to Brazilian data. The
authors consider outsourced workers in the cleaning, security, technology of information (TI),
maintenance and research and development (R&D). The author show that almost all the raw outsourced
wage gap in their sample can be explained by different individual characteristics. Once they control for
variant observable and fixed unobservable characteristics through the first-difference method, they
conclude that the average wage gap is about only 3%.
        They do not systematically analyze how the wage gap varies with different characteristics of the
workers, but, by estimating separate regressions for each sector, they point out that the gap tends to be
higher for low-skilled workers.
         Belchior and Bertussi (2016) also utilize a Brazilian data, similar to the one in this paper, and
used the detailed available classifications on occupations and sectors in order to create broad
classification for outsourced workers1. A Mincerian equation is estimated, in order to conclude that
outsourced workers earn 7.2% to 10.5% less than non-outsourced ones. Furthermore, the authors examine
if unobservable fixed effects bias the estimate, in a similar manner as Dube and Kaplan (2010); then,
through a first difference model in panel data, come to the conclusion that a fixed bias does not
significantly alter the previous estimation. An extensive analysis is carried, looking to identify average
effects of outsourcing.
        The authors argue that these wage disparities are motivated by differences in efficiency wage
payments for outsourced and non-outsourced workers. This suggestion provides an explanation for the
difference in rents uncovered by Dube and Kaplan (2010).
        Goldshimidt e Schmieder (2017) also employed the previous methodology and estimated average
impacts of outsourcing on German workers of logistics, food, security and cleaning (LFSC) sectors. They
found that analyzed outsourced workers suffered a 9% wage penalty. These results are broadly consistent
with previous estimates.
        Despite that, they argue that it is difficult to account for different job characteristics of outsourced
workers. The authors suggest using on-site outsourcing events as an identification strategy. They identify
several aggregate flows of workers from final to intermediate firms in the LFSC’s sectors. It is argued
that these outsourced workers were likely to perform the same activities as they were previously doing.
        Their estimates show that the workers who passed through such an event received between 10%
and 15% less than similar workers who were not outsourced, ten years of the outsourcing event.
Goldshimidt e Schmieder (2017) also employ the decomposition methodology employed by Card,
Heining e Kline (2013) and conclude that differences in firm’s rents explained all the declining relative
wages of outsourced workers.
        So, the previous studies consistently estimated negative average impacts of outsourcing on
workers’ wages and associated then with differences in non-competitive rents captured by those workers,
relying mostly on fixed-effect estimates. These conclusions are congruent with recent empirical findings,
derived from the works of Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999), Card, Heining and Kline (2013) and
Song et al. (2016).
        Song et al. (2016), in particular, decomposed the variance of income and concluded that the most
important fraction in the increased country inequality (more than two-thirds) is attributed to the increased
inequality between firms, and not between workers in the same firm. Further yet, they show this process
is mostly due to a larger segregation of workers in different companies.
        They suggest outsourcing may be a relevant factor in explaining this process. However, they claim
that simply dividing workers into more and less productive would not alter income distribution if they
were paid in equivalence to their marginal productivity in both cases. In these terms, the uncovered
difference in rents by difference outsource workers may help explaining these patterns in wage inequality.
        This paper further explores the previous insights in mainly two dimensions. First, we develop a
concrete theoretical explanation for the difference in rents appropriated by workers. Second, we
systematically explore how outsourcing effects varies both theoretically and empirically for different
workers.

  The work considers as outsourcing any type of service related to production and transferred to a third party. Thus, the
database includes workers on different levels of human capital. For example, it considers consulting as a type of outsourcing.
       3. Theoretical model

      In this section, first Belchior and Bertussi (2016)’s model will be replicated, and then it will be
expanded in order to incorporate more than one individual, as well as different sectors.

3.1 Base model
         The economy under consideration has n identical workers whose preferences are represented by
the utility function:
                                                    𝑢 =𝑤−𝜀                                              (1)


where 𝑤 is the wage perceived by the workers and 𝜀 indicates their level of effort. We will assume that
the worker can perform on two levels of effort – high and low. The variable 𝜀 will assume value 1 if the
worker performs on high effort, and value 0 if they perform on low effort.
       Workers receive unemployment insurance of value 𝑤      ̅ if they are not working, which acts as a
reservation wage. Their effort is not perfectly observable. In case the effort is not being made, the
employer observes this behavior with a probability of 𝑝. If the workers are caught shirking, they are fired.
       The benefits are evaluated by the workers according to the expected utility theory. If they perform
with high effort, 𝜀 assumes value 1, so they will not be submitted to uncertainty and their utility will be:
                                                    𝑢𝑒 = 𝑤 − 1                                          (2)


Conversely, if they show low effort their utility will be:
                                         𝑢𝑛 = 𝑤 ∗ 𝑝 + (1 − 𝑝) ∗ 𝑤                                       (3)


       This way, it can be assured that the workers will exert effort if, and only if:
                                                             1                                          (4)
                                                    𝑤 ≥𝑤+
                                                             𝑝


       We shall assume the economy contains only one final good, produced by m identical firms
operating under perfect competition and with the objective function given by:
                               𝜋 = (1 + 𝛿𝜀) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛) − (𝐶 + 𝑤) ∗ 𝑛,        𝛿>0                            (5)


where 𝑆(𝑛) is a strictly concave revenue function for the firms, 𝑛 is the amount of workers hired and 𝐶
represents costs associated to labor management (social charges, labor management costs, etc). It can be
noted that when the workers make an effort (so that 𝜀 assumes a value of 1) the firms’ revenue function is
moved up by a positive factor (1 + 𝛿), where 𝛿 is the increment factor of the revenue curve by effort.
       It helps to define the derivative of the inverse revenue function as:
                                               𝑆 ′ (𝑛)−1 = 𝜑(𝑛)                                         (6)


        One can easily understand that firms can maximize their profits in distinct states of nature, paying
the efficiency wage or not. A firm may determine:
                                       max 𝜋 = 𝑆(𝑛) − (𝐶 + 𝑤) ∗ 𝑛                                       (7)
                                         𝑛

                                             𝑠. 𝑎              ̅
                                                             𝑤≥𝑤
in such a way as to not encourage workers to make an effort. In this case, we have:
                                                                  ̅)
                                                        𝑛 = 𝜑(𝐶 + 𝑤                                              (8)


       When the firm pays high enough salaries to induce workers to exert effort (so that 𝜀 assumes the
value of 1), it will determine:
                                       max
                                        𝑒
                                           𝜋 𝑒 = (1 + 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛𝑒 ) − (𝐶 + 𝑤) ∗ 𝑛𝑒
                                        𝑛
                                                                                                                 (9)
                                                                                1
                                               𝑠. 𝑎                    ̅+
                                                                     𝑤≥𝑤

           Optimally, we have:
                                                                1
                                                             ̅ +𝑝

                                                   𝑛𝑒 = 𝜑 (       )                                              (10)
                                                            1+𝛿



If the shift in productivity is big enough, it will compensate the increase in wage costs, and firms will opt
for paying the efficiency wage.
        Now, an additional firm2 that provides outsourced labor to the firms producing the final good is
introduced. It is assumed to be more efficient than others in executing labor management, without
incurring cost 𝐶. Additionally, said cost is supposed to be reduced to zero, in order to facilitate further
mathematical development on the model.
        The outsourcing firm pays a high enough wage to attract the workforce, and then passes it on to
the other companies for a value 𝑤 𝑜 , in a similar outsourced labor supply model to the one proposed by
Holmes e Snider (2011). It will receive unitary profit:
                                                         𝑤𝑜 − 𝑤 > 0                                              (11)


        An important point is that labor outsourcing firms have no incentive for paying the efficiency
wage, since they cannot benefit directly from the increase in labor productivity, and it raises costs.
        Now, firms can maximize their profit in three different states of nature, including the one where
they hire outsourced labor:
                                                 max
                                                  𝑡
                                                     𝜋 = 𝑆(𝑛𝑡 ) − 𝑤 𝑜 ∗ 𝑛𝑡                                       (12)
                                                   𝑛



which gives us, optimally,
                                                         𝑛𝑡 = 𝜑(𝑤 𝑜 )                                            (13)


        As with the efficiency wage case, the referred paper denotes that, for a sufficiently large cost
reduction, the contracting of outsourced labor increases the profitability of firms. It also reduces the wage
and productivity of workers, since they are not encouraged to deliver a high level of effort through the
efficiency wage payment.

    The hypothesis that outsourcing firms operate as a monopoly is consistent with the work of Baccara (2007).
3.2 Various sectors
         In this subsection, we will keep the hypothesis that workers are identical and that there is only one
final good in the economy. It shall be assumed, however, that some firms have introduced exogenously a
new supervision method, which makes it easier to observe the workers’ effort3. This framework is hoped
to mimic different grades of observation on the effort of workers from various sectors of an economy.
         Supposing a fraction of the existing firms is able to observe the workers’ effort with a probability
of 𝑝̅, so that:
                                                           𝑝̅ > 𝑝                                                        (14)


        The problem for these firms when they induce workers to exert effort is:
                                     max 𝜋̅ 𝑒 = (1 + 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛̅𝑒 ) − (𝐶 + 𝑤) ∗ 𝑛̅𝑒
                                       𝑛
                                                                                                                         (15)
                                                                               1
                                             𝑠. 𝑎                     ̅+
                                                                    𝑤≥𝑤
                                                                               𝑝̅

       One can notice that, since it is easier for the employer to observe the worker’s effort, the threat of
resignation in case they do not make an effort becomes more believable. Therefore, the wage required to
induce effort is lower than in the previous case.
       Optimal contracting for this firm will imply:
                                                                            1
                                                          1             ̅ + 𝑝̅
                                                                      𝐶+𝑤
                                                       ̅ + ⇨ 𝑛̅𝑒 = 𝜑 (
                            (1 + 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆 ′ (𝑛̅𝑒 ) = 𝐶 + 𝑤                       )                                         (16)
                                                          𝑝̅           1+𝛿



        In this case, the efficiency wage paid is lower and the impacts on productivity are the same, so we
can conclude that these new firms are raising their profits more than the rest. Besides, it being shown to
be profitable to apply efficiency wage for firms with more difficulty to observe effort, under the same
assumptions it is also assuredly worth it for new firms to encourage workers’ effort.
        We now introduce again the possibility that the firm outsources labor. Noticeably, the firm’s
optimization when utilizing outsourced labor does not depend on how easily it can observe its workers’
effort. Thus, the optimization performed by the firm and the optimal contracting of workers will be the
same as those described in equations (12) and (13).

        For a small enough 𝑤 𝑜 , it is possible that:

which ensures that profits from both types of firm will be greater in case they outsource labor. The
addition of one more type of firm does not change the model’s key characteristic, that outsourced workers
do not receive efficiency wages.
        The wage gap between outsourced and non-outsourced workers is defined as:
                                                       𝐺 = 𝑤 − 𝑤𝑡                                                        (18)

  Since they operate in a competitive market, an explicit short-term analysis will be conducted. This will make it possible for
two companies with different production methods and cost functions to coexist in the market.

        As for the ones with the new supervision method, the wage gap is given by:

        From that, given the restriction imposed by equation (14), we can guarantee that:

       From this framework, one can observe a negative relationship between the increase in probability
of detecting lack of effort in a sector and the wage gap in that same sector.

3.3 Various individuals
        In this subsection, we go back to envisioning only one type of firm in the economy. Additionally,
one more type of worker is brought in to the analysis. We shall now assume there is a fraction of high-
skilled workers in this economy. These workers, as well as the low-skilled ones, can execute a high or
low level of effort. Nevertheless, they will be assumed to be more productive and to bring a higher return
rate for the firm from their effort. This will be inserted in the model, and 𝜀 will now assume values 1 and
2.
        Such modeling allows productivity disparities of workers to be added to the model. Note that the
individual incurs costs (in this case, higher effort) to increase their productivity, in a similar way to
investment in human capital by individuals4.
        The firm is assumed to be capable of distinguishing high-skilled from low-skilled workers (those
able to execute higher effort and be more productive, and those less able to do that). Nonetheless, it still
cannot perfectly observe the level of effort achieved by individuals. So, it will observe with a probability
of p whether a high-skilled individual is showing low effort (so that 𝜀 = 1) and dismiss them if that is the
case.
        When high-skilled individuals do not make an effort, their well-being is given by:
                                         𝑢𝑞𝑛 = 𝑤 ∗ 𝑝 + (1 − 𝑝) ∗ (𝑤𝑞 − 1)                                             (22)

  Despite the resemblance, we opted for not making the decision of investment in human capital endogenous, in order to keep
the simplicity of the model.
       Evidently, the required wage for high-skilled workers to exert effort is higher than the one
required for the low-skilled, as stated in equation (4). This fits the empirical observation that high-skilled
workers have a higher reservation wage (KRUEGER and MUELLER, 2016).
       The new objective function for the firms is:
           𝜋 = (1 + 𝛿𝜀𝑛𝑞 ) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛𝑛𝑞 ) + (1 + 𝛿𝜀𝑞 ) ∗ 𝑆(𝑛𝑞 ) − (𝐶 + 𝑤𝑛𝑞 ) ∗ 𝑛𝑛𝑞 − (𝐶 + 𝑤𝑞 ) ∗ 𝑛𝑞                    (25)

        The optimal choice for low-skilled workers, in turn, is similar to the one obtained in equation (10).
More productive workers receive higher wages than their low-skilled peers. In the model, this occurs
because effort is more costly for productive individuals, and employers are willing to pay a higher wage
in exchange for a bigger effort from them.
        Now, the possibility of labor outsourcing by the firms will be introduced one more time, under the
terms of the previous subsections. A firm that outsources labor has access both to high-skilled and low-
skilled labor. It pays reservation wages to every type of individual, but renders its services to the firm
producing the final good at distinct prices, so that high-skilled labor costs more than low-skilled labor.

        We therefore conclude that the gap between outsourced and non-outsourced workers must be
larger for high-skilled individuals than for low-skilled individuals.

4. Empirical analysis
        Our model yields two clear empirical predictions. First, we expect that the wage gap of outsourced
workers will be higher for more productive workers - witch contradicts some of the insights provided by
previous papers. Second, our model predicts that the gap will be greater in sectors where it is difficult to
observe effort.
        In the following sections we will analyze only the first empirical prediction of our theoretical
model. As will be discussed in subsection 4.2, we can use occupation and sector detailed classifications to
identify which workers are outsourced, but we frequently cannot tell which final firms effectively employ
the worker. This prevents us from testing the second prediction above.

4.1 Econometric model
       Seeking to test the model’s predictions, the following mincer equation will be estimated first:
                                          ln(𝑤𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝑇𝑖 + 𝑿𝒊 𝜷 + 𝑢𝑖                                      (34)


        We take the natural logarithm of the wage of individual i (𝑤𝑖 ) as function of a variable that
indicates whether the worker is outsourced (𝑇𝑖 ) and a vector of control variables (𝑿𝒊 ). We wish to assess
whether outsourced workers earn less, once relevant cofactors are controlled, such as the previously
reviewed empirical studies did.
        Next, the quantile regression framework will be used to examine wage distribution among
individuals, conditional to outsourcing and other cofactors in several quantiles of earning distribution.
Let:
                                                 ln(𝑤𝑖 ) = 𝑦𝑖                                            (35)
and
                                                      𝛼𝑇𝑖 + 𝜷𝑿𝒊 = 𝒛𝒊                                                       (36)


        Formally, the quantile regression will be estimated by:

                   min ∑ 𝜃 ∗ |ln(𝑤𝑖 ) − 𝛼𝑇𝑖 − 𝜷𝑿𝒊 | + ∑ (1 − 𝜃) ∗ |ln(𝑤𝑖 ) − 𝛼𝑇𝑖 − 𝜷𝑿𝒊 |                                   (37)
                   𝜷,𝜶
                         𝑖:𝑦≥𝑧                                   𝑖:𝑦≤𝑧



where 𝜃 indicates the quantile of analysis. We obtain a coefficient vector that minimizes the equation in
the desired quantiles and corresponds to the conditional mean of the variables of interest in the quantile 𝜃
(KOENKER and BASSET, 1978; KOENKER and HALLOCK, 2001). This analysis will allow a very
detailed decomposition of how outsourcing affects the wages of workers with different productivities.
This has not been achieved yet, in any Brazilian or international study.

4.2 Database
        We will employ micro-data from the Annual Social Information Report (RAIS) for 2014. This
data is annually reported for nearly all formal firms in Brazil and used it is used for social security
purposes. The misreport of information is subject to penalty, so most firms use specialist accountants to
register the information (ALVAREZ et al, 2017).
        RAIS contains information on several demographical characteristics of individuals and some
characteristics of the firm in which he is employed. Despite that, the database does not divide the
information for outsourced and non-outsourced workers. In order to overcome this issue, we use the
method suggested by Dube e Kaplan (2010) for the CPS in the U.S.
        Said method has been proposed by Belchior e Bertussi (2016) and consists of cross-linking data
from the Brazilian Classification of Occupations (CBO) and the National Classification of Economic
Activity (CNAE). They take advantage of the specificity of those classifications and identify outsourced
workers in a very broad selection of sectors.
        Also, we will use a identified version of the database, provided by the Work and Employment
Ministry (MTE) for the purpose of research. This particular version of the database contains information
that allow us to identify firms and individuals across time.
        Thereby, we will initially be working with about 50 million observations in the database, the size
of the Brazilian formal sector. Nonetheless, we could not use it entirely, as the estimation of the quantile
regression (described in the last subsection) becomes computationally unfeasible with that number of
observations. In order to solve this problem, we created a random sub-sample with 250 thousand
observations5 from the original database. The process to attain this sub-sample is described in Appendix
II.

4.3 Description of the Variables
        Our dependent variable is the natural logarithm of employee remuneration in December 2014 6. In
opposition to prior estimates, which used the average workers’ remuneration along the year, we chose to
use just the remuneration for the last month of the year. That is because the statements that compose the
database are given by employers, and they tend to fill in recent information more accurately (RAMOS,
2012).

5
  Once it became evident that the quantile regression estimation would not be feasible with the full sample, we created several
random samples with reduced number of observations. Starting with one million, we progressively diminished the sample until
it became estimable, at a number of 250 thousand observations. We performed the regressions on Table 1 with our random
sub-sample, and results were very similar to those found using the entire database. Besides, as will be detailed in the next
section, this sub-sample is large enough to make sure all the estimated coefficients are significant to the level of 1% in any of
the quantiles.
6
  Workers who were dismissed throughout the year were excluded from the sample.
        The control vector is formed by the following variables: education; age (on level and squared);
experience in the firm the worker is employed at (on level and squared); geographic region they live in;
sector they work in; gender; ethnicity; and size of reported establishment.
        The education variable, measured by the maximum level of instruction achieved, aims to control
the individuals’ difference in productivity7. According to human capital theory, prevalent in the
explanation of individuals’ varying remunerations, this should be a very relevant factor to the observed
wage variation (BECKER, 1975).
        The adding of age and experience at current job variables, used as proxy for the individual’s
experience in the work market, seeks to identify the presence of specific human capital, acquired with
time in the job. A quadratic term was included to detect non-linear relationships within the experience-
wage relation, since the productivity gains generated are exhausted over time (ARROW, 1962). The
variables are measured in months and point to how long the individual has worked for the same company.
        Binary variables are added to control regional segmentations in wage determination or
discrimination patterns against minorities. The Northeast region was taken as reference and dummy
variables were assigned for the other regions. The ethnicity binary variable assumes value 1 if the
individual is white, and value 0 if they belong to any other ethnic group. We also used a binary variable to
identify outsourced and non-outsourced workers, according to the classification discussed in the last
subsection.
        At last, we added establishment size to the regression as an indicator for the propensity of the
individual to receive an efficiency wage (OI and IDSON, 1999). The size of the company is defined by
the number of workers, according to the rating recommended by SEBRAE (2013) when using data from
RAIS8.

4.4 Results
        In Table 1, an estimation of equation (34) is performed. In model (1), we only perform the
regression of the wage logarithm’s variable as a function of the outsourcing dummy variable. In model
(2), are included in the regression controls of education, experience (on level and squared) and age –
consistent with human capital theory, without discrimination or segmentation in the labor market.
Ultimately, in model (3) all aforementioned variables are included.

  Our variable assumes four levels: Microenterprise (up to 9 employees), small enterprise (10 to 49 employees), medium
enterprise (50 to 99 employees) and big enterprise (more than 100 employees).
       In the first model, outsourced workers were estimated to earn approximately 34% 9 less than non-
outsourced ones. In model (2), we see that most of this penalty can be explained by the addition of control
variables. The wage difference estimated in the second model         is 13.8%. In model (3), after adding the
whole vector of control variables, the estimation for the gap goes up again, to 14.6%.
       The estimation pattern is consistent with that attained by Brazilian studies, which assessed the
impact of outsourcing on wage; but the estimates for the gap are higher in all three models and closer to
the ones achieved by international work.
       In Table 2 are arranged the results of the estimation of equation (37) for quantiles 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9.

       We can see that the estimated values for outsourcing are negative in all of the quantiles, and the
negative impact of outsourcing becomes progressively larger according to the income. Such estimates
provide empirical support to our model’s prediction that more productive workers (and, consequently,
with higher wages) suffer relatively more with outsourcing than less productive ones.


9
    To register our results we used the following correction for the coefficients: 𝑅 = (𝑒𝛽 − 1) ∗ 100.
10
     Quantile regressions were estimated from quantile 0.05 to quantile 0.95 with intervals of 0.05 between them.
5. Endogeneity bias
       It is possible that there is some form of unobserved characteristics not orthogonal to the
occupational status that drove our previous results. This section tries to account for that.

5.1 New Database
        In this section we use a confidential version of the RAIS database, described in subsection 4.2, for
the years of 2009 and 2010. Unlike the previous database, this version contains an individual unique
identifier for all workers, which allow us to follow each individual in time.
        Instead of working with all individuals, we restrict the database in 2010 only to those individuals
who were outsourced (defined in the same way as described in section 4), obtaining approximately four
and a half million observations.
        Then, we match those individuals with the database for the previous year. We have been able to
match a little less than four million individuals, approximately 86,7% of all outsourced workers in 2010 11.
In this subsample, around one and a half million individuals were not outsourced in 2009.
        Since all the workers in the new database were outsourced in 2010, we expect that all the
individuals in this subsample will have much similar characteristics and, therefore, the workers who were
outsourced in 2010 and were not in 2009 constitute a much better counter-factual than the one used in the
previous section. Next, we will re-estimate some of the previous equations with our new database.

                            Table 3 – Results of our GLS regression (34) using our new sample

        We can see that the raw gap between outsourced workers is drastically smaller in model (1) of
table 3 than the estimated in table 1 – only -4,2%. Once we add additional control variables, the estimated
gap increases to approximately -7,9%, which is still smaller than the respective models in table 1. This
results points out that, in fact, unobserved characteristics seem to explain a large part of the outsourced
wage gap.
        Next we re-estimate equation (37)12 for our database for quantiles 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9. The results are
presented in Table 4.




11
   The non matched workers were not in the formal market in 2009. The rate of matched individuals achieved with this
procedure is very similar to the matching using all formal workers done by Belchior and Bertussi (2016).
12
   Again, the estimation of the quantile regression was not computationally feasible even with the drastic reduction of the new

         First, we note that, when we control for selection bias, the wage gap is still negative and
statistically significant at the one percent level for the three quantiles. The magnitude of the wage gap,
however, is smaller than the previous in all three estimates – also indicating the importance of
unobservable effects. This effect seems to be relatively stronger for low productive workers as the
estimation for the (0.1) quantile got severely closer to zero and the estimation for the (0.9) quantile was
much closer to the original result.
         In Chart 2, we present the estimates for the marginal impact of outsourcing on wages on each
quantile in order to summarize our results. Also, for comparative purposes, we plot the previous results
for the quantile regression displayed in Chart 2.

        The graph confirms the previous conclusions drawn from Table 4. The entire distribution was
dragged up as we controlled for the unobservable characteristics. The effect, of course, is not the same for
different individuals. The coefficient for the poorest workers is slightly positive, despite not economically
or statistically significant, while for the richer individuals the coefficient is statistically indifferent for our
previous estimates. We argue that there must be unobservable individual characteristics, undesirable from
the viewpoint of the employer, that affect the occupational status of the workers. Although this
characteristics seem to be present in all distribution, they appear to be far more important for the less
productive individuals. The complete set of estimates for the quantile regression are displayed in
appendix III.
6. Conclusion
        This paper aimed to assess distinct impacts of outsourcing on different groups of workers. When
reviewing the literature on the theme, we noticed few studies have made an evaluation of the
consequences of outsourcing for different groups of workers, whereas none have made systematic
differentiations by workers or by income.
        We built a theoretical model that expands the framework developed by previous works, to an
economy with more than one sector and more than one type of worker. The model suggests the gap
between outsourced and non-outsourced workers must be larger for more productive workers, as well as
for those who work at sectors where effort observation is harder.
        Next, we used RAIS’s 2014 micro-data, along with a similar procedure to the one suggested by
Dube e Kaplan (2010) to distinguish outsourced and non-outsourced workers. Starting by conducting
estimates on the average impact of outsourcing on wages, we concluded that once all control variables are
used, outsourced workers earn about 14.5% less than their counterparts. Values found are higher than
previously estimated for Brazil, becoming closer to American and European estimates.
        Then, a quantile regression was conducted to evaluate the impact of outsourcing on workers with
different income levels (and therefore different productivities). It concluded that the impact of
outsourcing on wages grows progressively with income, as suggested by the theoretical model.
        Clearly the previous results might be driven by an unobservable form of selection. Trying to deal
with that, we use a confidential version of the RAIS database for the years of 2009 and 2010. We restrict
our sample to individuals in 2009 who could be matched across years and were outsourced in 2010
sample. Since a lot of those individuals weren't outsourced in 2009 we are able to build a much similar
control group for our analysis.
        Once we re-estimated our basic model with our new database, we found the the wage gap was
significant smaller when we controlled for unobserved characteristics – about 7,9%. Finally, we re-
estimated the quantile regression using our new subsample. Our results for the wage gap tend to get near
zero. This seem to be especially true for low productive workers. For the poorer workers in our dataset,
for example, we obtained an estimate statistically indifferent from zero while the previous result indicated
a wage penalty of almost 6%. Alternatively, for the most productive workers the estimates for the wage
gap are similar with the previous results, around 15%. Still, the results get progressively bigger as the
worker's income grows, which is consistent with our model. Overall, this paper suggests that outsourcing
tends to have negative impact on the wages of a great variety of workers. In addition, the segmentation of
the analysis endorses the efficiency wage model suggested in this study.

8. Appendix II – Creation of a Random Sub-sample

        The random sub-sample was created using the pseudo-random number generator KISS, available
in the 13th version of statistic software Stata. To carry out this procedure, first the seed s was established
in order to allow the replication of the randomization process. The seed used was 45002494 in the first
quantile regression and 98173938 for the second.
        Next, we attributed a random value to each observation in the database, extracted from a uniform
distribution with extreme values 0 and 1:
                                                  𝑋~𝑈(0,1)
        Subsequently, the samples from the database were rearranged in ascending order according to the
value attributed to them, from the previous distribution. Finally, the random sub-sample was defined as
the first 250 thousand observations from the database after the rearrangement. The full sequence of
commands is:

set seed s
gen random=runiform()
sort random
gen insample=_n <= 250000
