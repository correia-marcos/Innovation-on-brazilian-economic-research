Abstract
This paper aims to provide an initial assessment of the biopharmaceutical innovation system in Brazil by
mapping the main linkages and actors that integrate such system and by analyzing the nature of the
university-industry relationships established in crucial knowledge areas that support the biopharmaceutical
research, development and innovation (RD&I) chain. The analysis is based upon data gathered from the
Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) concerning the 2014-
2016 period. 385 public and private laboratories operating in Brazil were identified and 27% of them
established linkages with Brazilian Universities and Research Centers. Most of the university-industry
collaborations regarded the conduction of basic and applied research in pharmacy, medicine, biochemistry
and microbiology knowledge areas. FIOCRUZ, BUTANTAN, USP and UFRJ proved to be central
institutions to the network structure. National and multinational companies displayed different patterns of
interaction considering the types of relationship established and the knowledge areas involved.
Keywords: Biopharmaceuticals, university-industry relationships; knowledge networks; Brazil.

1. Introduction

Biopharmaceutical innovation involves a complex and systemic network of heterogeneous agents and
institutions, which includes sets of institutional arrangements between industrial activities and supply
chains, large and small companies, public and private organizations, Science, technology and Innovations
(S,T&I) agencies, regulatory agencies, health political bodies, public policies and intellectual property
arrangements, consumers, among many others (MALERBA; ORSENIGO, 2015). The Brazilian
biopharmaceutical innovation system is configured around the presence of different actors, such as
universities and research centers, public drug and immunobiological research and production laboratories,
biotechnology start-ups, multinational pharmaceutical companies, national pharmaceutical companies,
national political bodies and regulatory agencies, among many others national specifies (VARGAS et al,
2013; VARGAS, 2017).
The local production of generic drugs in Brazil has significantly increased the share of national firms in the
Brazilian pharmaceutical market and it represented an important turning point for the industry’s
technological learning trajectories. However, the industrial base of Brazil’s biopharmaceutical innovation
system is still limited, hampering the country’s competitive insertion in global biopharmaceutical
markets. This scenario points to the need of strengthening the capabilities building processes in new
biotechnological platforms in order to effectively enable the domestic production of biopharmaceuticals in
Brazil (VARGAS, 2017).
Biopharmaceutical activities are defined as science-based, once innovation is driven by joint advances in
basic and applied research in life and health sciences (DOSI; MAZZUCATO, 2006; PAVITT, 1984).
Biotechnology intensive activities may be understood as a set of knowledge building blocks and
technological tools that coevolve in time, as an inherently interdisciplinary and pervasive activity.
Developing Scientific and technological infrastructure and building bridges to access to external knowledge
sources are considered critical to enable biopharmaceutical innovations. New discoveries of products often
require combinations of scientific knowledge pieces from different fields – such as general biology,
molecular biology and physiology – alongside with industrial and commercial capacity, marketing skills
and complementary assets management (CORIAT et al, 2003. ELIASSON; ELIASSON, 1996). This approach
emphasizes: (1) the importance of human resources skills; (2) the need of a sufficiently diverse environment
in scientific and technological infrastructure; (3) exploitation of synergy effects between combining
knowledge fields and technological tools to foster the development of new marketable drugs (ELIASSON;
ELIASSON, 1996).
The links between science and technology spheres may articulate diverse and complex configurations given
the specificities of each science and innovation systems (CORIAT et al, 2003). The academic literature
highlights the importance of universities and research institutes according to three main functions: 1)
Education; 2) Research; and 3) Entrepreneurial role of universities (MOWERY; SAMPAT, 2005).
This paper provides an initial assessment of the biopharmaceutical innovation system in Brazil by mapping
the main groups of actors that integrate such system and by analyzing the importance and nature of
the university-industry relationships in crucial areas to the biopharmaceutical research, development and
innovation chain (RD&I). In doing so the paper intends to shed light in the main differences in interaction
patterns between national and multinational companies, in view of their demand for R&D projects
throughout the different stages of the biopharmaceutical R&D chain, and to highlight the importance of
certain S,T&I organizations as the most relevant links due to their centrality in the formation of knowledge
networks in biopharmaceutical activities in Brazil.
The paper is organized as follows. Next section presents the methodological aspects. The third section
presents the theoretical basis that support the analysis held in the study and a brief overview on the
Brazilian scientific and technological infrastructure evolution regarding academic institutions and
university-industry relationships. The fourth section is dedicated to the identified industrial actors and the
knowledge network analyses resulting from their collaborations with universities and research centers
during the 2014-2016 period. The fifth section presents the study main findings, followed by the
conclusions and the references.

2. Methodological Aspects

The research is based upon data gathered from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and
Technological Development (CNPq) regarding biological and health sciences. The CNPq database
discloses information such as: (1) Number of research groups, research lines, researchers per knowledge
areas; (2) General information about enterprises and S&T institutions involved in university-industry
relationships, such as: name, identification code, economic activity classifications and geographic location;
(3) Types of university-industry interactions defined by final purposes5. CNPq disclosures data according
to biannual censuses from the year 2000 to 2016, except for the year 2012. To investigate university-
industry relationships were collected microdata regarding the period 2014-2016.
Biological and health sciences are composed by 22 knowledge areas6. Thirteen closely biopharmaceutical
related knowledge field were selected7: Biochemistry, Biophysics, General biology, Genetics,
Immunology, Medicine, Microbiology, Morphology, Parasitology, Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Physiology
and Biotechnology.
It is worth mentioning that as the CNPq dataset is built upon voluntary declarations by the academic
research groups. The indicators may be undervalued due to understatement patterns. Also, the dataset is
characterized by double counting issues: (1) The same researcher can integrate more than one research
group; (2) Enterprises can establish relationships with several research groups; (3) University-industry
relationships are classified according to three final objectives. Despite the limitations, the CNPq database
is the main reference for university-industry relationship analyses in Brazil.
A sample of Brazilian pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical enterprises was sort using several sources of
information8. Alves (2017) provides a list of 137 bioscience firms and 96 biotechnology firms with
applications in human health, both constituted as knowledge intensive entrepreneurships (MALERBA;
MCKELVEY, 2016). The Brazilian Drug Market Regulation Chamber Annual Statistics (CMED, 2016)
provides data concerning 214 national and multinational pharmaceutical companies9 established in Brazil.
The Association of Official Pharmaceutical Laboratories of Brazil (ALFOB, 2018) provides data on 21
associated laboratories. A prospective study has been conducted based on the list of industrial partners from
the CNPq 2010 and the 2016 censuses database, concerning enterprises cataloged under The Brazilian
National Classification of Economic Activities (CNAE) codes: Experimental Research and Development
in the Physical and Natural Sciences (7210)10 and Manufacture of Medicinal Products for Human Use

  According to the CMED (2016), 103 companies are involved in production and development of new drugs, 64 are involved in
biological drugs segment, 89 are related to generic drugs segment, 159 to biological similar drugs segment and 93 companies
are involved in specific-targeted medicines. CMED (2016) does not provide the list of companies related to each market segment,
thus all 214 companies were considered, except for 8 companies that were either distribution only companies or lacked basic
corporate information such as CNPJ ID numbers.
10
   Bioscience and biotechnology firms may be catalogued under 28 different CNAE codes. Development in the Physical and
Natural Sciences (7210) represented the most frequent used code to describe the segment (ALVES, 2017).
(2121). The sample was identified according to the Brazilian National Register of Legal Entities that
provides an identification code for each organization established in Brazil (CNPJ ID numbers), enabling
the comparison to the Census 2016 university-industry relationships CNPq microdata.
The network analysis is based on graph theory. A graph is a graphic diagrammatic abstract representation
of an interconnected structure composed by a set of elements called nodes that are tied in pairs by one or
more types of interdependency. The analysis is based on undirected and finite graphs; therefore, the edges
have no specific orientation11. The networks are mostly bipartite due to data restrictions; thus, enterprises
are able to connect to research groups but not to other enterprises. Interactions among research groups were
also restricted. The metrics analyzed are: Number of nodes and ties; Centrality metrics indicating the
importance of the nodes based on their connections; Betweenness centrality, measuring centrality based on
vertices shortest paths; Degree metrics considering the number of ties to other actors in the network;
Clustering coefficient, a measuring the degree to which nodes end to cluster together; Hyperlink-Induced
Topic Search (HITS) metrics showing hubs and authority relations in the network; and Density that
measurers proportion of ties in a network relative to the total number of possible interactions (WASSERMAN;
FAUST, 1994). The networks are presented so that colors represent betweenness centrality metrics and node
sizes represent hub measurements.

3. Theoretical Basis

Since the emergence of the biotechnology as a new technological paradigm in the late 1970’s, the
pharmaceutical innovation system has faced a large scale entry of new specialized biotechnology firms
dedicated to exploring technological opportunities in very specific niches of knowledge, mostly generated
within academic institutions (MCKELVEY; ORSENIGO, 2001). Despite the high and persistent entry rates,
the entrants have not become fully integrated drug producers and were not able to reduce the market share
of large pharmaceutical incumbent firms. The rising costs of the R,D&I chain; the scale and scope
economies in R&D and marketing; the long and costly clinical trials phases; the regulatory affairs and drug
approval requirements have favored the emergence of a dense network of collaborations and strategic
alliances between heterogeneous organizations to access external knowledge sources and complementary
assets that are critical to develop and delivery new drugs (ARORA; GAMBARDELLA, 1995. GRAVAGLIA et al,
2006. BALCONI; LORENZI, 2017. MALERBA; ORSENIGO, 2015).
In the last decades, the biopharmaceutical innovation systems have been marked by evolutionary changes
and self-reinforcing dynamics concerning the search for more cost-effective models for drug development
and efforts to reduce large companies’ internal R&D structure, as well as an increasing tendency towards
the global outsourcing of a broad set of technological services regarding drug discovery, clinical trials and
production phases (BALCONI; LORENZI, 2017. MALERBA; ORSENIGO, 2015).
The alliances involving big pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms and, remarkably, academic
institutions and public laboratories enable firms to benefit from governmental funding and increased
flexibility (SCHUHMACHER et al, 2016. BALCONI; LORENZI, 2017). The biopharmaceutical innovation
system is filled with a growing number of very specialized biotechnology firms with limited internal
capabilities that rely constantly on the funding provided by large global biopharmaceutical companies and
on specialized services provided by Contract Research Organizations (CROs) and Contract Manufacturing
Organizations (CMOs). The industrial infrastructure composed by very specialized capabilities’ carriers
facilitates entry conditions and firm heterogeneity, alongside with a concentration tendency due to increased
mergers and acquisitions operations. The biopharmaceutical R,D&I chain displays a tendency towards
technological specialization and vertical disintegration, as it becomes increasingly advantageous to
outsource specific technological task to highly specialized know-how intensive partners (BALCONI;
LORENZI, 2017. SCHUHMACHER et al, 2016).


11
  The undirected graph choice is justified by the fact that the database classifies each established link up to three different types
of interactions and 67% of total types of interactions are undirected edges. Thus, the analytic benefits of using directed graphs
networks would be quite limited.
The vertical disintegration process has been accompanied by the geographic expansion of drug
developmental stages and manufacturing activities enabling the incorporation of new participants from
emerging countries. Large multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are increasingly
focused in emerging markets, while biopharmaceutical companies from emerging markets target global
markets in specific niches – such as generic and similar drugs – and integrate themselves in global value
chains thought technological services provision (REZAIE; SINGER, 2010. REZAIE et al, 2012. BALCONI;
LORENZI, 2017). Even though biopharmaceutical activities have been fostered in many countries by
promoting technology transfer, academic entrepreneurship, venture capital provision and property rights
regulations, attempts to replicate developed countries experiences have most often failed due to the multiple
complex national idiosyncrasies of each System of Innovation (MALERBA; ORSENIGO, 2015).
Developing countries specialization patterns and potential virtuous insertion into global value chains
reflects a specific combination of multiple complex aspects of national innovation systems regarding
industrial capacity, skilled labor disposal, national institutional arrangements, universities and research
institutes, knowledge spillovers and networks, country-specific resources, public provision of health
services and medicines and other national economic, political, social, institutional and historical specifies
(REZAIE; SINGER, 2010. REZAIE et al, 2012. BALCONI; LORENZI, 2017. MALERBA; ORSENIGO, 2015). Yet,
excellence in academic research in a broad and interdisciplinary set of knowledge areas, the integration of
highly developed scientific skills to all innovative process dimensions and public funding to biomedical
research are crucial elements to develop biopharmaceutical activities (MALERBA; ORSENIGO, 2015).
Traditionally, health enterprises in developing countries – like China, India and Brazil – have focused their
activities in low cost manufacturing, imitation and adaptation strategies of products originally developed in
higher income countries, as a feasible way to offer quality products at affordable prices to attend domestic
and global health needs. A common strategy has been to concentrate efforts in products that are financially
and technically less demanding – enabling internal competence and capabilities building process in R&D,
manufacturing and distribution, as well as revenues improvements – before venturing into more
sophisticated initiatives. Over the past decades, many emerging market’ firms have managed to leverage
innovation processes and to reduce production costs, strengthening domestic industries and enabling firms
to pursue riskier technological activities towards neglected diseases12, noncommunicable chronic diseases,
diagnosis and other therapeutic areas. However, few enterprises in developing countries are set to develop
and deliver novel drugs to global markets, as they often lack the technical know-how and financial resources
required to intake radical innovation processes and associated risks. Promising innovation leads in emerging
countries are more likely to focus on specific pipelines or collaborative developments schemes with global
established corporations (REZAIE; SINGER, 2010. REZAIE et al, 2012. BALCONI; LORENZI, 2017).
Overall, companies from emerging markets have expanded domestic and global population access to health
products based on cost advantages models and increased products affordability, however these firms cannot
eliminate health access gap and expand targeted markets on their own (ROEMER-MAHLER, 2014). While
technology transfer through foreign direct investment, reverse engineering strategies, alliances, and cross-
border partnerships have played key role to pharmaceutical sector growth in developing countries,
indigenous innovation models and capabilities building processes have gained increased attention in
countries like Brazil, South Africa, China and India (REZAIE; SINGER, 2010. REZAIE et al, 2012).

3.1 The Brazilian biopharmaceutical innovation system

The Brazilian biopharmaceutical innovation system is populated by different sets of interconnected
companies and institutions. Health and S,T&I institutions, public policies, state procurement policies to
attend the national health system demands, regulatory agencies, institutional arrangements, suppliers,
hospitals engaged in clinical trials and other R,D&I activities, intermediary and final users are some of the

12
  Tropical neglected diseases and epidemies that affect mostly developing countries may represent an important window of
opportunities for enhancing indigenous innovative capacity of domestic enterprises, as global pharmaceutical established
corporations headquartered in high income countries tend not to develop drugs targeting diseases that are most common to affect
only low income countries (REZAIE; SINGER, 2010).
key components that integrate and shape the Brazilian biopharmaceutical innovation system (VARGAS et
al, 2013; VARGAS, 2017). Despite the acknowledged importance of the broad set of actors, linkages and
context specificities, this study is mainly focused on industrial actors and their connections to S&T
institutions, remarkably: i) biotechnology and bioscience firms operating in very specific niches of the
biopharmaceutical R,D&I chain, ii) public laboratories, (iii) multinational pharmaceutical companies, (iv)
national pharmaceutical companies and v) universities and research centers.
The Brazilian health biotech industry is populated by a growing number of young, small sized enterprises
dedicated to performing R,D&I activities and to provide specialized technological services based on recent
advances in life and health sciences. The companies are highly concentrated in the southeast region of
Brazil. Most firms are still in the pre-operational phase; mainly controlled by national capital and strongly
related to national academic institutions. There are approximately 300 bioscience firms and between 175
and 240 biotechnology firms in Brazil dedicated to many fields, such as human health, reagents, agriculture,
animal health, bioenergy and environment. The companies dedicated to human health correspond to an
average 40% of the total number of companies. A recent assessment of the Brazilian health biotech sector
has identified and mapped 271 bioscience companies, 137 health bioscience companies and 96 health
biotechnology companies (ALVES et al., 2018. ALVES, 2017).
Public research and production laboratories represent an important feature of Brazilian Health Industrial
Complex13. The public infrastructure for research and production of vaccines and essential drugs dates to
the beginning of the 20th century and regards the need to combat epidemics such as bubonic plague, yellow
fever and cholera in Brazil (CHAVES et al, 2016). The first public institutes created in Brazil were Butantan
Institute in 1899 and Manguinhos Serotherapies’ Institute14 in 1990. Nowadays, there are 22 public
laboratories currently operating in Brazil that are responsible for attending about 80% of the Brazilian
public demand for vaccines and 10% of the produced drugs amount in Brazil (GADELHA et al, 2012; REZAIE
et al, 2012).
The large multinational pharmaceutical laboratories, established in Brazil since the 1950’s, held around
51,49% of the Brazilian pharmaceutical market in 2018 (SINDUSFARMA, 2018). Historically, the
multinational companies bring their production and distribution stages to Brazil but are most likely to keep
their innovative efforts concentrated in their headquarters worldwide. Pharmaceutical world leaders tend to
spend an average 20% of their sales revenues in R&D activities in their origin countries (PARANHOS et al.,
2018). According to data retrieved from the Brazilian Innovation Survey, multinational companies invested
only 0,38% to 1,4% of their sales revenues in R&D activities in Brazil from year 2000 to 2014, while the
national pharmaceutical laboratories accounted for 0,71% to 5,1% invested sales revenues in the same
period (SZAPIRO et al., 2017).
Even though pharmaceutical national companies’ R&D expenditures are still limited compared to the
pharmaceutical world leaders, the local production of generic drugs has significantly increased the share of
national firms in the Brazilian pharmaceutical market and enabled critical technological learning processes.
The national laboratories share in the Brazilian pharmaceutical market increased from 32% in 2003
(GADELHA et al., 2012), to 42,99 % in 2012 and 48,51% in 2018 (SINDUSFARMA, 2018). The innovation
rate in pharmaceutical activities has increased from 46,8% in 1998-2000, to 63,7% in 2006-2008 and 52,2%
in 2012-2014, overcoming the average industrial innovation rates in Brazil. And the amount of innovative
expenditures destinated to internal and external R&D efforts increased from 26,1% in the year 2000 to 62%
in 2014 according to data retrieved from the Brazilian Innovation Survey (SZAPIRO ET AL, 2017).
Brazilian pharmaceutical companies’ strategies toward biological drugs production are mostly directed to
biosimilars or bioequivalent market niche. Biosimilar drugs are defined as "near-duplicates" of patent-
expired biopharmaceuticals. Due to the technological complexity involved in biotechnological processes,
13
   The Brazilian Health Industrial Complex (CEIS) is an analytical dimension of the Brazilian National System of Innovation in
Health aimed to focus on productive components dedicated to the provision of health goods and services and involved in the
dynamics of health innovation in Brazil. The adoption of the CEIS concept makes it possible to isolate components of the health
complex in specific subsystems by identifying sectors of activity and technological paradigms, such as chemical,
biotechnological, mechanical, electronic and materials (GADELHA ET AL., 2013).
14
   Which later became the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ).
even the copying activities require amassing scientific and technological capabilities (VARGAS, 2017;
GOMES, 2014).
The       entrance    into      biological     drugs’     market     involved,      in      some      cases,
the creation of pharmaceutical joint ventures. Bionovis and Orygen are two joint ventures in pre-operational
phase created in 2012. Bionovis was created by the national pharmaceuticals Aché, EMS, Hypermarcas
and União Química and has established technical collaboration agreements with the public laboratory Bio-
Manguinhos – integrated in Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) – and with two world market companies
Janssen and Merck. Orygen was created by the national companies Biolab and Eurofarma and has
collaboration agreements with EPIRUS and Pfizer. The joint ventures have jointly received 401 million
Reais (approximately US$ 105 million) investments from the Brazilian National Economic and Social
Development Bank (BNDES) for funding their industrial units and developing innovation, production and
marketing activities. It is expected that Orygen launches five and Bionovis launches eight biosimilar
products in the national market in the next few years (BNDES, 2016, EXAME, 2016).
Despite the focus in biosimilar drugs, some established companies within national market – like Cristália,
Eurofarma and Aché Laboratories – are deploying efforts to incorporate biotechnological routes15 in
manufacturing large molecules and in innovative drugs discovery (VARGAS, 2017; REZAIE et al, 2012).
National biopharmaceutical innovative efforts have been strongly encouraged by public policies in Brazil
due to its strategic importance to the Brazilian Health Industrial Complex sustainable growth and
technological catch-up efforts. A systemic perspective of the industrial and the ST&I policies in the health
sector has allowed the adoption of a wide range of instruments to support the development of
biopharmaceutical activities in Brazil. Such instruments have involved not only direct promotion to R&D
activities in national companies and public investments on S&T infrastructure, but also other strategies to
support innovation, such as the review of the regulatory framework and the use of government purchasing
power. The industrial policy mechanisms and S,T&I incentives are mostly aimed at supporting national
pharmaceutical companies’ innovative efforts and to broaden biopharmaceutical R,D&I chain in the
country (VARGAS et al, 2013; VARGAS. BRITTO, 2014).

3.2. Scientific and technological capabilities in biopharmaceutical related knowledge areas in Brazil.

Although not directly involved in production activities, universities and research centers play a central role
in the Brazilian Biopharmaceutical Innovation System. In addition to teaching and research activities,
universities operate as a catalytic center for information flows from their own research and from
interactions with companies, regulatory agencies, hospitals, clinics, medical centers and other actors that
transmit new demands to the national pharmaceutical industry (ALBUQUERQUE; CASSIOLATO, 2002). The
knowledge transfer between academic and productive spheres is particularly important to enable the
development of products and services that are adequate to attend the specific phytosanitary standard
requirements in Brazil. Strengthening collaborative relationships is also key to promote activities
increasingly integrated to the Brazilian Health Industrial Complex and to strengthen innovation capacity
(BRITTO et al, 2012).
Brazil has a wide range of academic institutions with consolidated research groups in biology and health
sciences. The national share in internationally indexed publications grew at 9,6% average annual rate from
2000 to 2015, indicating the S&T infrastructure strengthening tendency (ALVES, 2017). The current stage
of development of biotechnology in Brazil is largely due to the human resource training policy promoted
by institutions such as the Higher Education Personnel Improvement Coordinator (CAPES) and CNPq. It is
important to highlight that the industrial and S,T&I policies also incorporated instruments to stimulate the
interactions between the industry and the universities and research centers. (BRITTO et al, 2012; VARGAS.
BRITTO, 2014).


15
  Pharmaceutical chemical and biotechnological routes are complementary. Amassing capabilities in chemical procedures are
often required to enable the adopting of biotechnology in pharmaceutical R&D and production activities (ALVES, 2017).
The data collected from the CNPq directory from 2000 to 2016, shows a significant growth in the number
of research groups, research lines and number of researchers dedicated to knowledge fields in biological
and health sciences. Table 1 shows that the number of research groups in critical knowledge areas grew
(13%, average) during 2000-2016 period, as well as the number of research lines (17%) and the number of
researchers (21%). The thirteen critical knowledge areas selected for the analysis represented an average
15% of total research groups in the CNPq directory, while biological and health correspond to 12% and
16% respectively. The data points to an average growth of selected areas that is overlapped by the average
growth of health sciences and the entire set of CNPq areas. As a result, the share of selected areas research
groups in comparison to CNPq is decreasing over the years, going from 17% in the 2000 to 12% in 2016
regarding research groups; from 18% to 13% regarding research lines and from 15% to 12% regarding the
number of researchers in the analyzed period.

The existing gap between national scientific output in strategic knowledge areas and the technological
applications is one of the main bottlenecks for national industry’s innovative capacity building. Despite the
strong scientific research capacity in the country, the research community is strongly oriented to pure
academic activities and has an uneven development according to the area of activity (CHIARINI et al., 2013).
The number of research groups that reported active relationships with the productive sector grew 72% on
average in selected areas from the year 2002 to 2016, overlapping in great amount the 54% average growth
rate experienced by CNPq total interactions (Table 2). However, the growth in biological sciences (82%)
is more prominent than the selected areas growth in the same period. The proportion of selected areas in
CNPq collaborative groups grew from 11% in 2002 to 15% in 2016.

The academic laboratories’ lack of good practices certification and delays in admirative procedures
constrain university-industry knowledge transfers. Challenges also arise from structural problems in the
Brazilian innovation system. S&T institutions often act as technological service providers due to the
absence of private companies in some critical stages of pharmaceutical R&D value chain. Historically, the
low innovative patterns of generic-based Brazilian pharmaceuticals impact the quality and the duration of
university-industry relationships. Many university-industry interactions in Brazil arise from national private
companies’ need to solve specific problem in R&D stages, however these problems are often low complex
and easily solved based on existing knowledge. Despite the existence of highly qualified personnel in the
industry, only 11% of full time scientist located in pharmaceuticals companies’ R&D laboratories in 2014
in Brazil had post-graduation degrees. Hiring graduate degree students could improve national
pharmaceutical absorption capacity and ease the access to external sources of knowledge, as graduates may
act as knowledge gate keepers building bridges with academic research groups. However, the issue is
mostly associated with limited private companies’ strategies towards innovation rather than to failures in
the Brazilian academic system (PARANHOS et al., 2018; CHIARINI et al., 2013; BRITTO et al, 2012).

4. Collaborative relationships between research groups and the industrial sphere: A Knowledge
Network analysis

According to the proposed methodology, were identified 385 productive actors: 102 small and medium
sized health bioscience firms, 148 Brazilian pharmaceutical companies16, 23 Brazilian Public
Laboratories17 and 112 multinational pharma companies established in the country. Most of the companies
and public laboratories identified in the sample are in Brazilian southeast region18, especially in São Paulo
(52%) and Rio de Janeiro (16%).
A low percentage (27%) of the 385 sampled actors established interactions with academic research groups
according to CNPq 2016 data: 243 university-industry relationships were established between 103
industrial partners and 63 Brazilian S&T institutions. There are no available patterns to evaluate the
university-industry frequency, but the results are considered rather lower than expected considering
knowledge-based activities.
As many Public Laboratories operate both drugs and vaccines producers and as S&T institutions, some
interactions may regard strictly inter-academic relationships19.
Table 3 shows the obtained results. Public Laboratories concentrate most of the interactions, as 12
laboratories represent 38% of total interactions. National laboratories represented 84% of total interactions
and accounted for 78.6% of all laboratories engaged in university-industry relationships. National
pharmaceutical companies also established a higher indicator of interaction per interactive partners (1.9)
compared to multinational pharmaceutical companies (1.7).

   The biotechnology state owned companie Biobrás was incorporated in the public laboratories list.
18
   Many companies are established in more than one location. Were identified 439 geographical coordinates referred to the 385
sample.
19
   Interactions established by 3 Public laboratories were not considered because they have shared Universities’ CNPJ IDs:
CERTBIO, IPEFARM and NUPLAM. FIOCRUZ interactions not identified as BIOMANGUINHOS or FARMANGUINHOS
were discarded to avoid university-university interactions counting issues. Table 3 indicators consider only 20 Publics
Laboratories and 382 sample size. The 27% interactive indicator was only marginally affected.

Most relevant knowledge areas in university-industry relationships were pharmacy (24%), medicine (18%),
biochemistry (14%) and microbiology (9%). Pharmacy was highly relevant for bioscience firms (20%) and
Brazilian pharmaceutical companies (55%) . Biochemistry, genetics and microbiology were relevant areas
for bioscience firms (48%) and public laboratories (36%). Medicine was critical to the multinational
pharmaceutical companies (53%), and to a lesser extent to public laboratories (20%). While interactions in
pharmacy, biochemistry, genetics and microbiology may be related to the conduction of R&D activities in
new compounds, interactions in medicine were probably related to the importance of clinical trials and
product adequacy procedures. Further empirical inquiries are suggested to verify these assumptions.
Biotechnology itself has only been introduced as a CNPq discipline in the year 2016, thus it is not yet
significant.
The thirteen selected knowledge areas represent 92% of total interactions, as shown in Table 4. Thus, the
selected areas represent a good proxy for knowledge areas that are critical to biopharmaceutical activities.

The university-industry relationships took place involving mostly industrial partners located in São Paulo
(42%), Rio de Janeiro (16%), Minas Gerais (15%) and Paraná (12%) and S&T Institutions located in Rio
de Janeiro (26%) and São Paulo (24%).
There were 98 interactions involving industrial partners and S&T institutions located in different federal
units and 145 interactions within the same federal units. Most frequently S&T institutions involved in inter-
state interactions were the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation – FIOCRUZ (16), the Federal University of
Pernambuco – UFPE (8), the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro – UFRJ (7), Federal University of Minas
Gerais – UFMG (5) and the Brazilian National Commission of Nuclear Energy – CNEN (5). Inter-state
interactions are potentially correlated with research quality and academic excellence.
Table 5 shows university-industry interactions classified by types if relationship, considering three possible
types for each interaction established. During 2014-2016 period, 382 types of relationships were reported
in the database. Basic and applied research were the most frequent types of interactions (58% of total types
of interactions). Basic research was more frequent among public laboratories (55) and multinational
pharmaceutical companies (20), while applied research occurred more often within bioscience firms (25),
national pharmaceutical companies (40) and public laboratories (37).
Technology transfer from group to partner and input supply from partner to group were also significant.
However, knowledge must flow in both ways (from group to partner and from partner to group) to enable
effective technological transfers. There were low evidences of both ways’ technological transfers (only 8
pairs of tied nodes).

The knowledge networks are composed by multiple interactions between enterprises, public laboratories
and S&T institutions. The analysis held considered subgraphs for each type of industrial partner, enabling
the evaluation of different patterns among them. The main network statistics are summarized in Table 6.
The subgraph composed by interconnected bioscience firms and S&T Institutions is shown in Figure 1. The
network main hubs were the companies Biomm (0.418) and Biozeus (0.318), besides the S&T Institutions:
USP (0.362); UFRJ (0.289). Most important nodes according to betweenness centrality measures were
UFRJ (158.0); USP (137.0); Biozeus (119.0); BIOMM (117.9) and, to a lesser extent, FIOCRUZ (57.0).
When weakly connected components are excluded from the network (Figure 1.1), it is possible to identify:
the importance of Biomm in connecting indirectly USP to UFRJ; the star structure formation around
Biozeus, UFRJ and USP. The star structures around central nodes and the absence of clear cluster structures
are a direct consequence of the database limitations regarding the bipartite networks.
Figure 2 shows the Brazilian pharmaceutical companies and S&T Institutions subgraph. The network main
hub was the pharmaceutical company Cristália (0.565). Other important hubs are UFPE (0.391), USP
(0.256) and BUTANTAN (0.254) – which operates as both public laboratory and research center. It is
possible to identify a star structure configured around the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul
(UFRGS), even though this structure is completely disconnected from the graph main tree. When weakly
connected components are excluded (Figure 2.1), it becomes easier to identify: the multiple undirected
connections between Cristália, USP and Butantan; and the direct connections between Cristália and the star
UFPE.
Figure 3 shows Brazilian Public Laboratories and S&T institutions subgraph. It is important to remark that
some laboratories also operate as research institute and even as teaching facilities. The interactions shown
in Figure 4 were selected to avoid strictly academic linkages. It is, however, difficult to isolate productive
activities from research and academic ones. The main hubs were BUTANTAN (0.604), Ezequiel Dias
Foundation – FUNED (0.351), FIOCRUZ (0.294), the Federal University of Paraná – UFPR (0.193) and
CNEN (0.186). The average clustering coefficient of the network is 0,095 and it presents total 3 triangles,
reflecting a more complex network than all the other subgraphs20, which displayed null average clustering
coefficient. Most relevant institutions based on clustering coefficient metrics were CNEN (1.0), UFPR
(0.333), FUNED (0.054), FIOCRUZ (0.027), BUTANTAN (0.014). When weakly connected components
are excluded (Figure 3.1), it becomes clear the importance of CNEN and UFPR for connecting the stars
BUTANTAN and FUNED; the role played by UNESP, IBMP, IVB, UFRJ, UFMS and UERJ in indirectly
connecting BUTANTAN to FIOCRUZ; and also the importance of UFF acting as a bridge between FUNED
and FIOCRUZ.
Figure 4 shows the multinational pharmaceutical companies established in Brazil and national S&T
institutions subgraph. The main hubs were GlaxoSmithKline (0.465) and USP (0.367), followed by the
companies Merck Sharp and Dohme (0.252), Elli Lilly (0.222), AtraZeneca (0.222), Abott (0.222) Merk
(0.216) and the universities USP (0.367), UFRJ (0.366), The Federal University of São Paulo – UNIFESP
(0.181) and UFMG (0.166). Figure 4.1 display the reduced network. The structure analysis highlights the
importance of AstraZeneca, Elli Lilly, Abott and UNIFESP in connecting the stars USP to UFRJ; and the
role played by MSD and MERK working as bridges between UFMG and USP.

  The positive clustering coefficient is a consequence of the fact that Public Laboratories may operate as both S&T institutions
and productive actors. So that Network 3 is not necessarily bipartite.
Figure 5 displays the complete graph considering the five previously presented subgraphs. The network
gathered 164 nodes and 185 ties. The average clustering coefficient was 0.026 and there were 5 triangles.
The main hubs in the knowledge network became even more visible: BUTANTAN (0.527), USP (0.310),
FIOCRUZ (0.265), FUNED (0.230), UFRJ (0.188) and UNESP (0.161). The national pharmaceutical
company Cristália (0.205) and the multinational GlaxoSmithKline (0.157) appear as highly important hubs.
The betweenness centrality measures also indicated the importance of UFPE (1932.95), UFMG (1082.45)
and UFGRS (1071.46), aside from BUTANTAN (4403.61), Cristália (3166.38), FIOCRUZ (2315.15), USP
(1980.58), UFPE (1932.95), UFRJ (1647.46) and FUNED (1348.78). Considering the clustering
coefficient, the national pharmaceutical companies Biolab (1.0) and Cristália (0.047), alongside with CNEN
(0.33), UFPR (0.1), FUNED (0.054), BUTANTAN (0.016), USP (0.014) and FIOCRUZ (0.010) were
highly important nodes for connecting two or more important hubs in the network.




The interactive S&T institutions also interacted with other universities and research centers. Figure 6 shows
the previous network including strictly academic relationships between Brazilian S&T institutions in
biological and health sciences21. The extended graph gathered 401 nodes and 1686 ties. The average
clustering coefficient was 0.667 associated with 4637 total triangles. Biopharmaceutical industrial actors
21
     Were considered only relationships in which identified S&T institutions engaged as partners with other S&T institutions.
are, thus, indirectly connected to a broader and much more complex knowledge network in national S&T
sphere. Some S&T institutions – such as USP, FIOCRUZ, UFRJ, The State University of Campinas –
UNICAMP, UNESP, UNIFESP, UFMG and UFRGS – operate as knowledge gatekeepers, connecting
many knowledge sources around them. Betweenness centrality measures highlighted the critical role of
USP (16934.29), FIOCRUZ (9090.22), UFRJ (8768.23), UFRGS (8302.08) and UFMG (6933.07).
Strictly academic linkages were also identified within international context. Figure 7 includes interactions
established between interactive Brazilian S&T institutions and foreign partners in biological and health
sciences. The network is composed by 725 nodes and 1049 ties. The average clustering coefficient: 0.006
and there are 6 triangles. Brazilian S&T institutions – such as USP, FIOCRUZ, UFRJ and BUTANTAN –
operate as critical gatekeepers integrating the national S&T infrastructure to foreign external sources of
knowledge, and indirectly linking the Brazilian Biopharmaceutical Innovation System to the knowledge
created within highly respected S&T institutions abroad22.
Relationships involve 560 Foreign Institutions, such as: Université Laval (8),     Escola    Superior     de
Enfermagem de Coimbra (7), Karolinska Institutet (7), University of British Columbia (7), University of
Oxford (7), Harvard Medical School (6), McGill University (6), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (6),

5. Main findings

Brazil has a consolidated S&T infrastructure characterized by a growing number of research groups,
research lines and researchers during the period 2000-2016. A major challenge is the current misalignment

22
     These institutions also operate as central nodes according to betweenness centrality measures.
between S&T research indicators and technological applications in innovative efforts regarding activities
considered strategic by policy makers and policy goals, as well as an uneven advance in soft sciences23 and
hard sciences24 (CHIARINI et al, 2013). The decrease in the ratio of the thirteen selected knowledge areas in
health and biological sciences considered critical to foster biopharmaceutical R,D&I value chain activities
compared to the total CNPq knowledge areas in 2000-2016 period corroborates the misalignment argument.
Despite the loss in terms National S&T indicators share, the overall increase in university-industry
relationships points to an indigenous capability building process undertaken in knowledge areas that are
critical to support Biopharmaceutical developments in Brazil.
The analysis held is based on a 385 sized sample of industrial actors allegedly involved in
biopharmaceutical activities in Brazil, composed mainly by bioscience firms (26%), Brazilian
pharmaceutical companies (38%) and multinational companies established in the country (29%). Most of
the sampled companies and public laboratories are established in the Brazilian southeast region, mainly in
São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
According to CNPq 2016 database, 103 biopharmaceutical industrial partners established 243 interactions
with 63 universities and research centers in Brazil during the period 2014-2016. The considerable low
university-industry interaction rate (27%) may reflect either a gap between S&T output and Industrial
technological applications – due to a low innovative pattern associated to several pharmaceutical companies
–; a university bias towards strictly academic activities or a consequence of the CNPq Directory
understatement pattern. Further studies are suggested to evaluate the impacts of self-declaration model in
the CNPq interaction database.
Most interactions were established within pharmacy (24%), medicine (18%), biochemistry (14%) and
microbiology (9%) knowledge areas. While bioscience firms, Brazilian pharmaceutical companies and
public laboratories interacted mostly with research groups from pharmacy, biochemistry, genetics and
microbiology areas, multinational companies interacted mostly with groups involved in medicine
knowledge area. The first indicates active R&D activities in new biopharmaceutical compounds being
conducted by Brazilian companies and public laboratories, while the latter indicates potential multinational
involvements in clinical trials and product adequacy procedures. Further empirical studies are suggested to
verify the correlation between knowledge areas and possible technological applications in industrial sphere.
The geographic dispersion of interactions followed the patterns of concentration displayed by sampled
companies, mainly located in the Brazilian southeast region. Industrial partners were mostly located in São
Paulo (42%), Rio de Janeiro (16%), Minas Gerais (15%) and Paraná (12%), while interactive S&T
Institutions were often based in Rio de Janeiro (26%) and São Paulo (24%). Locational proximity plays a
distinguished role in the university-industry relationships as 60% of interactions have been established
within the limits of the most prominent Federal Units. The 40% inter federal unit interactions indicates the
importance of high quality centers such as FIOCRUZ and UFRJ.
Concerning the types of interaction, 58% of total relationships regarded jointly conducted basic and applied
research, indicating good quality relationships in terms of capacity to generate possible commercial
applications. Applied research occurred more often involving public laboratories, bioscience firms and
Brazilian pharmaceutical companies, indicating innovative efforts held by the national laboratories. Basic
research involved mainly multinationals and public laboratories, indicating the involvement of both
segments in more complex, riskier and longer term R&D activities, as well as a bigger absorptive capacity
developed by these companies and public laboratories. It is possible that multinational companies’ activities
involving clinical trials’ procedures may have been declared as research without immediate application due
to research groups’ self-declaration data collection bias. Further studies using clinical trials database and
interviews are suggested to investigate such possibility. A major concern regards the limited occurrence of


23
   Law, Finance, Literature and social applied knowledge areas (CHIARINI et al, 2013)
24
   Mathematics, engineering and most of the knowledge areas that are considered strategic to Brazilian industrial development,
such as Software, Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, semiconductors, capital goods and bioenergy (CHIARINI et
al, 2013).
bilateral types of interactions – such as technological transfers from group to partner and from partner to
group – jeopardizing effective knowledge flows.
According to the network metrics summarized in Table 6 below, despite the bioscience firms’ network
displayed the highest number of nodes in comparison to other industrial segments (62), the network density
is rather low (0,023), and a high number of weakly connecting nodes is perceived (18). The result
compatible with the presence of several academic spinoffs that integrate such segment – new companies
that are still building basic competences and capabilities – which tend to be linked only to their origin
university.
Only a few percentage (23%) of the identified Brazilian Pharmaceutical companies interacted with
Brazilian S&T Institutions. The reduced rate of interactive partners among identified companies is probably
associated with the average low innovative performance of many Brazilian pharmaceutical enterprises.
However, the firms engaged in university-industry relationships were more likely to stablish linkages with
more than one S&T Institution, that was the case of União Química, Biolab, Geyer, Prati Donaduzzi and
Cristália. Another highlight is the overall importance of the company Cristália in terms of centrality in the
network formation. However, the percentage 23% percentage is higher than the analogous 20% of identified
multinational pharmaceutical companies that established university-industry relationships in Brazil. Also,
Brazilian pharmaceutical companies accounted for 26% of total interactions while multinational companies
engaged only in 16% of total university industry interactions. Thus, based on the empirical evidence, it is
possible to state that Brazilian pharmaceutical companies interact more with Brazilian universities than
multinational pharmaceutical companies do.
The Brazilian pharmaceutical companies’ subgraph, despite having a higher number of nodes (58), present
a relatively lower density (0,031) accompanied by a higher number of weakly connected nodes (10), when
compared to the multinational companies’ subgraph indicators (39; 0.051 and 4, respectively). The average
path length of the Brazilian pharmaceutical companies’ graph (3.929) is also higher than the multinationals’
subgraph (3.883) as the Brazilian companies are connected to a higher number of S&T Institutions (34
versus 22), resulting in a relative lower node proximity.
The public laboratories’ subgraph involved a distinguished specificity concerning the possibility that these
laboratories operate as both National S&T Institutions and productive agents. Even though the effort to
consider only those interactions in which the laboratories were involved as industrial actors, it is quite
difficult to completely isolate university-industry relationships from academic only interactions. The
network presented the highest number of ties (52), reflecting average degree of 2.261 and only 3 weakly
connected nodes that together indicates a great level of proximity between the public laboratories and
Brazilian universities. The proximity may also be inferred from the diminished diameter (6), considered
the elevated number of nodes (46). Most public laboratories were connected to more than one university
and some of them are directly connected to other public laboratories. Many universities were also connected
to more than one public laboratory. The positive and non-null average clustering coefficient (0,095),
corroborates the higher complexity of the network structure. Institutions such as CNEN, UFPR, FUNED,
FIOCRUZ and BUTANTAN proved to be highly important due to their clustering effects.
All subgraphs have been merged into a broader network which represents the university-industry
relationships established within the boundaries of the Brazilian biopharmaceutical innovation system. The
number of ties was exactly the sum of subgraphs’ ties (185), however the number of nodes (164) was lower
than the analogous sum of subgraphs’ nodes (211) reflecting the existence of 47 nodes that were double
counted due to S&T Institutions operating in more than one subgraph. Therefore, the average degree of the
complete graph (2.256) is higher than most subgraphs except for the public laboratories’ (2.261),
corroborating the relative importance of BUTANTAN, FIOCRUZ and FUNED as graph’s main hubs.
The average clustering coefficient (0.026) also highlighted the importance of public laboratories such as
CNEN, FUNED, BUTANTAN, FIOCRUZ, alongside Brazilian pharmaceutical companies Biolab and
Cristália, and some universities like UFPR and USP, due to their clustering effect in the knowledge
network.
The graph’s density (0.014) decreased when all the subgraphs were merged in comparison to each subgraph
previous density. The diameter did not decrease in comparison to bioscience firms’, national and
multinational pharmaceuticals’ subgraphs and the number of weakly connected nodes remained high.
Results indicate the existence of specific patterns that characterize each subgraph that do not perfectly blend
in when the main graph is constructed. Furthermore, there are S&T Institutions that are more specialized
in interacting with specific industrial components.

Table 7 consolidates the subgraphs’ and merged graphs’ main hubs. Some S&T Institutions, such as USP
and UFRJ, were central nodes for many subgraphs. Public Laboratories such as BUTANTAN and
FIOCRUZ also appeared as relevant hubs for the merged graph and many subgraphs, either operating as
productive actors or as Research Institutes. However, some S&T institutions were more likely to establish
interactions within determined subgraphs. That was the case of UFPR for Pubic Laboratories, UFPE and
UFSM for national pharmaceutical companies. Institutions like UNICAMP, UNIFESP, UFMG, UFRGS
and UNB showed strong potential to enhance proximity in the networks and to be more intensive in
university-industry relationships but were still oriented towards more strictly academic activities and
interactions. Regarding relations with foreign knowledge sources, UFRJ, USP and FIOCRUZ worked as
bridges integrating national and international research institutes.

6. Conclusions

This paper provides an initial assessment of the Biopharmaceutical System of Innovation in Brazil, firstly,
by identifying a heterogeneous sample of 385 public and private producers that integrate such system. The
sample was classified according to four different categories: 102 bioscience knowledge intensive
entrepreneurships with applications in human health, 148 Brazilian pharmaceutical companies, 23 public
laboratories and 112 multinational pharmaceutical companies established in Brazil. The sample
identification according to enterprises’ Brazilian National Register of Legal Entities (CNPJ ID numbers)
is a major contribution to academic research for enabling the cross use of several different databases based
on CNPJ codes and by approximating the diverse universe of producers that integrate the
Biopharmaceutical System of Innovation in Brazil.
In doing so, the study also contributes to the academic literature specialized in pharmaceutical studies by
analyzing the importance and nature of the university-industry relationships in crucial areas to the
biopharmaceutical research and, foremost, by highlighting the different patterns of interaction according to
the specifies of each productive base partition. Approximately 27% of the identified sampled engaged in
243 linkages with 63 Brazilian S&T Institutions in health and biological sciences in 2014-2016 period.
Interactions were mostly nurtured in pharmacy (24%), medicine (18%), biochemistry (14%) and
microbiology (9%) knowledge areas. Brazilian public and private laboratories accounted for 84% of total
interactions. The number of Brazilian pharmaceutical companies engaged in university-industry
relationships overlaps both the number and the frequency of multinational pharmaceutical companies
interacting with Brazilian universities and research centers. The result corroborates the theoretical
hypothesis that multinational pharmaceutical companies tend to keep most of their innovative efforts
concentrated in their origin headquarters abroad. While national public and private laboratories interacted
mostly with research groups from pharmacy, biochemistry, genetics and microbiology knowledge areas,
multinational companies were more intensive in relationships in medicine knowledge area. Approximately
58% of university-industry relationships concerned jointly conducted research with or without immediate
application of results. While applied research activities involved mostly national public and private
laboratories, basic research efforts occurred more often among multinational companies and national public
laboratories. The limited frequency of bilateral types of interactions is a major concern identified in the
study.
The social networks approach applied to study university-industry collaborations also contributes to
identifying both S&T Institutions and companies that are central to knowledge networks formation and
organizations that operate as structural bridges or knowledge gate keepers connecting originally
disconnected networks structures. Due to the characteristic of the Biopharmaceutical knowledge-based
activities, the capacity to access directly or indirectly external sources of knowledge – such as universities
and research centers, other enterprises, users, producers, hospitals engaged in clinical trial procedures,
political and regulatory bodies and other System of Innovation components – are considered critical to
firms’ innovative capacity. It is feasible to suppose that the firms currently engaged in relationships with
academia that played central roles in knowledge networks formation are those more likely to have built
internal capabilities, knowledge skills and the ones who have undertaken considerable innovative efforts.
Also, the institutions that are more able to connect with many different types of firms and to operate as
structural bridges are those more likely to support and enhance systemic integration within the
Biopharmaceutical System of Innovation in Brazil. These results hold critical potential implications to
support future technical and normative vertical actions oriented to nurture Biopharmaceutical activities in
Brazil.
The knowledge network analysis indicated that public laboratories, such as FIOCRUZ, BUTANTAN and
FUNED, stand out as bridges and have structural roles connecting originally disconnected nodes while
operating as both industrial and S&T institutions. Other highly central S&T Institutions were USP and
UFRJ. The Brazilian pharmaceutical company Cristália arose as an important hub in the network,
considering both centrality and prestige measurements, indicating significant technological efforts being
undertaken by the firm. The Brazilian bioscience firms Biomm and Biozeus and the multinationals MSD
and GSK were, also, key hubs in their respective subgraphs. Other S&T Institutions – such as CNEN, UFPR
and UFPE – stood out when clustering measurements and specific subgraphs were considered. Highly
relevant universities in the Brazilian S&T context – such as UNICAMP, UNESP, UNIFESP, UFMG,
UFRGS, UNB – could have embraced a more active role in biopharmaceutical university-industry
relationships, though data indicated a bias towards pure academic partnerships.
