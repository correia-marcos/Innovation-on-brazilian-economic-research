Abstract: This paper sought to provide a theoretical motivation for an Expanded Knowledge Production
Function (EKPF) that encompasses both path dependence and spatial spillovers. In addition, search for
evidence from Brazil using a Dynamic Spatial Panel Data approach. The purpose is to identify the
determinants of knowledge production in the country as well as its temporal evolution, using innovation
patents as proxy. Regarding its spatial distribution, we identified a North-South disparity for the knowledge
production in Brazil, with Southeast and South producing a large part of the country's patents. Based on the
EKPF, we confirmed the path dependence and knowledge spillovers importance to explain the Brazilian
innovation. The number of researchers in universities and export of high and mid-high technology products
are also relevant to knowledge production in the country while urbanization and population density, which
generates Jacobin externalities and economies of agglomeration, are important structural features.
Keywords: Knowledge Production Function (KPF); Path Dependence; Spatial Spillover; Dynamic Spatial
Panel.

Resumo: Este artigo objetiva prover uma motivação teórica para uma Função de Produção de
Conhecimento Expandida (FPCE) que incorpore simultaneamente o processo de path-dependence e de
transbordamentos espaciais. Além disso, buscar evidências para o Brasil utilizando um Painel Dinâmico
Espacial. O intuito é identificar os determinantes da produção de conhecimento no país assim como a sua
evolução temporal, tendo as patentes de inovação como proxy. Como corolário, identificou-se uma
disparidade Norte-Sul para produção de conhecimento, com a atividade inovativa se concentrando no
Sudeste e Sul do país. Com base na FPCE, verificou-se a importância do path dependence e dos
transbordamentos espaciais do conhecimento para explicar a inovação brasileira. O número de
pesquisadores em universidades e a exportação de produtos de alta e média tecnologia também são
relevantes para explicar a criação de conhecimento no Brasil enquanto a urbanização e densidade
demográfica, geradoras de externalidades jacobinas e economias de aglomeração, são características
estruturais importantes.

1. Introduction

        The economic development of a country is associated, among other factors, to its ability to generate
scientific and technological knowledge, as they are likely to become innovations, which enable increases
in productivity and competitiveness for the economy. The identification of technological innovation as a
driving force of economic growth dates back to Solow (1956) and the emergence of long-term development
theories. Despite showing its importance, Solow (1956) treated technology as exogenous, not establishing
its possible determinants. Subsequently, Romer (1990) worked this limitation, making technological
innovation an endogenous variable, assuming a key role in the process of long-term economic growth. In
this context, knowledge improves technology, and the generation of a new idea can induce new
                                                                                                                 2




combinations of certain inputs, creating better goods and services, which leads to an increase in material
well-being. Technological progress, by intensifying productivity, is, therefore, an economic growth booster.
        However, the creation of knowledge and innovations often entails high costs and, according to
Romer (1993), since they are non-rival goods, the returns obtained with the invention are usually
insufficient to generate incentives for their development. On the other hand, Douglas North (1981) argues
that the development of intellectual property rights, the legal basis for the patent system, is a major
contributor to modern economic growth. Therefore, the consolidation of institutions that guarantee
intellectual property rights in a given country is an essential condition for their economic development.
        Recognizing the importance of innovation, Brazil created, in 2005, the Brazilian Innovation Law
(Law nº10,973 of 2005). Its main purpose was to establish specific legal guidelines for the licensing of
patents of public entities and to create greater legal certainty in patenting. In other words, it consolidated
the intellectual property rights in the country by allowing security in the appropriation of part of the benefits
generated with the knowledge created. The monopoly power Induced by intellectual property makes it
possible to increase the return on investment in innovations, thus encouraging the generation of knowledge.
        Legal insecurity due to the lack of a clear legislation on the subject, in the period prior to the creation
of the innovation law, Inhibited the strengthening of technological development in the country (STAL and
FUJINO, 2005). This fact explains the relative backwardness of Brazil in terms of knowledge generation.
For these reasons, Law Nº. 13,243, in its Article 1, sought to establish "[...] measures to encourage
innovation and scientific-technological research in the productive environment [...] under the terms of arts.
23, 24, 167, 200, 213, 218, 219 and 219-A of the Federal Constitution. "
        In this context, the present paper aims to contribute in two directions to the literature on
technological development and knowledge creation. The first is a theoretical motivation in explaining the
determinants of knowledge production, with special focus on the process of path dependence and spatial
spillover, based on works developed by Griliches (1979), Jaffe (1989), Fischer et al. (2009) and Autant-
Bernard and LeSage (2011). There is no theoretical explanation in the literature for the simultaneous
occurrence of the two cited effects, which are treated separately by the authors mentioned. The second
contribution is an empirical application of the Dynamic Spatial Panel method developed by Yu et al. (2008),
which is capable of verifying the validity of the theoretical proposition for Brazil.
        The best proxy to capture innovation and knowledge production, according to Griliches (1990) is
the number of patents created by a particular country or region, which has been widely used by researchers
of the subject (GRILICHES, 1990; ALBUQUERQUE et al., 2002; GONÇALVES, 2007; GONÇALVES
and ALMEIDA, 2009; FREITAS et al., 2010; MONTENEGRO et al., 2011; MIRANDA and ZUCOLOTO,
2015; GONÇALVES et al., 2018). This is the case, according to Miranda and Zucoloto (2015), because
patents are an important indicator of the presence of "knowledge with an innovative profile”. Therefore,
when analyzing the number of patents in the microregions, it is possible to infer the contribution of each of
these regions to the production of knowledge in Brazil.
        This article is structured in four more sections besides this one. The second deals with the theoretical
proposition of an Expanded Knowledge Production Function, as well as an investigation in the literature
on the determinants of knowledge production. In the third section, we present the empirical approach and
the database used. The results found and their analysis are performed in the fourth section. Finally, the fifth
section presents the final considerations.

2. An Expanded Knowledge Production Function with Path Dependence and Spatial Spillovers

        The Knowledge Production Function (KPF) was formulated and empirically tested in Griliches
(1979; 1984). Subsequently, Jaffe (1989) expanded the model to apply it to geographic units, increasing
the scope of knowledge production analysis. Since then, several papers have applied the KPF to understand
the determinants of the innovative process (ANSELIN et al., 1997; GONÇALVES and ALMEIDA, 2009;
MONTENEGRO et al., 2011). The model proposed by Griliches (1979) are defined as
                                              𝑌 = 𝐹(𝑋, 𝐾, 𝑢)                                                   (1)
                                                                                                               3




where 𝐹( ) is the production function that relates the product, 𝑌, to the inputs 𝑋, 𝐾 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑢; 𝑋 is a vector of
the capital and labor inputs. 𝐾 is a measure of the current state of scientific and technological knowledge,
which to a certain extent is determined by the level of recent and past research and development (R&D); 𝑢
captures all other factors that influence the level of productivity and production of knowledge. Then, let
𝐴 = 𝑌/𝑋 be the total factor productivity and 𝜏 = 𝑦 − 𝑥 = (𝑑𝑌⁄𝑑𝑡)⁄𝑌 − (𝑑𝑋⁄𝑑𝑡)⁄𝑋 the growth rate.
        Griliches (1979) supports the basic hypothesis that there is a relation between the scientific and
technological development level, 𝐾, and an index that captures recent and past levels of R&D investment,
denoted by 𝑊(𝐵)𝑅. The 𝑊(𝐵) is a polynomial lag, that describes the relative contribution of past and
future research to the current level of 𝐾, with 𝐵 being a lag operator. Therefore, 𝐾 is
                                                𝐾 = 𝐺[𝑊(𝐵)𝑅, 𝑣]                                              (2)
and
                   𝑊(𝐵)𝑅𝑡 = (𝑤𝑜 + 𝑤1 𝐵 + 𝑤2 𝐵 2 + ⋯ )𝑅𝑡 = 𝑤𝑜 𝑅𝑡 + 𝑤1 𝑅𝑡−1 + 𝑤2 𝑅𝑡−2 + . ..                   (3)
where 𝑣 is a parameter that captures influences on the level of accumulated knowledge. Griliches (1979)
seeks to define 𝐹( ) through the Cobb-Douglas functional form while assuming that 𝑢 can be considered
as random after the introduction of a time indicator 𝑡 in the equation in order to represent other
immeasurable systematic components that can influence 𝑌. Therefore, 𝐹( ) are
                                                𝑌 = 𝐷𝐶 𝛼 𝐿𝛽 𝐾 𝛾 𝑒 𝜆𝑡+𝑢                                       (4)
where 𝐷 is a constant; 𝐶 and 𝐿 are capital and labor respectively; 𝑡 is a time indicator; 𝑒 is the basis of the
natural logarithm; and 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾 are the parameters to be estimated empirically.
        In a later formulation, Griliches (1984) uses the number of patents created as an indicator of
knowledge production. The author defined in a reduced form the patenting model as
                                                𝑝𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽𝑘̇𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑣𝑖,𝑡                                    (5)
in which 𝛽 is the elasticity of patents in relation to an increase of knowledge; 𝑑 is a measure of temporal
tendency with respect to the determinant factors in the propensity to create patents; 𝑣 is the part of the
patents that cannot be explained by the increment of knowledge or temporal tendency.
        In a theoretical advance, Jaffe (1989) modified the model proposed by Griliches (1979; 1984) in an
attempt to capture effects of spillovers in knowledge creation. The modification defined by Jaffe (1989) is
                    log(𝑃𝑖𝑘𝑡 ) = 𝛽1𝑘 log(𝐼𝑖𝑘𝑡 ) + 𝛽2𝑘 log(𝑈𝑖𝑘𝑡 ) + 𝛽3𝑘 [log(𝑈𝑖𝑘𝑡 ) log(𝐶𝑖𝑘𝑡 )] + 𝜖𝑖𝑘𝑡        (6)
𝑖 refers to the observation unit (municipalities, microregions, states); 𝑘 is the technological area; 𝑡 is a time
index; 𝑃 is the number of patents; 𝐼 is the R&D carried out by the industries; 𝑈 is the R&D undertaken by
universities. Lastly, 𝐶 is a geographic measure that seeks to capture the coincidence between activities of
university and industrial research, variable introduced in the purpose of capturing possible spillovers that
impact on the creation of patents.
         Fischer et al. (2009), on the other hand, explicitly incorporated the regional perspective, into the
knowledge production function. The author defined KPF as
                                                 𝑄𝑖𝑡 = 𝐴𝑖𝑡 𝑔(𝐿𝑖𝑡 , 𝐶𝑖𝑡 )                                     (7)
where 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁 are the regions; while 𝑡 = 1, … , 𝑇 is a time denotation; 𝐿 and 𝐶 are the factors of
production, labor and capital, respectively. 𝑔 ( … ) is a homogeneous function of degree one with
decreasing returns of scale for capital inputs (𝐶) and labor (𝐿). Lastly, 𝑄 is the value of production and 𝐴
is an index of technological efficiency defined as
                                                    𝐴𝑖𝑡 = 𝐴(𝐾𝑖𝑡 , 𝐾𝑖𝑡∗ )                                     (8)
𝐾 and 𝐾 ∗ are the knowledge stocks inside and outside the region, respectively. Fischer et al. (2009) argues
that even when the patenting occurs, there is the possibility of a portion of that knowledge be appropriate
by the agents located in neighboring regions. According to the author, this process is given through personal
                                                                                                                         4




contacts, seminars and scientific conferences, legal transfers, reverse engineering, etc. Therefore, in a
country with 𝑁-regions, the global stock of knowledge is
                                                               𝑁

                                                               ∑ 𝐾𝑗𝑡                                                   (9)
                                                               𝑗=1

𝑗 denote the 𝑗-th region and assumes that the level of knowledge 𝐾𝑗𝑡 is accumulated through activities
specified in the Knowledge Production Function, as well as depreciates each period at a pace 𝑟𝑘 . Therefore,
Fischer et al. (2009) establishes a law of movement for the stock of knowledge
                                                                                              𝑆𝑗𝑡−1
                                 𝐾𝑗𝑡 = (1 − 𝑟𝑘 )𝐾𝑗𝑡−1 + 𝑆𝑗𝑡−1 = 𝐾𝑗𝑡−1 (1 − 𝑟𝑘 +                     )                (10)
                                                                                              𝐾𝑗𝑡−1
this law implies that the activities carried out to produce knowledge in 𝑡 − 1, 𝑆𝑗𝑡−1 , only become productive
in the period 𝑡, in other words, there are a path dependence in the production of knowledge.
        Fischer et al. (2009) argues that due to the occurrence of knowledge spillover in neighboring
regions, the variable 𝐾𝑖𝑡∗ should be defined taking into account this non-complete appropriation, as follows
                                                                𝑁

                                                      𝐾𝑖𝑡∗   = ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑗 𝐾𝑗𝑡−𝑚                                           (11)
                                                               𝑗 ≠𝑖

where 𝑤𝑖𝑗 represents the capacity of the region 𝑖 in absorb the knowledge generated in the region 𝑗, which
is defined according to some criterion of neighborhood or geographical distance; 𝐾𝑗𝑡−𝑚 is the stock of
knowledge in the region 𝑗 in the period 𝑡 − 𝑚 with 𝑚 ∈ ℕ. The author defends the need to include the time
lag of the knowledge spillovers of the neighboring regions because its effects often do not occur in the same
period. Therefore, the spillover effect must be temporally and spatially lagged. The author considers the
Cobb-Douglas functional form for the KPF, replacing equation (8) in (7), for each region 𝑖, as
                                                                       𝛾    ∗𝛾
                                  𝑄𝑖𝑡 = 𝑄(𝐾𝑖𝑡 , 𝐾𝑖𝑡∗ , 𝐿𝑖𝑡 , 𝐶𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝐾𝑖𝑡1 𝐾𝑖𝑡 2 𝐿𝛼𝑖𝑡 𝐶𝑖𝑡1−𝛼 exp(𝜀𝑖𝑡 )                (12)
in which 𝛾1, 𝛾2, 𝛼, 1 − 𝛼 are the elasticities of knowledge production in relation to the internal knowledge
stock of region 𝑖, as well as external stock, labor and capital, respectively.
       Autant-Bernard and LeSage (2011), in turn, developed a theoretical model for KPF that incorporates
not only the knowledge spillover generated in a given region, but also the externality of its own inputs and
determinants. In general, the authors defined the equation relating such factors as
                                                      𝑰 = 𝛼1 𝒓 + 𝒓∗                                                  (13)
where 𝑰 represents a (logarithmic) vector of observations from innovations performed by the 𝑛 regions
considered; 𝒓 is a vector representing the measurable inputs of the production of knowledge; 𝒓∗ are
important inputs to explain the innovative process, but that are difficult to measure. Considering that the
spatial dependence process in the generation of knowledge is something recurrent in the literature 1, the
authors sought to incorporate this dependency explicitly, as follows
                                  𝒓 = 𝜙𝑾𝒓 + 𝒖 ,         𝒓∗ = 𝜓𝑾𝒓∗ + 𝒗            𝑎𝑛𝑑      𝒗 = 𝒖𝛾 + 𝜀                 (14)
so that, 𝑾 is a 𝑛 𝑥 𝑛 spatial lag matrix that seeks to capture the structural configuration between the regions;
𝜙 and 𝜓 are parameters that capture the force of spatial dependence of variables 𝒓 and 𝒓∗ , respectively; 𝛾
reflects a Pearson correlation between the shocks of 𝒖 and 𝒗 in relation to measurable and immeasurable
inputs of production when 𝛾 ≠ 0. In addition, the errors have constant variance and zero mean
                              𝒖~𝑁(𝟎, 𝜎𝑢2 𝑰𝒏 ),        𝒗~𝑁(𝟎, 𝜎𝑣2 𝑰𝒏 )       𝑎𝑛𝑑       𝜀~𝑁(𝟎, 𝜎𝜀2 𝑰𝒏 )               (15)

 For example: Autant-Bernard (2001), Autant-Bernard et al. (2007), Parent and LeSage (2008). For Brazil, spatial dependence
has also been a recurrent process: Gonçalves (2007), Gonçalves and Almeida (2009), Montenegro et al. (2011), Araújo (2013).

Finally, Autant-Bernard and LeSage (2011) considering (9), (10) and (11), proposes the following relation
                                      𝑰 = 𝜓𝑾𝑰 + 𝒓(𝛽 + 𝛾) + 𝑾𝒓(−𝜓𝛽 − 𝜙𝛾) + 𝜀                             (16)
or
             𝑰 = 𝜓𝑾𝑰 + 𝒓𝛽1 + 𝑾𝒓𝛽2 + 𝜀, 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝛽1 = (𝛽 + 𝛾) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛽2 = (−𝜓𝛽 − 𝜙𝛾)                           (17)
equation (16) and (17) represent the Spatial Durbin Model by Anselin (1988). Therefore, Autant-Bernard
and LeSage (2011) developed a theoretical motivation for the incorporation of spatial lag both for the
dependent variable (𝑾𝑰) and for the explanatory variables (𝑾𝒓).
        Based on the works mentioned, the present paper seeks to contribute theoretically to the
understanding of the production of knowledge, proposing a model that combines the approaches, especially
Fischer et al. (2009) and Autant-Bernard and LeSage (2011). We initially propose the following equation
that relates the knowledge produced by a given region according to the inputs needed to generate it, as
                                               𝐾𝑖𝑡 = 𝑓(𝐿𝑖𝑡 , 𝐶𝑖𝑡 , 𝑟𝑖𝑡 )                                (18)
where the regions are denoted by 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁 ∈ 𝑅 ⊂ ℕ, in which 𝑅 is a natural well-order and upper
bounded set of the regions; while 𝑡 = 1, … , 𝑇 refers to the time period; 𝐿 and 𝐶 is the stock of labor and
capital employed in knowledge production, respectively; and 𝑟𝑖𝑡 are the other factors not explicitly
considered that influence the creation of knowledge in the region 𝑖 in period 𝑡. In addition, 𝑓: 𝐾𝑖𝑡 ⟶ ℕ
is a homogeneous function of degree one with decreasing returns of scale to capital (𝐶) and labor (𝐿):
𝜕 2 𝐾𝑖𝑡 ⁄𝜕𝐶𝑖𝑡2 < 0 and 𝜕 2 𝐾𝑖𝑡 ⁄𝜕𝐿2𝑖𝑡 < 0, respectively. Lastly, 𝐾𝑖𝑡 is the amount of knowledge produced by
the region 𝑖 in period 𝑡. Assuming that 𝑓: 𝐾𝑖𝑡 ⟶ ℕ is a Cobb-Douglas functional form, as in Fischer et
al. (2009), we have
                                                                𝛽    𝛽     𝛽
                                  𝐾𝑖𝑡 = 𝑓(𝐿𝑖𝑡 , 𝐶𝑖𝑡 , 𝑟𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝐿𝑖𝑡1 𝐶𝑖𝑡2 𝑟𝑖𝑡 3 exp(𝜀𝑖𝑡 )                 (19)
where 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 and 𝛽3 are the elasticities of knowledge production in relation to the labor, capital and other
factors that influence the creation of knowledge, respectively; all for region 𝑖 in period 𝑡. Making a
transformation in (19) based on that realized by Jaffe (1989), we get
                          log(𝐾𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝛽1 log(𝐶𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝛽2 log(𝐿𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝛽3 log(𝑟𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜖𝑖𝑘𝑡                 (20)
Which the present paper adopt the approach used by Autant-Bernard and LeSage (2011). Therefore, the
spillovers are captured with a spatial lag matrix, 𝑾, 𝑛 𝑥 𝑛 which represents the structural configuration
between the regions. Considering, for simplification, the inputs in (20) as a vector 𝑰 = [𝛽1 log(𝐶𝑖𝑡 ) +
𝛽2 log(𝐿𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝛽3 log(𝑟𝑖𝑡 )], we can represent the equation (20) with the knowledge spillovers as
                                  log(𝐾𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝜌𝑾 log(𝐾𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝑰𝛽 + 𝑾𝑰𝜏 + 𝜖𝑖𝑘𝑡                        (21)
where 𝜌 and 𝜏 are parameters that capture the force of spatial dependence of variables log(𝐾𝑖𝑡 ) and the
input vector 𝑰, respectively. This formulation results, as in Autant-Bernard and LeSage (2011), in the
Spatial Durbin Model, as in Anselin (1988).
        However, this theoretical formulation, despite being effective to evidence the existence of spillovers
in the production of knowledge, as well as in the inputs used, is not able to capture the intertemporal
relationship proposed by Fischer et al. (2009). This author states that not only the generation of knowledge
in 𝑡 creates spillovers on neighboring regions, but also those generated in the previous period, 𝑡 − 1.
Moreover, considering equation (10) and (11), the knowledge generated by the region 𝑖 in 𝑡 − 1 not only
affect the neighboring regions 𝑗 in 𝑡, but also the region 𝑖 that created it. Thus, the present paper proposes
a theoretical model that incorporates both the spillovers effects proposed by Autant-Bernard and LeSage
(2011), as well as the path dependence and intertemporal spillover from Fischer et al. (2009). Thus, such
a model can be represented as
                log(𝐾𝑖𝑡 ) = γlog(𝐾𝑖𝑡−1 ) + 𝜌𝑾 log(𝐾𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝜔𝑾 log(𝐾𝑖𝑡−1 ) + 𝑰𝛽 + 𝑾𝑰𝜏 + 𝜖𝑖𝑘𝑡              (22)
where log(𝐾𝑖𝑡−1 ) represents the time lag of the dependent variable that seeks to capture temporal
dependence, the influence of knowledge production in the region 𝑖 in 𝑡 − 1, in itself in a later period 𝑡.

𝑾 log(𝐾𝑖𝑡−1 ) seeks to capture the spillover of knowledge production in 𝑡 − 1 from region 𝑖 on the creation
in 𝑡 of its neighbors 𝑗, according to a spatial configuration matrix represented by 𝑾; γ is the coefficient
that captures the force of path dependence on knowledge production in the region 𝑖 while 𝜌 and 𝜔 are
coefficients that capture the space-time spillover between regions.

2.1 Determinants of Knowledge Production

        Here, we seek to identify in the literature the main determinants of knowledge production and
innovation. The main purpose is to identify the variables that can represent the vector 𝑰 = [𝛽1 log(𝐶𝑖𝑡 ) +
𝛽2 log(𝐿𝑖𝑡 ) + 𝛽3 log(𝑟𝑖𝑡 )] that is, labor, capital and other positive influences in knowledge production.
        Lucas (1988) and Romer (1990), in the endogenous growth theory, have shown that innovation is
among the "deep" causes of economic progress. This is due the existence of positive externalities of
knowledge; and its generation occurs mainly through expenditures on Research and Development (R&D),
whether public or private. According to Cassiolato (1999), innovation and the development of new
technologies do not occur in isolation in the intra-firm environment, since the institutions of the countries
and regions in which the company is inserted are fundamental. Freeman (1988) emphasizes the importance
of articulation between the educational system and the productive sector in the generation of knowledge,
especially universities that supply skilled labor to firms, besides the realization of basic and applied
research, which can be transformed into technological developments, raising the productivity and
competitiveness of the firms. In this context, Freeman (1988) and Nelson (1996) argues that internal R&D
performed in private companies, combined with those spent in universities and research institutes are key
elements in the production of knowledge.
        The production of knowledge and innovation, however, does not take place in an isolated and
independent way, since reflects attitudes and paths taken previously in a historical construction (NELSON,
1996). According to Arthur (1989), technological development tends to assume a pre-established trajectory,
a relation called path-dependence. Hence, the amount of innovation created in the 𝑡 − 1 is an important
determinant of knowledge produced in the current period 𝑡. Ejermo (2005) emphasizes the need to include
the temporally lagged dependent variable in the knowledge production function. Otherwise, the
econometric model may suffer from omission of relevant variable, invalidating the statistical inferences,
although the author did not address it in a theoretical perspective. Therefore, we can infer that initial
advantages help to determine the future development of knowledge production, causing, in the long run,
inequalities between regions. In the context of the present paper, such a path-dependence relationship was
formally incorporated in the Knowledge Production Function with the term 𝐾𝑖𝑡−1.
        In addition, Krugman (1991) argues that scientific and technological knowledge, as a source of
increasing returns to scale, can unleash attractive forces for similar activities, resulting in a process of
agglomeration or geographical concentration. Thus, location is an important factor in explaining the
differences in economic growth rate, as well as in the process of development and dissemination of
innovation. In other words, there is a need to incorporate spatial and geographic location in regional
analyzes, especially those related to inventive activities related to scientific and technological knowledge
in order to avoid mistaken or incomplete conclusions.
        Jacobs (1969) supports the importance of agglomeration and geographic proximity, which make it
possible to increase the diffusion, transmission and exchange of knowledge. This phenomenon, in most
cases, is linked to the urbanization, which leads to the concentration of economic activities known as
agglomeration economies. From this perspective, Griliches (1992) emphasizes the importance of
knowledge spillovers related to geographical concentration and urbanization, which result from positive
externalities inherent to the innovative process. These spillovers, according to the author, only occur when
there is geographic proximity, and can induce the increase of the spatial concentration of this activity.
        Considering Brazil, according to Albuquerque (1996) and Villaschi (2005), Brazil presents an
inadequate infrastructure for scientific and technological development, as well as a low interaction of the
agents. In relation to the analysis of the spatial distribution of the innovative activity in the country,
                                                                                                             7




Gonçalves (2007) identified the existence of spatial autocorrelation in the production of knowledge, with
regions with high level of technological activity having neighbors with similar characteristics. In addition,
the author found a North-South spatial pattern for the Brazilian innovation distribution, with the southeast
and south regions being characterized as having high technological activity while the Northeast, North and
Central West regions with low.
        Freitas et al. (2010) sought to investigate the inequality between Brazilian states from 1990 to 2001
and also found evidence of spatial concentration of the Brazilian innovation, with the existence of
significant spatial clusters of inventive activity in the country, especially in the Southeast and South. They
also identified evidence of a convergence process between Brazilian states, that is, regions less developed
presenting a higher growth rate than more consolidated regions. Similar results were obtained by Oliveira
et al. (2016) and Rodriguez and Gonçalves (2017) that also identified a spatial concentration of the
innovative activity in Brazil, indicating the importance of the spatial component, besides the occurrence of
a catching up process between the regions.
        Gonçalves and Almeida (2009), in turn, estimate a Knowledge Production Function for the Brazilian
microregions for the year 2000 with a Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR). The authors found that
knowledge spillover is an important determinant of Brazilian innovation. In addition, factors such as R&D
performed by universities and companies, demographic density (urban scale) and industrial infrastructure
were important for determining the knowledge generated in Brazil. Also for the microregions in Brazil,
Araújo (2013) estimated a KPF using the SAR-Tobit method. The author found that higher levels of
regional industrial R&D and academic research imply greater innovation measured by patents. Moreover,
denser and diverse cities tend to present a better innovative performance what indicates Jacobian advantages
for regional innovation in Brazil. Finally, the author highlights the importance of interregional knowledge
spillovers associated to innovative activities.
        Montenegro et al. (2011) and Gonçalves et al. (2018) are the only papers in the literature to seek to
estimate a KPF through a Dynamic Panel, in order to verify the importance of path dependence for Brazil.
However, the authors used the Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimator, different from the one
employed in this paper, and did not considered possible impacts from spillover of knowledge production
in 𝑡 − 1 in neighbors regions. Considering the geographic and temporal cut, Montenegro et al. (2011) did
the research only for the microregions of São Paulo in the 1996-2003 period while Gonçalves et al. (2018)
considered all microregions in Brazil in the 2000-2011 period. Both authors confirmed the importance of
path dependence for the production of knowledge in the country. In addition, Gonçalves et al. (2018) found
evidences of knowledge spatial spillovers that reinforce the path-dependence process.

3. Methodology
3.1 Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)

      The ESDA capture effects of spatial dependence and heterogeneity, association patterns (spatial
clusters) and indicate how the data are distributed. The Moran’s I statistics seeks to capture the degree of
spatial correlation between a variable across regions. Mathematically,
                                                   𝑛 ∑𝑖 ∑𝑗 𝑤𝑖𝑗 𝑧𝑖 𝑧𝑗
                                              𝐼=                                                         (23)

where 𝑛 is the number of regions, 𝑆0 is a value equal to the sum of all elements of matrix 𝑊, 𝑧 is the
normalized value for deforestation. However, the Moran's I statistic only capture global autocorrelation,
not identifying association at a local level. In this context, we use the LISA (statistic, which are capable to
capture local spatial autocorrelation and clusters,
                                                     𝐽

                                           𝐼𝑖 = 𝑧𝑖 ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑗 𝑧𝑗                                              (24)
                                                   𝑗−1

where 𝑧𝑖 represents the variable of interest of the standardized region i, 𝑤𝑖𝑗 is the spatial weighting matrix
element (W) and 𝑧𝑗 is the value of the variable of interest in the standardized region 𝑗. The local Moran I
(LISA) can represent four spatial clusters: High-High (AA), Low-Low (BB), High-Low (AB) and Low-
High (BA). The most analyzed is the High-High cluster, which indicates that a region with a high value for
the analyzed variable is surrounded by regions with similar values.

3.2 Dynamic Spatial Panel

        The Dynamic Spatial Panel Model, besides incorporating the spatial lag of the dependent variable,
also incorporates a temporal dependent variable. In addition, it is possible to incorporate a space-time lag
of the dependent variable. Therefore, it is a methodology capable of empirically grasping the theoretical
model proposed in this article. The estimation of such a model will follow the approach proposed by Yu et
al. (2008). The general specification are
               𝑌𝑛𝑡 = 𝜆0 𝑊𝑛 𝑌𝑛𝑡 + 𝛾0 𝑌𝑛𝑡−1 + 𝜌0 𝑊𝑛 𝑌𝑛𝑡−1 + 𝑋𝑛𝑡 𝛽0 + 𝒄𝑛0 + 𝑉𝑛𝑡 ,                 𝑡 = 1,2, … , 𝑇            (25)
where 𝑌𝑛𝑡 = (𝑌1𝑡 , 𝑌2𝑡 , … , 𝑌𝑛𝑡 )′ and 𝑉𝑛𝑡 = (𝑉1𝑡 , 𝑉2𝑡 , … , 𝑉𝑛𝑡 )′ are column vectors with dimension 𝑛 × 1, 𝑉𝑛𝑡
is 𝑖. 𝑖. 𝑑 with 𝑖 and 𝑡 with mean zero and variance 𝜎²0; 𝑊𝑛 is a spatial weight matrix 𝑛 × 𝑛 that captures
the spatial dependence between the cross-section variables 𝑦𝑖𝑡 ; 𝑋𝑛𝑡 is a matrix 𝑛 × 𝑘𝑥 of non-stochastic
regressors; and 𝒄𝑛0 is a column vector 𝑛 × 1 of fixed effects. Therefore, the number of parameters in the
model will be equal to the number of individuals 𝑛 plus the other common parameters to be estimated,
(𝛾, 𝜌, 𝛽 ′ , 𝜆, 𝜎²), ie, 𝑘𝑥 + 4.
          Denoting 𝑆𝑛 ≡ 𝑆𝑛 (𝜆0 ) = 𝐼𝑛 − 𝜆0 𝑊𝑛 and 𝐴𝑛 = 𝑆𝑛−1 (𝛾0 𝐼𝑛 + 𝜌0 𝑊𝑛 ), where 𝑆𝑛 is invertible, (25) can
be rewritten as 𝑌𝑛𝑡 = 𝐴𝑛 𝑌𝑛𝑡−1 + 𝑆𝑛−1 𝑋𝑛𝑡 𝛽0 + 𝑆𝑛−1 𝒄𝑛0 + 𝑆𝑛−1 𝑉𝑛𝑡 . Assuming that infinite sums, by
continuous substitution, are well defined, we have
                                        ∞
                               𝑌𝑛𝑡 = ∑ 𝐴ℎ𝑛 𝑆𝑛−1 (𝒄𝑛0 + 𝑋𝑛,𝑡−ℎ + 𝑉𝑛,𝑡−ℎ ) = 𝜇𝑛 + 𝔛𝑛𝑡 𝛽0 + 𝑈𝑛𝑡                             (26)
                                       ℎ=0

In which 𝜇𝑛 = ∑∞            ℎ −1                  ∞    ℎ −1                          ∞    ℎ −1
                       ℎ=0 𝐴𝑛 𝑆𝑛 𝒄𝑛0 , 𝔛𝑛𝑡 = ∑ℎ=0 𝐴𝑛 𝑆𝑛 𝑋𝑛,𝑡−ℎ and 𝑈𝑛𝑡 = ∑ℎ=0 𝐴𝑛 𝑆𝑛 𝑉𝑛,𝑡−ℎ . The next step is
to define the maximum likelihood function that should be maximized. For this, it we denoted 𝜃 =
(𝛿 ′ , 𝜆, 𝜎 2 )′ and 𝜁 = (𝛿 ′ , 𝜆, 𝒄′𝑛 )′, where 𝛿 = (𝛾, 𝜌, 𝛽 ′ )′, being the true value 𝜃0 = (𝛿 ′ 0 , 𝜆0 , 𝜎 2 0 ) and 𝜁0 =
(𝛿 ′ 0 , 𝜆0 , 𝒄′𝑛0 ), which results in the following maximum likelihood function:
                                                                                           𝑇
                                     𝑛𝑇         𝑛𝑇                          1
               ln 𝐿𝑛,𝑇 ( 𝜃, 𝒄𝑛 ) = −    ln 2𝜋 −    ln 𝜎 2 + 𝑇 ln|𝑆𝑛 (𝜆)| −      ∑ 𝑉 ′ 𝑛𝑡 (𝜁) 𝑉𝑛𝑡 (𝜁)                     (27)
                                      2          2                         2𝜎 2
                                                                                         𝑡=1

 where 𝑉𝑛𝑡 (𝜁) = 𝑆𝑛 𝑌𝑛𝑡 − 𝛾0 𝑌𝑛𝑡−1 − 𝜌0 𝑊𝑛 𝑌𝑛𝑡−1 − 𝑋𝑛𝑡 𝛽0 − 𝒄𝑛 , ie, 𝑉𝑛𝑡 = 𝑉𝑛𝑡 (𝜁). If 𝑉𝑛𝑡 is normally
distributed, we will have the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) 𝜃̂𝑛𝑇 and 𝒄̂𝑛𝑇 , derived from the
maximization of (27). In the other hand, if 𝑉𝑛𝑡 is not normally distributed, we have the quasi-maximum
likelihood estimators (QMLEs).
        However, a problem with equation (27) is that the number of parameters tends to infinity as 𝑛 tends
to infinity. Therefore, Yu et al. (2008) proposes a concentrated function of maximum likelihood,
concentrating 𝒄𝑛 out, focusing the asymptotic analysis only in the estimator 𝜃0 by the concentrated function,
since it does not change the parameter size when 𝑛 and/or 𝑇 change. With the purpose of simplification,
the author denoted 𝑌̃𝑛𝑡 = 𝑌𝑛𝑡 − 𝑌̅𝑛𝑇 and 𝑌̃𝑛𝑡−1 = 𝑌𝑛𝑡−1 − 𝑌̅𝑛𝑇−1 , for 𝑡 = 1,2, … , 𝑇 ∈ ℕ where 𝑌̅𝑛𝑇 =
 1 𝑇                      1
   ∑ 𝑌 and 𝑌̅𝑛,𝑇−1 = ∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝑌𝑛,𝑡−1 . Similarly, 𝑋̃𝑛𝑡 = 𝑋𝑛𝑡 − 𝑋̅𝑛𝑇 and 𝑉̃𝑛𝑡 = 𝑉𝑛𝑡 − 𝑉̅𝑛𝑇 ; denoting 𝑍𝑛𝑡 =
 𝑇 𝑡=1 𝑛𝑡                 𝑇
                                                                                                            𝜕 ln 𝐿𝑛,𝑇 (𝜃,𝒄𝑛 )
(𝑌𝑛𝑡−1 , 𝑊𝑛 𝑌𝑛𝑡−1 , 𝑋𝑛𝑡 ), therefore the equation (27), using the first order condition                                         =

3.3 Database

        The variable used as proxy for knowledge production is the number of innovation patents created
in the 558 microregions of Brazil, based on Griliches (1992). Patent deposit data were acquired in the
Statistical Database of Intellectual Property, generated by INPI (Instituto Nacional de Propriedade
Intelectual). Information on Brazilian inventors' deposits is considered according to their region of
residence. With regard to the population of the microregions, the data is from the Instituto Brasileiro de
Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). With this database, an indicator of innovation patents per 100,000
inhabitants are constructed for the country's microregions,

        The choice of variables are based on works already mentioned in this article, especially those who
sought to investigate innovation in the Brazilian context. In any case, some variables need further
explanation. For example, there is no data available in relation to private R&D; therefore, the proportion of
professionals employed in technical and scientific activities in the microregion was used as proxy,
following recommendations of Araújo, Cavalcante e Alves (2009)2. According to Freitas et al. (2010) and
Montenegro et al. (2011), this variable is a suitable proxy, due to the high correlation between them, being
therefore the best variable to represent private R&D, given the lack of data in Brazil.
        On the other hand, the Employment Density and Population Density seeks to capture economies of
agglomeration and Jacobian externalities. According to Jacobs (1969), the concentration and geographical
proximity of individuals makes possible an increase in the diffusion, transmission and exchange of ideas
and information, both in their tacit and codified form, resulting in the amplification of knowledge
production. This phenomenon, for the most part, is linked to the urbanization of a certain locality, a result
of the concentration of economic activities. In addition, several papers empirically corroborate the
importance of agglomeration economics and Jacobian externalities for the innovative process.
(GONÇALVES and ALMEIDA, 2009; FELDMAN and AUDRETSCH, 1999; HARRISON et al., 1996;
GLAESER et al, 1992).
        However, according to Jacobs (1969), the excessive increase in population density may lead to
agglomeration diseconomies, resulting in negative externalities. Therefore, Population Density may have a
non-linear relationship with innovation. Such a fact can be captured with the inclusion of a term in the
linear form and another in the quadratic form in KPF. If the linear is positive and the quadratic is negative,
both significant, we have the presence of agglomeration diseconomies, acting together with the positive
externalities. The overlapping of the two effects will depend on the magnitude of the population density,
with negative externalities standing out in densely populated areas. In fact, Gonçalves and Almeida (2009)
identified this phenomenon as important for the production of knowledge in Brazil.
        The Export variable, in turn, capture the exports of high and mid-high technology intensities
products, which were aggregated following Raiher et al. (2017). In the high intensity products, we have the
aerospace, pharmaceutical, computational, electronic and telecommunications sectors. On the other hand,
in the mid-high intensity products, we have the electrical material; automotive vehicles; chemistry; railroad
and transportation equipment; machinery and equipment. High and mid-high intensity sectors are both

intensive in capital and technology, which can influence the innovation process and in the creation of
knowledge, both directly and indirectly, through spillovers.
        Finally, we also check for possible correlations between the variables (Appendix A) in order to
avoid multicollinearity problems. From them, we can notice no extremely high correlations that could
compromise the model estimation.

4. Spatial Distribution of Knowledge Production and its Determinants in Brazil

        Innovation and technological development have important repercussions on the economic structure
of a country, because it creates and makes new combinations of factors of production, generating alternative
productive processes, with greater productivity, and / or new goods. Therefore, different authors defend the
production of knowledge as the foundation for the economic dynamics of a space. A preliminary descriptive
analysis of the data are performed, in relation to creation of patents by the microregions, in order to verify
the dynamics presented by this production in Brazil (see Figure 1).

         For 2004, the country presented 3740 innovation patents, while in 2016 this number rose to 5193,
an increase of approximately 38.85%. However, such growth does not occur homogeneously throughout
the country. When considering regional levels, for example, a small number of microregions are responsible
for most knowledge produced (patents) in the period 2004 to 2014. It is also evident the concentration of
this innovative process in the country, located mainly in the Center-South portion of the country, which
was called by Gonçalves (2007) and Araújo (2013), a North-South polarization regime. When comparing
the initial period (a) versus the final (b), the production of patents per 100,000 inhabitants maintained the
same spatial distribution and concentration of the amount of knowledge produced. Therefore, it is evident

the existence of an inertial process in the creation of patents, which indicates the possible existence of path
dependence for the production of knowledge in Brazil.
        In addition, the spatial concentration of microregions in relation to patents deposited in both periods
is visible (Figure 1). This is proved by the Moran’s I coefficients in Table 2, whose values were positive
and statistically significant independent of the weight matrix applied. Thus, microregions with a high
number of patents per 100,000 inhabitants tended to be surrounded by microregions with also high values
for this variable. In addition, there is a fall in the magnitude of the coefficients, signaling a decrease of
spatial concentration in the period.

        By using the local spatial association indicators (Lisa maps), the existence of innovation clusters
throughout Brazil was identified. Between the periods, there is the consolidation of two High-High (HH)
clusters (Figure 2), which represents microregions with high innovation surrounded by neighbors with equal
innovative productivity.

        The first HH cluster is located in the state of São Paulo and is configured as the largest spatial HH
cluster due to the number of microregions and the territorial extent of the spatial agglomeration. This
polygon of high technological activity, in period one (a), extends from São Paulo and closer neighbors such
as Guarulhos, Osasco and Santos, passing by Campinas, Piracicaba, São Carlos, Araraquara, Ribeirão Preto,
to the north and northwest of the state, in Franca, Barretos and São José do Rio Preto. According to
Montenegro et al. (2011), the high technological development of the region is because it has a diversified
industrial base, as well as specialized sectors that encourage innovation.
                                                                                                             13




         However, in the second period (b), some microregions in the north and northwest were no longer
significant, thus making this cluster of high technological activity more concentrated closer to microregions
such as São Paulo and Campinas. According to Fernandes et al. (2016), the technology-based companies
in the state of São Paulo suffered from the country's economic crisis, which possibly impacted on their
respective innovative capabilities. Finally, this HH cluster of high technological activity coincides in
general with that found by the Gonçalves (2007), Montenegro and Betarelli Júnior (2009), Montenegro et
al. (2011), Araújo (2013) and Góis Sobrinho and Azzoni (2016).
         The second HH spatial cluster, in the first period (a), is located mainly in the eastern portion of the
state of Santa Catarina (SC) and Rio Grande do Sul (RS). In SC, two local groups of the HH type, both on
the coast of the state, stand out. Joinville, Blumenau and Itajaí compose one of them while the second
agglomeration refers to the microregions of Florianópolis, Tubarão and Criciúma. These regions are
characterized in the information technology sector and in industrial activities in the area of mechanics and
electrical. In addition, the proximity of these localities may indicate the presence of technological spillovers
between the microregions, impelling the production of knowledge. In the second period (b), the number of
micro of type HH was widened in the state, consolidating the spatial cluster of the region. The SC cluster
starts at the border with RS, passing through the entire regional coast of SC, to the northeast region of
Curitiba in Paraná, the latter being an important industrial complex of the south of Brazil, especially with
regard to its automotive complex (GONÇALVES, 2007; GÓIS SOBRINHO and AZZONI, 2016).
         The state of Rio Grande do Sul, in turn, presents most of the southern cluster in both periods
considered. Moreover, from 2005 to 2015, there was an enlargement of this agglomeration, extending from
the region of Porto Alegre, Caxias do Sul to Passo Fundo, also including adjacent regions such as Gramado,
Montenegro, Guaporé and Não-Me-Toque, forming a corridor of technological development in the State.
According to Araújo (2013), these regions have physical and technical-scientific infrastructure suitable for
knowledge production, with a skilled labor market and a dense industrial network.
         Identified the basic characteristics of technological development and the production of knowledge
in Brazil, in terms of the distribution of the creation of innovation patents in the micro, the next step is to
find its basic determinants from the perspective of the theoretical proposition of section 2. Therefore, Table
3 brings the results of the Expanded Knowledge Production Function with path dependence and spatial
spillovers, estimated with the Dynamic Spatial Panel method for the period from 2004 to 2016.
         Prior to the estimation, we applied the Hausman test in order to verify the adequacy of the method
to the sample used. From this, it was possible to reject the null hypothesis that there is no systematic
difference between the estimated coefficients 5. Therefore, the estimation by fixed effect is in fact the most
adequate. In addition, we chose the spatial lag matrix that generated the largest Moran’s I coefficient for
the fixed effect (2) model residues (Appendix B) to estimate the Dynamic Spatial Panel Model, opting for
the three neighbors matrix. We identified the presence of heteroscedasticity and to control the problem, we
estimated the spatial models using the robust standard error by Huber/White/Sandwich (HUBER, 1967).
         Subsequently, we tried to define which spatial model is the one that best represents and captures the
dynamics of the phenomenon under study. Using the Akaike information criterion, the Dynamic Spatial
Autoregressive Model (DSAR) are the one that presented the lowest value for this adjustment criterion.
Considering the spatial dependence in the dynamic spatial models residuals (Appendix C and D), the DSAR
also are the best model, since it minimize the spatial effects on the residuals. This fact indicates that
knowledge creation in Brazil is not affected by spillovers of independent variables as proposed by Autant-
Bernard and LeSage (2011). Therefore, further analyzes are performed using the DSAR, which is disposed
in column (I) of Table 3.
         Among the results, we have that the time-lagged dependent variable, 𝐾𝑡−1 , presented a coefficient
(γ) statistically significant at the 1% level and with a positive impact on knowledge produced. Therefore,
the assumption of Fischer et al. (2009), that the production of knowledge in 𝑡 is positively influenced by
the quantity produced in 𝑡 − 1, was true for the microregions of Brazil. In others words, the innovation in
the country has an inertial component, assuming a pre-established trajectory, or path dependence, as in

where it is evident that the regions that were the largest producers of knowledge in 2005 continued to be in
2015, with few visible changes.

         On the other hand, the coefficients that aim to capture the knowledge spillovers in 𝑡, (𝜌), did present
statistical significance while the coefficient to capture in 𝑡 − 1, (𝜔), did not. Therefore, only the current
spatial spillovers component of the Extended Knowledge Production Function, based on Autant-Bernard
and LeSage (2011), 𝑊𝐾𝑖𝑡 , are relevant to explain innovation in Brazil, indicating that regions with high
knowledge production influence positively their neighbors and can be one of reasons for the spatial
concentration of knowledge in Figure 1 and 2. The spatial concentration phenomena occurs because certain
activities are agglomerated in a given locality due to the presence of attractive (centripetal) forces. This
result corroborates Gonçalves and Almeida (2009) and Araújo (2013) who found significant knowledge
spillovers in the country.
         An important determinant of knowledge production in Brazil are the population density in both
linear and quadratic form. They were significant at the 1% level and with expected signs, that is, with
positive and negative, respectively. This relationship confirms for Brazil the hypothesis of Jacobs (1969),
Krugman (1991) and Griliches (1992) on the importance of agglomeration economies and urbanization in
the production of knowledge. Therefore, the increase in the number of people in a certain locality of the
country is able to facilitate the diffusion, transmission and exchange of ideas among the economic agents,
factors capable of increasing the returns of the knowledge produced, due to the positive (Jacobian)
externalities. However, as indicated by the negative sign of the squared version of Population Density, these
                                                                                                              15




benefits of agglomeration occur until a certain urban scale, from which they begin to act as inhibitors in the
production of knowledge. Gonçalves and Almeida (2009) and Araújo (2013) also found a similar result for
Brazil. Therefore, this work corroborates the importance of Jacobian externalities and agglomeration
economies to explain the innovative process in the Brazilian microregions.
         Another important variable for the production of knowledge in the country is the number of
university researchers in the microregions, which obtained a positive sign for its coefficient and statistical
significance of 1%, a similar result to Gonçalves and Almeida (2009) and Araújo (2013). This variable is
part of the labor force, 𝐿𝑡 , employed in the search for new ideas, being intrinsically related to scientific and
technological research, which, according to Nelson (1996), are important vectors of knowledge production
and innovation. However, other components of the labor input in the EKPF, such as Private R&D (which
had as proxy, the professionals related to this activity) and workers with Higher Education are not
significant, which indicate a low return, in terms of innovation, for R&D in the Brazilian firms. Finally, the
Export of high and mid-high technologic intensity products presented statistical significance, confirming
that sectors intensive in capital and technology influence positively the innovation process.

5. Final Remarks

        This paper sought to provide a theoretical motivation for an Expanded Knowledge Production
Function (EKPF) that encompasses both path dependence and spatial spillovers. In addition, search for
evidence from Brazil using a Dynamic Spatial Panel Data approach, using the microregions as a basic
geographic cut. The purpose was to identify the determinants of knowledge production in the country as
well as its temporal evolution, using innovation patents as proxy. The years analyzed correspond to the
period from 2004 to 2016.
        The main evidence found regarding the distribution of knowledge production are the existence of
a North-South disparity for the innovative activity in Brazil, with São Paulo and the South of Brazil having
the two largest high-high clusters in the country. Some elements are preponderant for the determination
and explanation of the innovation in the period under analysis, with special importance for the path
dependence phenomenon and spatial spillovers from knowledge production. Therefore, the distribution of
the innovative activity in the country presents an inertial element, with regions that started before their
technological development having considerable advantages in the production of knowledge. Hence, the
unchanged North-South disparity for innovation in the country between 2004 and 2016 may be due to the
presence of path dependence, which makes it difficult to reduce regional differences. In addition, spatial
spillovers from knowledge reinforce the spatial agglomeration, since it influence the production of
knowledge in neighbors regions. Such evidence indicates the importance of targeted public policies for
some localities to be able to initiate a technological development trajectory, without which some
microregions will not reach the leading regions in knowledge production in Brazil.
        Other elements are also relevant to explain the production of knowledge in the country, in addition
to path dependence. The Population Density, for example, presented an inverted "U" influence with
innovation, capturing a nonlinear relation from agglomeration externality. Put another way, these benefits
of agglomeration occur until a certain urban scale, from which they begin to act as inhibitors in the
production of knowledge. This fact corroborates the importance of urbanization and the urban scale for
Brazilian technological activity. In addition, the number of university researchers, a proxy for R&D
conducted by universities, and the exports of high and mid-high technology products also proved to be
significant in explaining the production of knowledge in the country, as expected.
        From these evidences, we identified the key elements that boost innovation activity and the
production of knowledge in Brazil. However, the lack of significance of the other factors included in the
EKPF leaves open the reasons why these variables are not relevant for the country's knowledge production.
As an example, we can mention the cases of private R&D and investments in science and technology that
are expected to assist in the production of knowledge. However, such variables have not behaved as
expected for the country, evidencing a malfunction of these basic inputs, a fact that deserves attention by
public agents and researchers.
