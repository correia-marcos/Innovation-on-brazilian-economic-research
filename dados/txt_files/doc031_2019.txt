     This paper analyzes the behavior of the Central Bank of Brazil’s (Banco Central do Brasil -
     BCB) preference parameters during the period between 2000: Q1 and 2017: Q4. To this end, we
     assume that Brazil’s monetary policy is optimal and thus obtain the parameters of the policy
     function by estimating a macroeconomic model with backward-looking expectations and central
     bank preferences. The econometric approach used is based on Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
     Carlo (MCMC) estimation with the aid of the Kalman filter. Our results indicate that there
     was instability in the preferences over time, with fluctuations following the appointment of a
     new BCB president and during the 2008 international crisis.

1 Introduction
        Following the implementation of the inflation targeting regime in the late 1990s, the Central
Bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brasil - BCB) played a role in guiding monetary policy to achieve
price stability in the economy. The interest rate plays a crucial role in monetary policy behavior,
given fluctuations in output and inflation, as presented in Taylor (1993).1 Monetary authorities thus
face a trade-off between inflation stabilization or reduced unemployment. For Brazil, Minella et al.
(2000), Silva and Portugal (2001) and Minella et al. (2003) evaluated the effect of the interest rate
on macroeconomic variables and potential changes to the monetary policy regime.
        The importance that the BCB places on inflation relative to outputs can be established as a
fundamental preference measure for monetary policy decisions, as presented by Bogdanski, Tombini
and Werlang (2000). The interest rate rule can be obtained by solving an intertemporal optimization
problem with constraints as the monetary authority seeks to minimize the squared deviations of
the objective variables from their respective targets. The coefficients of the central bank’s reaction
function are thus a fusion of the economy’s preference and structural parameters.
        In this study, the estimation of the preference parameter for inflation is variable, as it may
exhibit different behavior over time. Monetary policy, together with time-varying preferences, estab-
lishes nonlinearities, which were estimated using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) incorporated into
the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The objective of
the study is thus to verify whether the BCB’s preferences varied over time, considering that the
study period included potential gradual changes in the economy and three different BCB presidents,
namely, Henrique de Campos Meirelles (2004-2010), Alexandre Antonio Tombini (2011-2016) and
Ilan Goldfajn (2016-present).
        Most of the studies that address central bank preferences seek to combine a macroeconomic
model with the first-order conditions of the policymakers. In studies focused on the United States’
central bank (Federal Reserve System - Fed), gradual changes in the sample vary according to the
interests of the central bank’s president, as shown by Favero and Rovelli (2003), Ozlale (2003),
Dennis (2006), Salemi (2006), Givens (2012) and Ilbas (2012). With a different focus, Söderström,
Söderlind and Vredin (2002) and Castelnuovo and Surico (2004) estimate the Fed’s preferences using
calibration. The authors found that the Fed attributes an important weight to interest rate smoothing
and places little importance on the output gap.
        Dennis (2006) estimated the parameters of the Fed’s reaction function together with the
parameters in its optimization constraints. Positing that the economy can be represented by the
model proposed in Rudebusch and Svensson (1999), the US inflation target was approximately 1.4%,
and policymakers attributed greater weight to interest rate smoothing. In turn, Ilbas (2012) used
Bayesian methods to estimate changes in US post-war monetary policy and concluded that output
growth is explained by the combination of two factors: the decreased volatility of the structural
shocks and the improved monetary policy behavior.
        Givens (2012) sought to estimate the Fed’s preferences under commitment and discretion.
The author used an empirical New Keynesian model in which monetary policy minimizes the cen-
tral bank’s loss function. With estimates for different periods (Volcker-Greenspan-Bernanke), it was
possible to observe that the estimates of the loss function weights suggest an excessive concern for
interest rate smoothing in the proposed model. The author also found a relative balance with respect
to inflation and output stability in the discretionary policy.
        For Brazil, Aragón and Portugal (2009) investigated monetary policy under the inflation tar-
geting regime by calibrating preferences and found that the BCB adopted a flexible inflation targeting
regime and placed greater importance on inflation stabilization. Finally, these authors found that
the monetary authority’s concern with interest smoothing was deeper than with output stabiliza-
1
    One explanation for why applying estimated rules is important to describe the evolution of monetary policy stems
    from the fact that estimated rules capture the systematic relationship between interest rates and macroeconomic
    variables and, as such, can be used as approximations for the central bank’s decision rules, as shown by Clarida,
    Gali and Gertler (2000).

tion. Similar results were found by Palma and Portugal (2011) and Palma and Portugal (2014). This
study thus seeks to contribute to the national literature by analyzing the BCB’s preferences with a
time-varying approach in the period from 2000: Q1 to 2017: Q4.
        The results indicate that there is some instability in the policymakers’ preferences, particu-
larly following the appointment of a new BCB president and during the 2008 international crisis.
The Brazilian monetary authority seeks to smooth the Special System for Settlement and Custody
(Sistema Especial de Liquidação e Custodia - Selic) interest rate, as well as control inflation and out-
put gap fluctuations, via interest rates. We also found that the long-term responses to inflation and
the output gap were larger during Henrique Meirelles’s term compared to his successor, Alexandre
Tombini.
        In addition to this introduction, this article is divided into five sections. The second section
shows an overview of Brazil’s monetary policy. The third section presents the theoretical model used
as a base for estimation. The fourth section is devoted to presenting the main methodological tools
used to estimate the BCB’s preferences. The fifth section presents the results. Finally, the sixth
section is devoted to the study’s conclusions.


2 An overview of Brazilian monetary policy
        Based on BCB reports, this section presents a broad overview of Brazil’s monetary policy and
the interest rate as a policy instrument for achieving inflation targets.
        According to Bogdanski, Tombini and Werlang (2000), Brazil’s inflation stabilization occurred
in mid-1994, resulting in single-digit inflation in less than three years. This process involved a series
of economic reforms such as a reduction of the public sector through privatizations, greater trade
liberalization with a reduction of tariffs and nontariff barriers, and a restructuring of the financial
system. The main measure of inflationary inertia—automatic indexing of prices, wages and other
contracts—was reduced considerably. As a consequence, annual output growth averaged 3.4% (in
real terms) from 1994 to 1998.
        Historically, countries that have adopted an inflation targeting regime—Australia, Canada,
New Zealand—have obtained satisfactory results, although it is only natural for economic recessions
to follow its adoption, and this was no different in Brazil. Although the stabilization of the Brazilian
economy was successful, there were still some structural economic problems, namely:

    ∙ increased vulnerability of the country’s confidence, exacerbated following the Russian morato-
      rium in August 1998;

    ∙ capital flight from emerging markets, as a consequence of the crisis of confidence; and

    ∙ strong pressures on exchange reserves.

         The inflation targeting regime was instituted in Brazil in July 1999. This regime took the
following assumptions as its objectives: i) set inflation targets based on a predetermined price index;
ii) assigned to the BCB the task of achieving the target; and iii) made the National Monetary Council
(Conselho Monetário Nacional - CMN) responsible for determining the inflation targets, their relative
ranges of variation and the price index to be followed.
         Concomitant with the above measures, the Monetary Policy Committee (Comitê de Política
Monetária - COPOM) determined the basic interest rate of the Brazilian economy (Selic) as a
monetary policy measure for inflation control.2 According to Carvalho et al. (2007), Selic is used
to carry out transactions between financial institutions and functions as the government’s main
monetary instrument.
2
    According to the BCB, the Selic rate is the adjusted average rate of daily financing calculated in the Selic system for
    federal securities. The rate calculation considers the daily financing relative to transactions registered and settled
    in Selic and in systems operated by clearing and asset settlement services.

2.1 Interest rate as a monetary policy instrument
        After implementing the inflation targeting regime and a floating exchange rate, in effect since
1999, the interest rate was used as the main monetary policy instrument for pursuing price stability.
In this initial period, the inflation target was reduced in 2000 due to the turbulent international sce-
nario. Some situations occurring around the world at the time included increased oil prices, political
problems in the US and a critical scenario experienced by the Argentine economy. Figure 1 presents
a series of the Selic interest rates accumulated monthly, annualized for the 2000-2017 period.
        Following the recovery of the Brazilian economy in late 2000, reflecting the positive evolution
of the macroeconomic fundamentals and low instability in the international environment, a target of
15.25% per annum (p.a.) was set for the Selic rate for January 2001. As of March 2001, there was
an increase in the exchange rate (currency depreciation), and under these conditions, the COPOM
raised the target for the economy’s basic interest rate to the level of 19% p.a. in July, returning to
the level observed in the early months of 2000.
        According to the bulletin of the BCB (2004), in 2004, with Henrique de Campos Meirelles
serving as the BCB’s president, the COPOM interrupted the monetary policy easing process, which
began in June 2003. This cautious measure was imposed with the objective of meeting the inflation
target for 2004, given the increase in commodity prices caused by the high growth of the world
economy. The target for the basic interest rate was set at 17.75% p.a. in late 2004.
        In 2006, price stability was preferred in the monetary policy behavior.3 In the first three
months, the COPOM reduced the Selic rate target by 0.75% p.a., subsequently applying another
cut of 0.5% p.a. in the ensuing months. This reduction in the basic interest rate represented two
uncertainties to the economy: i) the degree of monetary policy easing that began in 2005; and ii) the
external liquidity conditions resulting from changes in US monetary policy behavior, as presented in
BCB (2006).4
        In early 2008, the COPOM acted more cautiously in guiding monetary policy, given that
the world and domestic economy showed signs of recovery, legitimizing a more restrictive monetary
policy. During July of that same year, given the acceleration of wholesale prices and an increase in the
inflation expectation, the decision was made to raise the economy’s basic interest rate. Finally, at the
end of the year, the committee decided to keep the interest rate high due to some negative aspects
encouraged by the international crisis, namely, uncertainty in the positive evolution of economic
activity and a decrease in consumer and entrepreneur confidence.
        According to the BCB (2010), the economy’s official price index, the Broad Consumer Price
Index (Índice de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo - IPCA), remained between 2.5% and 6.5% in 2010,
and the Selic rate target reached 8.75% p.a., which was the lowest level since the implementation of
the inflation targeting regime in 1999. As the months passed, this rate was raised to 10.75% p.a., as
shown in Figure 1. In this scenario, the CMN, together with authorities from the BCB and COPOM,
adopted some important measures, including compulsory reserve and credit increases.
        Following the deceleration of the Brazilian economy in the second half of 2011, the COPOM
decided to reduce the Selic interest rate repeatedly throughout 2012. At the end of that year, the
economic environment showed a favorable balance of risks for inflation, recovery of the domestic econ-
omy and the complexity surrounding the international economy, and these circumstances contributed
to the COPOM keeping the economy’s interest rate at a low level.
        As stated in BCB (2014), over the next few years, the COPOM raised the Selic rate from 10%
p.a. at the end of 2013 to approximately 11.75% p.a. at the end of 2014. This is justified by the fact
that the relative price adjustments in the economy caused a deterioration in the balance of risks for
inflation. The monetary authorities thus reached a consensus regarding the adjustment of monetary
3
    Based on the annual inflation target set at 4.5% by the CMN, the COPOM reduced the target for the basic interest
    rate to 13.25% p.a. in December 2006.
4
    The easing of the monetary policy in Brazil was enabled by the downward trend in the inflation expectations
    for 2006. That same year, an equivalent trend was confirmed, beginning in September 2007, in the price index
    expectations.

next two years, 2015 and 2016.

       As shown in appendix C, the inflation trajectory points to signs of changes in the preferences
of the monetary authorities only at specific points in the economy; for example, after the 2003
presidential election, we observed a drop in the general price level, which rose once more in 2014. For
the output gap, we found a clear deceleration during the 2008 international crisis. The trajectory of
the variables thus indicates a slight change in the policymakers’ preferences at specific periods in the
Brazilian economy.


3 Theoretical Model
        This section is devoted to presenting the theoretical model that will be used to estimate the
BCB’s preferences. This model is grounded in three elements: constraints, loss function and optimal
policy.

3.1 Constraints
       In this study, we consider a simple structural macroeconomic model with backward-looking
expectations. The studies of Favero and Rovelli (2003), Ozlale (2003), Dennis (2006) and Lakdawala
(2016) used this model to study central bank preferences. The model’s equations are as follows:

                     𝜋𝑡 = 𝑏0 + 𝑏1 𝜋𝑡−1 + 𝑏2 𝜋𝑡−2 + 𝑏3 𝜋𝑡−3 + 𝑏3𝐴 𝜋𝑡−4 + 𝑏4 𝑦𝑡−1 + 𝜇𝜋,𝑡                (1)
em que b3𝐴 = 1 − 𝑏1 − 𝑏2 − 𝑏3 .

                           𝑦𝑡 = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1 𝑦𝑡−1 + 𝑎2 𝑦𝑡−2 + 𝑎3 (𝑖𝑡−1 − 𝜋𝑡−1 ) + 𝜇𝑦,𝑡                     (2)
in which 𝜋𝑡 is the annualized quarterly inflation rate and 𝑦𝑡 is the output gap (obtained by the
difference between the observed output and its potential value). The real interest rate, 𝑟𝑡−1 , is defined


                                                     5
as the difference between the nominal interest rate (𝑖𝑡−1 ), considered as a monetary policy instrument,
and the economy’s inflation rate (𝜋𝑡−1 ). The error terms 𝜇𝜋,𝑡 and 𝜇𝑦,𝑡 are independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) and are interpreted as supply and demand shocks, respectively.
        The Phillips or aggregate supply curve (1) shows that the current inflation depends on its past
values and the fluctuation of the output gap in the previous period. Equation (2) is a conventional
investment/saving (IS) curve where the output gap at time 𝑡 depends on its lagged values and the
real interest rate in the previous period. The coefficient 𝑎3 , which measures the output gap response
at the real interest rate, should be negative.

3.2 Loss function
       Following Rudebusch and Svensson (1999), we assume that the monetary authority seeks to
choose a path for the policy instrument (the nominal interest rate) to minimize:5
                                       ∞
                             𝐿 = 𝐸˜𝑡         𝛽 𝑗 [𝛼𝑡 (𝜋𝑡+𝑗
                                                       𝑎
                                                           − 𝜋𝑡* )2 + 𝑦𝑡+𝑗
                                                                       2
                                                                           + 𝜈(𝑖𝑡+𝑗 − 𝑖𝑡+𝑗−1 )2 ]
                                       ∑︁
                                                                                                                           (3)
                                       𝑗=0

where 𝐸𝑡 is the expectation operator conditioned on the set of data available at 𝑡; 𝛽 is the discount rate
(0 < 𝛽 < 1); 𝛼 > 0; the weight of the output gap relative to inflation is normalized to 1; and 𝜈, which
represents the interest rate smoothing coefficient, should be equal to or greater than 0.6 With loss
function 𝐿, the monetary authority is assumed to stabilize the annual inflation, 𝜋𝑡𝑎 = (1/4) 3𝑗=0 𝜋𝑡−𝑗 ,
                                                                                                ∑︀

around an inflation target (𝜋 * ) to keep the output gap closed at zero and smooth the nominal
interest rate. Appendix A shows the detailed mathematical derivation of the model in a state-space
representation and the optimal policy rule.
        According to Lakdawala (2016), the theoretical motivation of the third term (𝜈(𝑖𝑡+𝑗 −𝑖𝑡+𝑗−1 )2 )
is based on the desirable effects of private sector expectations.7 This term may also be motivated
by the central bank’s desire to reduce asset price volatility to prevent high interest rate swings.
Rudebusch (2002), Rudebusch (2006) and Castelnuovo and Surico (2004) argued that the central
bank does not use the smoothing device directly but rather follows autocorrelated shocks that affect
the economy or potential concern with the model’s uncertainty. However, in recent empirical studies,
Hamilton, Pruitt and Borger (2011) and Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2012) found that the central
bank is truly concerned with interest rate smoothing.
        Several points justify the use of the interest rate smoothing term: i) the data and coefficients
of monetary policy transmission present uncertainties; ii) policymakers only take action when there
is certainty about the results of these actions; iii) changes in interest rates may destabilize the
financial and exchange markets; iv) reversions in monetary policy actions can be observed as errors
or evidence of political consistency; and v) small and persistent changes in the short-term interest
rate allow monetary policy to affect aggregate demand without the imposing volatility of the policy
instrument. For further clarification on the interest rate smoothing term, see Clarida, Galı and Gertler
(1998), Woodford (1999), Sack and Wieland (2000) and Woodford (2003).
        In this study, the weight on inflation relative to the output gap (𝛼𝑡 ) is variable over time. In
literature, there are several studies treating this parameter as time-varying.8 First, this weight may
change depending on the BCB’s personnel; new employees may be more concerned with stabilizing
the economy’s inflation or guiding the policy in an effort to decrease unemployment. Second, there
is a distinct degree of political pressure on the central bank, as shown by Maggio (2010) and Meltzer
5
    According to Aragón and Portugal (2009), there are two reasons to use the quadratic loss function: i) this type of
    function, associated with linear restrictions, results in a linear policy rule; and, ii) it allows for the inclusion of the
    nominal interest rate smoothing term.
6
    As shown by Rudebusch and Svensson (1999), when 𝛽 −→ 1, the policymaker’s optimization problem and the
    intertemporal loss function can be interpreted as an unconditional mean of the loss function at time 𝑡, given by
    𝐸[𝐿𝑡 ] = 𝛼[𝜋𝑡 − 𝜋 * ] + 𝜆𝑦 𝑣𝑎𝑟[𝑦𝑡 ] − 𝜈[𝑖𝑡 − 𝑖( 𝑡 − 1)].

(2011). Lakdawala (2016) argues that this change in political pressure can be captured over time in
the weight the central bank puts on inflation relative to the output gap. The specified loss factor,
with the weight of inflation on the output gap varying in time, is a simple and appropriate way to
obtain central bank preferences.

3.3 Optimal policy
       For each period 𝑡, the monetary authority determines the economy’s interest rates. We want
to observe the behavior of central bank preference parameters using a time-varying model.
       The central bank minimizes the loss function (3) subject to the constraints given by the
structural model (1)-(2). The derivation of the optimal policy rule is thus based on the state-space
representation, denoted by (4):

                                          𝑍𝑡+1 = 𝐶 + 𝐷𝑍𝑡 + 𝐵𝑋𝑡 + 𝜇𝑡+1                                            (4)
where column vector 𝑍𝑡 represents the state variables, matrix 𝐷, column vector 𝐵 and the column
vector of disturbances, 𝜇𝑡 + 1.
       The interest rate rule is thus given by:


              𝑖𝑡 = 𝑓𝑡 + 𝑓1,𝑡 𝜋𝑡 + 𝑓2,𝑡 𝜋𝑡−1 + 𝑓3,𝑡 𝜋𝑡−2 + 𝑓4,𝑡 𝜋𝑡−3 + 𝑓5,𝑡 𝑦𝑡 + 𝑓6,𝑡 𝑦𝑡−1 + 𝑓7,𝑡 𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝜇𝑖,𝑡     (5)

where the nominal interest rate (control variable) at [︁time 𝑡 is a linear function of ]︁the state vari-
able vector 𝑍𝑡 . The coefficients of line vector 𝑓 = 𝑓 𝑓1 𝑓2 𝑓3 𝑓4 𝑓5 𝑓6 𝑓7 represent an
interaction of the central bank preference parameters and the Phillips and IS curve parameters.
Therefore, for each preference parameter value for inflation relative to output gap, there is an op-
timal rule. The coefficients of this rule, 𝑓𝑖,𝑡 , depend on the constant parameters of the constraints
(𝑏0 , 𝑏1 , 𝑏2 , 𝑏3 , 𝑏3𝐴 , 𝑏4 , 𝑎0 , 𝑎1 , 𝑎2 , 𝑎3 ), the interest rate smoothing parameter and the time-varying pref-
erence parameter. We estimate Equation (5) with a shock, 𝜇𝑖,𝑡 . This shock can be observed as a
pure random component of monetary policy. Moreover, to capture the changes in monetary policy
behavior, it is assumed that the parameters of the reaction function are time-varying and follow a
random walk, as discussed by Cooley and Prescott (1976).


4 Estimation
       Equation (5) was estimated with a shock, 𝜇𝑖,𝑡 , to eliminate the singularity problem in the
estimation of the vector autoregression (VAR) parameters.9 Equations (1), (2) e (5) podem escritas
da seguinte forma:

                       𝐴0,𝑡 𝑦^𝑡 = 𝐴1,𝑡 + 𝐴2,𝑡 𝑦^𝑡−1 + 𝐴3,𝑡 𝑦^𝑡−2 + 𝐴4,𝑡 𝑦^𝑡−3 + 𝐴5,𝑡 𝑦^𝑡−4 + 𝐿𝛹𝑡 𝜇𝑡              (6)
      The 𝐴𝑖,𝑡 matrices are functions of the time-varying preference parameter (𝛼𝑡 ), modeled as a
random walk:

                                                    𝛼𝑡 = 𝛼𝑡−1 + 𝑧𝑡                                               (7)
where the shock, 𝑧𝑡 𝑁 (0, 𝑄), is assumed to be independent of the shocks to the structural model. The
random walk process, widely used in literature,10 is an accessible and parsimonious way of modeling
time-varying parameters, as it can detect permanent shifts in the preference parameter, simplifying
the estimation relative to a general autoregressive process, as presented by Lakdawala (2016).

     Some studies used models following a random walk, including Cogley and Sargent (2001), Cogley and Sargent
     (2005), Boivin (2006) and Kim and Nelson (2006).

       The error vector 𝜇𝑡 consists of three shocks: a supply shock (𝜇𝜋,𝑡 ), a demand shock (𝜇𝑦,𝑡 ) and
a shock involving the interest rate (𝜇𝑖,𝑡 ). The model assumed the following covariance matrix:
                                                     (︃[︃        ]︃)︃           [︃       ]︃

       Some studies indicate that there is heteroskedasticity in the exogenous shocks included in
macroeconomic models that involve inflation, output gap and interest rate.11 The triangular decom-

       Since the model is characterized by the constraints, the optimal interest rate rule and the
random walk process for the time-varying parameters, we can now write it in a state-space represen-
tation. We thus express the following nonlinear space system:

                                                𝑦𝑡 = ℎ(𝛼𝑡 , 𝑋𝑡 , 𝛤, 𝜇𝑡 )                               (8)

                                                     𝛼𝑡 = 𝛼𝑡−1 + 𝑧𝑡                                    (9)

where 𝛤 = 𝛿, 𝜈, 𝐿, 𝛹𝑡 . We estimate the following set of parameters: 𝛼𝑡 : time-varying weight of
inflation; 𝛿: coefficients of the constraints (1), (2); 𝜈: weight on interest rate smoothing; 𝜓𝑡 : stan-
dard deviations; 𝑁 : covariance terms; and 𝑄: variance of the shock to the time-varying preference
parameter.

4.1 Bayesian MCMC approach
        To estimate the model’s parameters as random variables, we follow Lakdawala (2016) and use
Bayesian MCMC estimation. This method involves numerical sampling of the posterior distribution,
which is done using the random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) algorithm.
        For linear state-space models, the Kalman filter is suitable for evaluating the likelihood func-
tion. In this study, the preference parameter is nonlinear, and thus the EKF was used to linearize the
observation equation at each point in time using a first-order Taylor expansion, and we then applied
the techniques of the standard filter described. Based on nonlinear state-space representation of (8)
and (9), the following equations show how to evaluate the likelihood using the EKF:

       The likelihood is combined with the prior to obtain the posterior. We followed a two-step
procedure. First, we numerically maximized the log of the posterior probability distribution to obtain
a posterior estimate. Second, using the previously calculated posterior mode as a starting value, we
used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to characterize the posterior distribution.
       Let 𝜃 be the parameter vector to be estimated. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generates
a draw from a candidate generating density, 𝑞(.). Let this candidate draw be known as 𝜃𝑔+1 . This
new draw is thus accepted with the following probability:

where 𝑐 is a scale factor and 𝐻

mean acceptance rate of the chain was 32%.12 MATLAB R2015a software was used for estimation,

4.2 Data
       The estimation of the BCB’s loss function with a time-varying preference parameter was
based on quarterly data; the full sample covers 2000: Q1 to 2017: Q4. This period of analysis was
chosen considering that, between 1994 and 1999, there were two important milestones in the Brazilian
economy: the implementation of the Plano Real and the change to the exchange rate regime (from a
fixed to a floating exchange rate). Furthermore, the period chosen covers only one monetary policy
regime—the inflation targeting regime.13
       We decided to use a quarterly frequency for two reasons: (i) quarterly data are less susceptible
to noise and measurement errors; and (ii) to decrease monetary policy lag, in case the policy affects
two or three periods after the policy is implemented. The dataset used includes the macroeconomic
variables—inflation rate (𝜋), Selic interest rate (𝑖) and output gap (𝑦) - obtained from the Brazilian
Institute of Geography ans Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística - IBGE) and the
BCB.

     This number of draws is sufficient to ensure convergence, as established by Raftery and Lewis (1992).

     This fact diminishes the importance of the critique by Lucas (1976).

       The variable 𝜋 refers to the cumulative inflation for the last 12 months, measured by the
IPCA and used as an inflation target (𝜋 * ) by the BCB. The output gap (𝑦) is obtained from the
percentage difference between the seasonally adjusted quarterly real GDP and its trend (proxy for
the potential output), measured by the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter14 , and the Selic interest rate (𝑖)
is annualized (quarterly mean).15


5 Results
5.1 Estimation of parameters
         We used data from 2000: Q1 to 2003: Q4 as a pre-sample to obtain the priors. For this initial
sample, we estimated a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The priors for the coefficients of the
constraints, 𝛿, are assumed with normal distribution with a prior mean equal to the SUR estimate
for the pre-sample and high variance to ensure that it has noninformative value. The prior for the
interest rate smoothing weight, 𝜈, has uniform distribution with a positive real value. The variances,
𝜎𝑖,𝑡 , are assumed to be inverse gamma, with a shape and scale defined by 2 and 1, respectively.
Finally, the variance of the time-varying parameter, 𝑄, is defined by uniform distribution with a
positive real number. Table 2 shows a summary of the priors.

        To estimate the RWMH algorithm, it was first necessary to calibrate the discount factor (𝛽)
and inflation target (𝜋 * ) parameters. Following Castro et al. (2011), we established that 𝛽 is equal
to 0.989 and 𝜋 * is 4.5%, as Brazil’s inflation target has been at that level since 2005.
        The values of the estimated parameters are shown in Table 3. These values were obtained
along with the 5th and 95th percentiles of the posterior distribution. The standard error for each
parameter was also calculated. The results were compared with those in the literature.
        As shown in Table 3, 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏𝑖 are parameters of constraints; 𝜎𝑖,𝑡 and 𝑙𝑖 refer to the standard
deviations and the covariance terms of the variance matrix; 𝜈 is the interest rate smoothing weight
of the loss function; and 𝑄 is the variance of the shocks in the equation governing the weight of the
time-varying parameter.
        In general, the parameter estimates have the expected signs. For the Phillips curve, the excep-
tion was 𝑏2 , which had a negative sign. The parameter that measures the impact of the output gap
on the inflation rate presented a lower value compared to the result found by Aragón and Portugal
14
     To calculate the output gap, 𝜆 = 1600 was used, as suggested by Hodrick and Prescott (1997).

(2009) and was also not statistically significant. These authors estimated a structural macroeconomic
model for a small open economy, without considering a constant variable in the estimation of the IS
and Phillips curves.
        With regard to the IS curve, as expected, the coefficient for the real interest rate’s effect on
the output gap had a negative sign. In this case, a 1% increase in the real interest rate estimate
suggests a decrease of 0.04% in the annualized inflation, but the parameter does not present a value
statistically different from zero. Aragón and Portugal (2009) found that a 1% increase in the real
interest rate caused a fall of 0.09% in the annualized inflation.

         As shown in Table 3, the interest rate smoothing parameter has a high value statistically
different from zero. For Brazil, the value of the interest rate smoothing found by Palma and Portugal
(2011) was 20.005. In the international literature, this parameter has a value above 30.16 There is
still discussion about the true source of smoothing observed in the policy parameter.
         The sign of the parameter 𝑎0 is different from the studies in the international literature. The
coefficient 𝑎2 in this study has a negative value, unlike the results found in Rudebusch and Svensson
(1999) and Dennis (2006). The signs of the other terms are similar. With regard to the IS curve, the
parameters were similar, although the constant parameter (𝑏0 ) for this paper was negative (although
not significant), relative to the studies in the general literature.

        The solid blue line in Figure 2 represents the estimate of the smoothed value of the variable
preference parameter using the posterior mean of the constant parameters (described in Table 3).
The dashed black line indicates the confidence interval for plus or minus one standard deviation.
These confidence bands consider the uncertainty of the Kalman filter and the uncertainty of the
parameter.
        As Figure 2 suggests, during the term of Henrique de Campos Meirelles (2004-2011), there
were small shifts in the weight given to inflation. With the appointment of Antonio Alexandre
Tombini, there was a drop in the weight and some fluctuations during his term. At the beginning
of Ilan Goldfajn’s term, there seems to have been greater concern with controlling inflation, as we
noticed a rising weight attributed to the parameter, flexible in time. We observed that after the 2008
international crisis, there was a downward trend in the weight of inflation.
        Previous studies for Brazil estimated the central bank’s loss function considering constant
parameters. For the inflation preference parameter, Aragón and Portugal (2009) found a value of
0.73, Palma and Portugal (2011) arrived at 0.83 and Palma and Portugal (2014) obtained 0.42. The
first two studies estimated the preferences using maximum likelihood, and the latter used Bayesian
methods for a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model.

output gap represented by equations (22) and (23):

       Panel (A) in Figure 3 indicates that the long-term response to inflation has a mean value of
4.39 for the full sample and was greater during Henrique Meirelles’s term when compared to the
period when Alexandre Tombini was the BCB’s president. We note a positive trend in the long-term
response to inflation during the early years of Henrique Meirelles’s term and a sharp drop following
the 2008 international crisis.

       Panel (B) in Figure 3 shows the interest rate’s response to changes in the output gap over
time. We observed that after the international crisis and the start of Alexander Tombini’s term,
there was a downward trend in the interest rate’s response to the output gap. The mean value of
our estimates suggests that the BCB was more concerned with guiding the interest rate in response
to the output gap during Henrique Meirelles’s term when compared to the term of his successor.
Aragón and Medeiros (2015) found that the Brazilian monetary authorities were more concerned
with controlling the interest rate in response to the output gap following the 2008 international crisis
compared to the pre-crisis period. These authors estimated the BCB’s reaction function considering
forward-looking expectations with time-varying parameters for the period 2002-2011.
       Table 4 shows the optimal rules for different BCB presidents based on the mean of the time-
varying parameter. We observed that, on average, the parameter that measures the weight of inflation
preference relative to the output gap was greater during Alexandre Tombini’s term. The estimated
optimal rule for Henrique Meirelles shows that a 1% increase in inflation raises the interest rate by
1.25%, while a 1% increase in the output gap raises the interest rate by approximately 4.1295%.
The coefficient that measures the inertia of the interest rate presented a value of 0.5065, i.e., a 1%
increase in the interest rate of the previous period causes an increase of 0.51% in the interest rate of
the current period.

        The estimated coefficients of the optimal rule for Alexandre Tombini show that a 1% increase

interest rate by 3.60%. Similar to the case of Henrique Meirelles, the coefficient that measures the

autoregressive process of the interest rate presented a high value (1.25), indicating the Brazilian
monetary authority’s concern with smoothing the Selic rate. In both cases of optimal rule, the
monetary authority responds to the lagged values of the inflation rate and the output gap, although
this response is weaker when compared to period 𝑡.
        In addition to the short-term coefficients f described in the optimal rule, the state variables
also have secondary effects on the interest rate due to their lagged values and the inertial term of the
interest rate 𝑖𝑡−1 . We evaluated these effects in Table 4, and they are described by the coefficients
𝜑1,𝑡 and 𝜑2,𝑡 . As established by the long-term rule, during Henrique Meirelles’s term, a sustained
1% increase in inflation enables an increase in the Selic rate of 4.57%, while a 1% increase in the
output gap raises the Selic rate by approximately 6.24%. For Alexandre Tombini, the coefficients that
measure the long-term responses to inflation and the output gap were 3.63 and 5.85, respectively. The
interest rate’s response to inflation was thus more than proportional, corroborating the Taylor rule.
Estimating the BCB’s loss function with constant parameters, Aragón and Portugal (2009) found
that during the period 1999-2007, there was also a more than proportional increase in the interest
rate in response to inflation.

6 Conclusions
        In recent years, numerous empirical studies have evaluated the central bank’s actions using
monetary policy estimation. This procedure is limited, given that optimal policy rules are restricted
to equations whose coefficients are convolutions of policymakers’ preferences and economic behavioral
patterns.
        We assume that the monetary authority solves an intertemporal optimization problem re-
stricted to a simple macroeconomic model with backward-looking expectations. This study thus
evaluated the behavior of the BCB’s preferences by considering the time-varying inflation preference
parameter relative to the output gap. Our results suggest the following: (i) there was some instability
in the varying parameter, with fluctuations following the appointment of a new BCB president and
during the 2008 international crisis; (ii) the Brazilian monetary authority was concerned with inter-
est rate smoothing; (iii) the long-term responses to inflation and the output gap were greater during
Henrique Meirelles’s term compared to his successor; and (iv) the responses of both presidents to a
unitary shock in inflation were similar.
        There are countless studies in literature seeking to understand changes in central bank pref-
erences. We can categorize the changes into two areas: changes that are policy errors and changes
as a consequence of policy preferences. Although the literature focuses on the first line of thought,
the primary motivation of this study is that insufficient attention is given to changes in central bank
behavior. The results motivate future studies that consider time-varying preferences for a small open
economy.
