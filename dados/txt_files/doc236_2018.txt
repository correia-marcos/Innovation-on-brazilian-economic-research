Abstract Education related changes are often argued as the main reasons for changes in earnings
distribution. However, omitted variable and measurement error biases possibly affect econometric
estimates of these effects. Brazil experienced a sharp fall of individual labour income inequality between
1996 and 2014. Coincidently, there are special supplements of PNAD on family background in these two
years that allow us to better address the role played by falling education returns. This note takes advantage
of this information to provide new estimates of the level and evolution of the returns to education in Brazil
using variable premiums by education level, quantile regressions and pseudo panels. Regarding
measurement error, the empirical strategy is to make use of the information of who responded the PNAD
questionnaire but controlling for availability biases. We find evidence of attenuation bias which reduces
mean returns from education between 14% and 32%. On the other hand, omitting parents’ education
information also accounting for selectivity issues reduces the premium estimates by 24 per cent. Perhaps
more importantly, the fall of education premium is heavily underestimated when we do not take into
account family background. The highest fall of returns occurred in intermediary levels of education and
income. Cohort effects also show that the reduction in the educational premium has been going on over
several generations. Finally, we assess how parents’ education affect the educational outcomes of their
children and how the intergenerational mobility of education has evolved over the last years. We find a
reduction on the intergenerational persistence of education from 0.7 to 0.47 between 1996 and 2014. Cohort
effects regarding intergenerational mobility show that this is stronger for younger cohorts, which coincides
with the fall of education premiums.

Resumo Mudanças relacionadas a educação são frequentemente consideradas as principais razões para
mudanças em distribuição de rendas. Porém, variáveis omitidas e vieses de erros de mensuração afetam as
estimativas econométricas desses efeitos. O Brasil experimentou uma queda na desigualdade de renda do
trabalho individual entre 1996 e 2014. Coincidentemente, existem suplementos especiais da PNAD com
histórico familiar nesses dois anos que nos permitem melhor abordar o papel da queda dos retornos de
educação. Esse texto aproveita essa informação para fornecer novas estimativas do nível e da evolução dos
retornos de educação no Brasil usando prêmios variáveis por nível educacional, regressões quantílicas e
pseudo painéis. Em relação aos erros de mensuração, a estratégia empírica é usar a informação dos que
responderam o questionário da PNAD mas controlar para vieses de disponibilidade. Encontramos evidência
de viés de atenuação que reduz a média dos retornos de educação entre 14 e 32%. Do outro lado, a
informação omitida da educação dos pais, ajustada para problemas de seletividade, reduz a estimativa de
prêmio em 24%. Talvez o mais importante seja que a queda do prêmio da educação é altamente subestimada
quando não se leva em consideração o histórico familiar. A maior queda de retornos ocorreu nos níveis
intermediários de educação e renda. O efeito de Coorte também mostra que a redução no prêmio
educacional vem acontecendo há várias gerações. Finalmente, avaliamos como a educação dos pais afeta
os resultados educacionais das suas crianças e como a mobilidade intergeracional de educação evoluiu nos
últimos anos. Encontramos uma redução na persistência intergeracional de educação de 0.7 para 0.47 entre
1996 e 2014. Efeitos de Coorte em relação a mobilidade intergeracional também mostram que uma queda
na persistência de educação é também forte para coortes mais novos, o que coincide com a queda dos
prêmios de educação.

 Returns to Education, Intergenerational Mobility and Inequality Changes in Brazil

   1. Introduction
        In contrast to what is happening in most developed countries, in the past two decades there was a
significant decrease in inequality in Latin American Countries. In the case of Brazil, after increasing in the
1960s and 1970s, earnings inequality started to fall in the mid 1990s and this fall persisted even more
sharply in the 2000s until 2014. Using data from representative national household surveys, income
inequality measures present a strong fall in household per capita income inequality in the 2000s; when we
look only at labour earnings inequality, inequality started falling some years earlier. This recent period of
inequality reduction has a strong correlation with recent movements in the returns to education. While in
most developed countries and many developing countries, the educational premium has been increasing
altogether with inequality levels, for Brazil we observed the opposite movement. (Lam, Finn and Leibbrant
2015; Chetty et al. 2017).
        The paper has two main objectives. First, to provide new estimates of the level and evolution of the
returns to education in Brazil based on a recently launched dataset of a representative household survey
that contains a rich and unique variety of characteristics which include family educational background,
more precisely the level of education of both parents, which permit us to address some important
econometric issues regarding omitted variable bias. Also, we have information on who actually responded
the questionnaire of the survey, which will used as an instrument to assess and deal with measurement error
bias. We will make use of two supplements from the Brazilian national representative household survey
PNAD that cover the recent period of labour income inequality reduction, more precisely the supplements
on intergenerational education for 1996 and 2014. Second, using this information, we assess how parent’s
education affect the educational level of their children and how the intergenerational mobility of education
has evolved over the last years. We will also explore the rich information available in PNAD to assess
differences in wage premiums and in the intergenerational mobility of education for different groups. In
particular, we will examine closely the operation of cohort and distributive effects using pseudo panels and
quantile regressions.
        The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we estimate the returns to education in Brazil
for the recent period of inequality reduction. We start by assessing measurement error bias using the
information on who responded the PNAD questionnaire. Then, we use the information on the education of
the parents to see how the inclusion of these previously omitted variable affect the estimated returns. We
also examine cohorts and distributive effects by using pseudo panels and quantile regressions, respectively.
In the last section, we assess the level of intergenerational mobility in education and how the persistence
has evolved over the past two decades in the country, as well as how it varies among different generations
and along the income distribution.



   2. Returns to Education
        It is well known in the labour economics literature that there are important econometric problems
to estimate returns to education or wage premiums based on standard Mincerian equations (Mincer 1974;
Lemieux 2006). Education premium estimation requires ideally evaluating related measurement errors and
omitted variable biases (Card 2001).
        Our strategy is to start with a basic Mincerian model and then look at different extensions for 2014
and compare with the estimations for 1996. Consider the following regression:

                                    = log      =   +       +     +      (1) ,




                                                       2
where is the labour income of individual , is the level of education of individual measured by years
of schooling, is a vector of controls and is an error term. In the basic model, we will use as controls
age, age squared, gender, geographic region of residence, race and a dummy for urban area.
       With this simple model, we can evaluate more clearly changes of the impacts of education on the
earnings distribution including different proxies of family educational background one by one.

Measurement Error and Attenuation Bias
        Regarding measurement error, the empirical strategy pursued is to make use of the information of
who responded the PNAD questionnaire on income and education, which is available in the 2014
supplement, as a proxy for measurement error and try to provide better estimates. The idea is that the
measurement error will be smaller if the individual responded the questions for himself than if it was
another person. In PNAD 2014, almost half of the sample responded the questionnaires for themselves,
which suggest a potential large problem often ignored in household survey analysis. We split the sample in
two parts: one considering only the cases in which the own person responds his labour earnings and
education and another considering only the cases in which another person in the dwelling and in some rare
cases outside the household answers at least one of the questions. We will use the impacts of the identity
of who answers the questionnaire on the estimated R-squared and educational premium coefficients of the
regression as proxies for measurement error. Therefore, the magnitude of the measurement error can be
grasped intuitively by this sample split.
        We start by estimating a Mincerian regression controlling for the information on the parent’s
education as well age, age squared, gender, geographic region of residence and dummies for urban areas.
The results presented in the table below can be seen as potential indicators of the impacts of measurement
error.

        The table shows that, consistent with the effects caused by measurement error that tend to spread
the variance of income, the overall R-squared of the regression for those who answer the question for
themselves is substantially higher than in that when another person answers.
        A key implication of measurement error in the Mincerian regression is the occurrence of attenuation
bias in the education coefficient. As we can see, the years of schooling coefficient is also significantly
greater in the sample of those who declared their own income and education. Just to make sure that the
attenuation bias is statistically significant, we piled up the two samples and run a similar regression with
dummies for the different sample of responders as well as these dummies interacting with the years of
schooling coefficient. We have that the last coefficient turns out to be greater and statistically significant in
the sample of own respondents. More precisely, the coefficient is 0.027 (with standard error 0.004), which
means that the estimated education premium is approximately 2.7 per cent greater for the sample of own
respondents.
        One final problem with the estimation above is that there may be selectivity in the generation
process of different responders’ samples according to availability to answer the questionnaire, which could
result in a disposability bias. For example, spouses that are mothers with small kids are more likely to be
at home to answer the household survey questionnaires. Indeed, while only 46 per cent of the male

                                                        3
responded the question about education for themselves, the corresponding number for the women is 65 per
cent, which may well affect the education premium results.
       To deal with this selectivity bias, we used a standard logistic regression matching procedure in
which we created two equal sized and more comparable samples regarding the profile of the respondents.
The selection model incorporated the following variables: position in the household, if the respondent is a
mother, the age of the youngest child, the type of family and individual working class.

        The results using the matched sample suggest that indeed the initial comparison was probably
somewhat affected by selectivity bias. The variance of the logs of income is 18.6 per cent smaller in the
matched sample than in the original one. Also, the respective proportion of these inequality measures
explained differs as expected for the two subsamples.
        In the matched sample, the difference of the R-squared of those who answered the question for
themselves in comparison to the information of non-direct respondents is still significant but a little bit
smaller, the same happening for the years of schooling coefficient. The difference of the R-squared of the
two regressions according to the type of respondent, which was 16.47 per cent, becomes 11.8 per cent,
while the difference between the years of schooling coefficient also falls from 31.53 per cent to 13.96 per
cent. When we replicate the interactive model of years of schooling with the identity of the respondent, the
education premium difference also falls.
        In sum, when we take into account both measurement error and selectivity bias issues, there is still
a significant difference in the explanatory power of education in terms of individual earnings inequality
and wage premiums, suggesting the presence of attenuation bias.

Omitted Variable
        To start addressing the problem of omitted variable bias, we take advantage of the PNAD special
supplement on intergeneration mobility, which has information on parents’ educational background.
        Information on parental education is rare to find in Brazilian household surveys and was available
in the PNAD only for the years of 1976, 1982, 1988, 1996 and more recently 2014. Some studies have used
this information to provide more precise estimates of the returns to education in Brazil. Lam and Shoeni
(1993) used the PNAD 1982 supplement and found indeed that the estimated returns falls considerably
when family background variables are included; Reis and Ramos (2011) find similar results using the
PNAD 1996. We will focus on the 1996 and 2014 supplements, which capture the recent period of labour
earnings inequality reduction in the country.


Mean Years of Schooling
        We start by looking at the results for 2014 using the full sample of individuals that responded the
PNAD questionnaire. The results show a reduction in the wage premiums when we include the education
of the parents, although the magnitude is not particularly high. We also ran a model using the highest level
of education between the two parents, finding very similar results.

         On the other hand, we have that the R-squared of the regressions increases significantly when we
include the previously omitted variables, going from 0.3777 in the most basic specification to 0.4881 when
we included both parents’ levels of education, which represents a 29 per cent increase. It is interesting to
note that for the model using both levels of education, the coefficient of the education of the father is
significantly larger than of the mother, 0.032 against 0.017. However, for the models using only one of the
levels, the coefficients are closer: 0.0396 for the father 0.0354 for the mother and 0.0351 for the highest
level.
         One concern is that the sample profile that responded the questions regarding parents’ education
differ, as the number of observations presented in the table above may suggest. This selectivity could also
bias the results found. To deal with this problem, we ran the same specifications of the model using a
reduced sample containing only the individuals who responded the question for both parents. Although the
results for the restricted sample point in the same direction as the ones for the full sample, in the sense that
there is a reduction in the wage premiums when we include information on the parents’ background, we
have that the magnitudes of the reductions are much greater.

       The results for the reduced sample show that the wage premiums fall significantly when we include
parents’ educational background variables. While the results without including parents’ education show a

wage premium of 0.1261, when we include the education of both parents it falls to 0.0961, which represents
a 24 per cent reduction. Although there is also an increase in the R-squared of the regressions when we
include the parents’ levels of education, the increase is smaller than for the estimations using the full
sample. As for the models using the full sample, the coefficient for the education of the father is larger than
for the mother when we include these two variables, 0.032 against 0.017, although the comparison between
the regressions using each of the levels separately are closer, 0.0435 against 0.0402. Note that the estimated
coefficients for the parent’s education using the restricted sample are always higher than for the full sample,
as well as the R-squared of the regressions.
        The results for 1996 show that, in spite of the estimated wage premiums being higher than in 2014,
there are also significant reductions in the returns to schooling when we include the previously omitted
variables regarding the parents’ background. Another difference in relation to the results for 2014 is that in
1996 the coefficient of the education of the mother is larger than of the father in the model using both levels
of education, 0.027 against 0.023, as well as in the models using each level separately, 0.042 against 0.038.

       To assess the changes in the wage premiums from 1996 to 2014, we piled up the PNADs for the
two years and ran the same specifications of the model described above with the inclusion of mean years
of schooling, year dummies and a variable that captures the interaction of years of schooling with the year
of 2014. Therefore, we can interpret this coefficient as the change in education returns for the period we
are analysing2.

 In 1996, all household members were assigned the question on parents’ education. In 2014, however, only one
person was randomly selected. To make the two parts of the pilled samples comparable in size, we selected a random
sample of PNAD 1996 with the same number of observations.

         The estimates point out to a reduction in the educational premium from 1996 to 2014, although the
coefficient which captures this change is not statistically significant in the most basic specification without
the education of the parents. However, when we include the information on the parents’ educational
background, the reductions in the wage premiums for the period are higher and the coefficient becomes
statistically significant. Therefore, we may be underestimating the changes if we do not consider the level
of education of the parents.
         Our next step is to focus on a richer model with cohort dummies to see how the educational premium
changes for different generations. For this purpose, we use dummies for different 5-years cohorts as well
as the interaction of these dummies with years of schooling. The model with cohorts works much better
when we include the previously omitted variables to assess the changes in the returns from 1996 to 2014,
in the sense that all the coefficients becomes statistically significant with the expected signs.
         Looking directly at the cohort effects, the reduction in the educational premium has been going on
for many decades and over several generations. In particular, we have that the fall in the educational
premium was stronger for younger cohorts and that the relation is almost monotonic, although for the
cohorts that were born between 1955 and 1959 and 1960 and 1964 the effects are not statistically different
from zero.

Years of Schooling Distribution
         We also use another specification for our model in which instead of considering the mean level of
schooling for the estimations of the wage education premiums, we use different dummies for each level of
education, more precisely from 0 to 16 years of schooling, to assess how the wage premiums differ
depending on the particular level of schooling. Following Lam and Shoeni (1993), we assess how the wage
premiums change for each level of education when we add in different ways the information on parents’
background.
         We can see clearly that, as well as in the previous model, there are reductions in the returns to
schooling when we include the information on the parents’ background. However, this disaggregated model
shows that this happens not only for the average schooling but for all levels of education, the biggest
reductions being observed when we include both parents’ levels of education. Also, we have that the biggest
reductions happen at the higher levels of education. We did the same exercise for 1996 and found similar
results.

Quantile Regressions
        To assess distributive effects in terms of income, we ran a series of quantile regressions dividing
the income distribution in vintiles. We worked with two different specifications: a basic model without
including the educational level of the parents and another including both parents’ levels of education.
        The two figures below show the distribution of the wage premiums by income vintiles for the
different specifications of the model. We estimated the models for the years of 1996 and 2014. While for
1996 we have that the returns to education are reduced when we include the information on the educational
background of the parents for the entire income distribution, for 2014 the results are somewhat different.
While in the upper part of the distribution we also see a reduction in the wage premiums when we include
the additional variables, the reverse happens in the lower part.

      When we compare the same specification across the two different years, we find that the wage

distribution and bigger at the middle of the distribution for both specifications.

   3. Intergenerational Mobility
         In this section, we go beyond estimating the impacts of parental education backgrounds on wage
premiums of the next generation and how it changes the estimation of the returns to education and use the
information available to assess how education is transmitted across generations.
         Behrman, Gaviria and Székely (2001) assessed the intergenerational mobility of education in Latin
America and compared with developed countries, finding significantly lower levels of mobility for the
LACs, which is correlated to the high inequality levels of the region. For Brazil, they use the PNAD 1996
Supplement. Ferreira and Velloso (2003) also use the PNAD 1996 to estimate levels and effects of the
transmission of education in Brazil along different dimensions, finding similar results.
         We provide new estimates of the level of intergenerational mobility of education in Brazil and how
this relation has evolved over the period from 1996 to 2014. We make use of the same information on the

parents’ education for the PNADs supplements to estimate a simple Markovian regression model of
transmission of education given by:

                                         =    +        +       +         (2)

where is the level of schooling of the individual ,       is a 2x1vector with the level of schooling of the
parents, is a 2x1 vector and is a vector of covariates. When is a scalar representing the level of
education of one of the parents, we have that it can be interpreted as a measure of the level of
intergenerational persistence of education.
        Different from Behrman, Gaviria and Székely (2001) and Gasparini et al. (2017), which use the
highest level of education between the two parents, we chose to focus on the level of education of the father
to assess how the intergenerational transmission of education changed from 1996 to 2014 (Ferreira and
Veloso 2003 follow the same strategy for 1996).
        To have a first idea on the educational mobility in Brazil, we estimated a transition matrix from
PNAD 2014 data using the level of education of the individuals and the level of education of their fathers.
We restricted our analysis to individuals aged from 15 to 59 years old.

        On the top of the distribution, we have that among fathers with an undergraduate degree,
approximately 70.66 per cent of their children achieved the same level and 7.09 per cent got a graduate
degree. Among fathers that completed high school, 45.47 per cent achieved the same level and 44.25
percent got an undergraduate degree. Therefore, it looks like there is some upward mobility even though
the persistence is still high.
        The next step is to estimate equation (2) for 1996 and 2014. We controlled for age, age squared,
race, geographic region of residence and dummies for urban areas. The results are presented below.

        While for 1996 the estimated level of persistence was approximately 0.70, the number for 2014 is
0.47, which represents a 32.85 per cent reduction. Therefore, we have that, although the intergenerational
persistence of education is still high in Brazil compared to developed countries and even other developing
ones, there was a strong reduction in its level over the last two decades.
        To assess cohort effects, we follow a similar strategy as presented on the estimation of wage
premiums. We also piled up the PNADs 1996 and 2014 and use dummies for different 5-years cohorts, as
well as the interaction of these dummies with the father’s years of schooling variable to capture how the
persistence changed across different generations.
        The results show two main findings. First, younger cohorts are more educated than older ones, as
we can see by the estimated coefficients for each cohort presented in the figure below.

cohorts, and the relation is monotonic.

        We finish this section by estimating quantile regressions to see how the intergenerational persistence
in education change along the income distribution. Again, we divided the income distribution in vintiles
and estimated the level of persistence for each one considering the education of the father.
        The results for 1996 show that the persistence is smaller at the bottom part of the income distribution
and increases as we move to the top of the distribution, reaching a maximum level of 0.81 for the 70th
percentile. Then, it starts to fall until it reaches in the 95th percentile the same level of persistence as in the
10th percentile.

for the richest individuals.

   4. Conclusions
        The paper has two main objectives. First, to provide new estimates of the level and evolution of the
returns to education in Brazil based on a recently launched dataset that contains a rich and unique variety
of characteristics which include family educational background. This information permits us to address
some important econometric issues regarding omitted variable and measurement error biases. Second, we
assess how parents’ education affect the educational level of their children and how the intergenerational
mobility of education has evolved over the last years.
        Regarding measurement error, the empirical strategy is to make use of the information of who
responded the PNAD questionnaire but controlling for availability biases. We find evidence of attenuation
bias which reduces mean returns from education between 14 per cent and 31.5 per cent. On the other hand,
the omitting parents’ education information also accounting for selectivity issues reduces the premium
estimates by 24 percent.
        Perhaps more importantly than the cross sectional estimates for 2014 cited above is the possibility
of comparing omitted bias impacts across a period of sharp earnings inequality fall observed between 1996
and 2014. The fall of education premium turns out to be heavily underestimated when we do not take into
account family background. The highest fall of returns occurred in intermediary levels of education and
income.
        In the second part of the paper we assess how parents’ education affect the educational outcomes
of their children and how the intergenerational mobility of education has evolved over the last years. We
find a reduction on the ntergenerational persistence of education from 0.7 to 0.47 between 1996 and 2014.
Comparing directly the coefficients for the two years, we have that, except for the first two vintiles, the
persistence is smaller for 2014 in comparison with 1996, specially at the middle and upper part of the
income distribution. That is, we have stronger reductions in the intergenerational persistence of education
for the richest individuals.
        Finally, cohort effects regarding intergenerational mobility also show that the fall in the persistence
of education is also stronger for younger cohorts, which coincides with the fall of education premiums.
