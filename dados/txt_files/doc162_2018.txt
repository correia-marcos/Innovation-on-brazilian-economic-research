ABSTRACT: This paper reports the results of an application using an interregional input-output matrix
for Morocco together with regional information on water consumption by sectors. We develop a trade-
based index that reveals the relative water use intensities associated with specific interregional and
international trade flows. We estimate, for each flow associated with each origin-destination pair,
measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. We add
to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the subnational perspective in the case
study of a country that shows a “climate divide”: while a great part of the southern territory is located
in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part is relatively more privileged with
access to this natural resource. Furthermore, we compare that Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity to
similar metrics related to the use of other natural resources.

1. Introduction

        Considered as one of the most poorly endowed countries in water resources, Morocco has
intimately linked its economic and social development to the control of its natural resources. The
country has developed strategies and policies aiming at the best management and valorization of
such resources. It has built, in the last decades, a large system of hydropower infrastructure
consisting of approximately 139 large dams, with a storage capacity of more than 17 billion m 3,
and several transfer systems that allow the physical transposition of water to the driest areas
(Ministry of Water, 2016).
        These strategies have played a key role in food, water, and energy security for the
population, particularly through improved access to drinking water and hydroelectric power, as
well as protection against floods and droughts. Nevertheless, good governance of water resources
requires continuing attention in Morocco, especially in the face of a significant increase in the
demand for water and its multiple uses in the context of a growing population and an expanding
economy (Global Nexus, 2017). Moreover, adding to the long-term changes to recent dry
conditions in Morocco, global climate change is projected to increase the frequency, length and
severity of drought episodes in the country, directly and indirectly compromising the living
standards of the population (Esper et al., 2007; Masih et al., 2014; Imani et al., 2014; Roson and
Sartori, 2015).
        In addition to physical relocation processes, interregional transfers of water resources also
take place virtually through trade flows (Allan, 1993). Differences in water availability across the
country enhance regional comparative advantage in resource-intensive sectors, such as agriculture,
in water-rich areas (Wichelns, 2004; Duchin and López-Morales, 2012). Such differences are
revealed in the structure of interregional trade, in which virtual water flows are associated with the
resources embedded in the production chain of the traded goods.
        Research on water accounting, mainly related to international trade flows, has boosted in
the last few years with the development of worldwide input-output systems and the stronger
concern with resources availability in the context of global climate change (Hoekstra and Hung,
2002; Dietzenbacher and Velázquez, 2007; Hoekstra and Chapagain, 2009; Feng et al., 2011;
Daniels et al., 2011; Lenzen et al., 2013a; Tamea et al., 2016). Accountability of the pressure on
the use of the world’s natural resources has reached the political debate, as attempts to characterize
countries according to their historical, current and expected role played in this process has reopened
political fissures (Victor et al., 2014). Similarly to nations, regions within countries can also be
characterized by their pressure on the demand for natural resources. As shown by Hoekstra and
Chapagain (2009), local water depletion is often closely tied to the structure of the global economy.
For regions within a country, the national economy adds another layer to the relevant structural
hierarchy to understand resources uses (Zhang et al., 2016; Visentin, 2017).
        This paper reports on the results of an application with an interregional input-output matrix
for Morocco which allows calculating the total volume of water that is directly and indirectly
embodied in specific trade flows. Thus, the concept of virtual water in this paper is defined within
the input-output framework, which determines the virtual water content in one monetary unit of a
given product (Dietzenbacher and Velázquez, 2007). The input-output system was developed as
part of a technical cooperation initiative involving researchers from the Regional and Urban
Economics Lab at the University of São Paulo (NEREUS), in Brazil, and the OCP Policy Center
and the Department of Economic Studies and Financial Forecast (DESFF), under the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, both in Morocco (Haddad et al., 2017). A fully specified interregional input-
output database was estimated for 2013, considering 20 sectors in 12 Moroccan regions (IIOM-
MOR). Using this database together with information on water consumption by sectors, we develop
a trade-based index that reveals the relative water use intensities associated with interregional and
international trade flows. We estimate, for each flow originated in one of the Moroccan regions,
measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. The

parsimonious approach proposed in Los et al. (2016), based on “hypothetical extraction”, serves as
the methodological anchor. Results point to different ratios of water use to value added, not only
when aggregate domestic trade flows are compared to Moroccan international exports, but also to
differences within the country.
         We add to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the intra-country
perspective in the case study of a country that shows a “climate divide”: while a great part of the
southern territory is located in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part
is relatively more privileged with access to this natural resource. Few studies have analyzed virtual
water flows in Morocco considering different perspectives. Schyns and Hoekstra (2014) carried
out a detailed Water Footprint Assesment for Morocco. Using a bottom-up water footprint
accounting approach, the authors were able to map the water footprint of different activities at river
basin and monthly scale, distinguishing between surface- and groundwater. Boudhar et al. (2017)
developed their study relying on a top-down approach based on input-output analysis. The authors
used a national input–output model of water use to analyze the relationships between economic
sectors and water resources use in Morocco (i.e. direct water use) as well as the intersectoral water
relationships (i.e. indirect water use). The results provided insights on a categorization of sectors
that exhibits higher direct water use and those with higher indirect water use. From a
methodological standpoint, the differences between bottom-up and top-down approaches are due
to inter-sectoral effects (Feng et al., 2011). While bottom-up approaches do not fully trace
intersectoral linkages, top-down approaches, based on input-output techniques, are able to calculate
the water footprint by tracing the whole supply chains. In this paper we have opted to follow a top-
down approach, adding to previous work the integrated water-economic analysis of supply chains
in an explicit regional (sub-national) setting.
         In what follows, Section 2 presents different dimensions of regional disparities in Morocco,
considering the geography of water and the spatial economic structure of the country. Section 3
describes the methodology to be used in Section 4 to measure interregional trade in value added
and water in Morocco, while Section 5 concludes.

2. Dimensions of Regional Disparities in Morocco
2.1. The Geography of Water Resources

        Located in Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean in the north and the Atlantic
Ocean in the west, Morocco is characterized by diversified reliefs ranging from the mountains in
the Rif and the Atlas, passing through plains and central plateaus, and ending in the south in a vast
desert area. The heterogeneity observed at the level of the reliefs in Morocco has predestined the
country to have a temperate climate marked by contrasts in space and time, and associated with
increasing scarcity of water resources.
        These natural physical constraints have forced the country to create the capability of storing
water during periods of abundant rainfall for use during periods of scarcity, and to transfer water
from the surplus basins of the northwest to the deficit basins of the center and the south. This
mechanism allows the government to design an integral development plan for all regions of the
country taking into consideration different dimensions of regional disparities. Moreover, these
natural complexities are exacerbated by excessive evaporation, extensive evapotranspiration and
also frequent periods of droughts that result from the impacts of climate variability, which tend to
become even more intense in the context of global climate change.
        Marked by evident space-temporal variability, rainfall in Morocco is gradually becoming
scarce, going eastwards in the Mediterranean zone and towards the south in the Atlantic zone. In
fact, the average annual national rainfall varies from 500-1000 mm in the northwest part of the
country to less than 100 mm in the arid zones: (i) greater than 800 mm in the most rich area in
terms of water resources located in the northwest; (ii) from 600 to 800 mm in the north and the
Atlas zone; (iii) from 400 to 600 mm in the Sebou, Bouregreg and Oum Rbia areas; (iv) from 200

to 400 mm in the Tensift, Souss Massa and the Oriental areas; and (v) less than 200 mm in the
southern Atlas areas and the Sahara.
        According to the inventory of water resources in Morocco, it is estimated that 22 billion
cubic meters of water can be mobilized of which 18 billion are surface water and 4 billion are
extracting from groundwater (Table 1). In addition, close to 60% of the country’s mobilizable
surface water resources are located in the Atlantic and central basins, which account for less than
one fifth of the territory. In contrast, the Saharan basins, which cover half of the country, account
for less than 6% of total surface water availability.

       Finally, as far as groundwater is concerned, the exploitable potential of groundwater
amounts to about 4 billion m3 per year. Throughout the Moroccan territory, more than 78
groundwater wells are identified. These water resources constitute an important part of the national
water heritage and sometimes represent the only water resources of the desert regions. Although
very rare, these resources participate actively to the economic development of the Saharan areas.

2.2. The Geography of Economic Activity

        The use of a regionalization based on river basins is fundamental for studies dealing with
impact assessment of the use of water resources on their availability to extract measures of
sustainability (Visentin, 2017). Nonetheless, regionalization issues arise when one attempts to
integrate other quantifiable dimensions for which data are collected under different geographical
definitions. This is the case for regional economic statistics in Morocco, which are available for
administrative divisions whose limits differ from those of the river basins. Given the twelve-region
setting of the IIOM-MOR, and the nine-basin setting of the Moroccan watershed system, a one-to-
one mapping is not available. Thus, a different regional perspective, based on administrative
regions, will permeate the forthcoming analysis, to be also used throughout the rest of the paper.
        Information on the regional distribution of population and GDP (Table 2) shows Grand
Casablanca-Settat as the prime region of the country. It concentrates 20% of the population and
30% of national GDP. Asymmetries in the distribution of the productive activity, with the primacy
of Casablanca, serve to strengthen existing competitive advantages. Higher productivity levels are
perceived mainly in the two largest urban agglomerations of the country, which present higher
GDP shares than population shares. In a broader territorial context, the presence of other relevant
industrial areas outside Casablanca reveals the economic core of the Moroccan economy

        Table 3 presents the regional output shares for the regions in Morocco. Casablanca
dominates the national production, with a share of 35.7% in total output, followed by Rabat
(13.0%), Marrakech (9.9%), Fès-Meknès (9.2%) and Tanger (8.8%). The regional output shares by
sectors in Morocco reveal some evidence of spatial concentration of specific activities: agriculture
in Fès-Meknès, Marrakech, Rabat, Casablanca, and Béni (69.7% of total output); fishing in Souss-
Massa, Dakhla-Oued Eddahab, Guelmin-Oued Noun and Laayoune-Sakia Le Hamra (79.0%);
mining in Béni and Marrakech (78.0%), manufacturing in Casablanca, where at least 50% of the
output is generated for each of the sectors. Some regions play important roles in the production of
specific manufacturing sectors, such as food industry in Souss-Massa (12.6%) and Fès-Meknès
(9.9%); textile and leather in Tanger (21.3%) and Fès-Meknès (11.3%); and mechanical, metal and
electrical products in Tanger (26.4%). Services, in general, are concentrated in Rabat and
Casablanca. However, Marrakech and Souss-Massa concentrate the major part of tourism services
(36.8% and 26.4%, respectively).
        Table 4 shows the sectoral shares in regional output, revealing the important role of some
activities in relatively specialized regions: the dominant role of agriculture in Drâa-Tafilalet (27.5%
of total regional output), Béni (25.6%) and Fès-Meknès (21.7%); fishing in Dahla-Oued Eddahab
(38.6%); mining in Béni (21.%); food industry in Souss-Massa (21.1%); and the relevance of the
public administration in the more remote regions of the south: Guelmin-Oued Noun (28.0%),
Laayoune-Sakia Le Hamra (27.7%) and Dakhla-Oued Eddahab (20.7%).
        Relative regional specialization can also be assessed by the calculation of the sectoral
location quotients, as presented in Table 5. The highlighted cells identify sectors relatively
concentrated in specific regions, i.e. sectors for which their share in total regional output is greater

3. Methodology

        The analysis in the previous section has revealed distinct spatial regimes associated with
both the geography of water resources and the geography of economic activity in Morocco. On one
hand, the climate divide, heavily influenced by the physical barrier established by the Atlas
mountain range, affects regional water availability, creating regionally differentiated comparative
advantage on water-resource-intensive sectors. On the other hand, the regional distribution of
economic activity and population creates a complex structure of supply and demand in space that
helps shaping the geography of trade flows and domestic value chains (Meng et al., 2017).
        In a context in which interregional physical transfers of water do not suffice to respond to
specific regional needs, what role do virtual water trade flows play? Coming up with appropriate
methods to measure interregional trade in water may be deem important for water management in
a country like Morocco, characterized by a very heterogeneous availability across its regions. Thus,
in this Section, we describe the methodology to be applied in the calculation of our trade-based
index of water intensity. It takes into consideration important elements of an integrated
interregional system and the demand of natural resources, namely information on the adopted
technology by different sectors in the form of input-output linkages, the specific regional economic
structures, the structure of interregional and international trade flows, and information on water
consumption by sectors.

3.1. Background

         Los et al. (2016) have proposed a decomposition of gross exports based on the “hypothetical
extraction” (HE) methodology, which allows verifying how much domestic value added is included
in a country’s exports. They have provided a measurement of domestic value added in exports
based on global and national input-output tables.
         In the case of national interregional input-output tables, with n regions, the ideal framework
to evaluate the domestic value added in exports would be to have a global input-output table where
the national system is inserted in a global multi-regional model. However, such a system would
demand a large amount of information, such as trade flows from each sector in each region to each
sector in the Rest of the World (RoW) and vice versa. Thus, given the scarcity of these data, we
will follow an alternative approach in which we will consider the RoW as an exogenous region,
i.e. as a column vector in the final demand of a national interregional system.
         Following the methodology presented by Los et al. (2016), we will then make the
calculation of domestic value added in exports (DVA) based on a national interregional input-
output system with exports to the RoW exogenously specified. Furthermore, by the same logic, we
will be able to measure domestic traded water in exports (DTW). Finally, using both measures, we
will calculate a Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity.

3.2. Measurement of Domestic Value Added in Exports
           The input-output model can be expressed by

    𝐱 = 𝐀𝐱 + 𝐟                                                                            (1)
    𝐱 = (𝐈 − 𝐀)−1 𝐟 = 𝐋𝐟                                                                 (2)

where 𝐱 and 𝐟 are the vectors of gross output and final demand; 𝐀 is a matrix with the input
coefficients (aij ); 𝐈 is the identity matrix; and 𝐋 is the Leontief inverse.2
        Considering a national interregional input-output model with n different regions and the
RoW as a column vector in the final demand, (1) and (2) can be represented as

        From (5) and (6), we can define the domestic value added in exports (DVA) from region 1

        Similarly, we can attribute the amount of domestic value added in exports from region 1 to
all regions (2, 3, …, n), and from each region to the n-regions (1, 2, …, n), excluding itself. We
can also attribute the DVA from each region to the RoW. In this sense, in an interregional system

3.3. Measurement of Domestic Traded Water in Exports

        In order to attribute the amount of water in exports from region 1 to region n, we consider,
similarly to (6), a hypothetical world where region 1 does not export anything to region n, which

value added in exports (DVA) and domestic total traded water in exports (DTW). The index
calculation considers three steps. First, we calculate the relative importance of each domestic value
added in export (𝐼 𝐷𝑉𝐴 ) inside the whole economy by computing the ratio of each DVA to the sum
of all of them, expressed as

       The 𝑇𝑊𝐼 can be interpreted as follows:

(i) if greater than 1, in that particular trade flow the region is more intensive in domestic total
traded water in exports than in domestic value added in exports; and
(ii) if lower than 1, the opposite.

4. Analysis
4.1. Data

        The methodology described in Section 3 relies on the use of an interregional input-output
system linked to a water accounting system. We illustrate the calculation of the TWI using data for
Morocco. We use the IIOM-MOR, a fully specified interregional input-output database estimated
for 2013, together with total water sectoral use coefficients from Eora (Lenzen et al., 2012, 2013b).3
Despite the fact that water consumption within a given activity differs across regions in Morocco
(Schyns and Hoekstra, 2014), data availability precludes the use of regionally differentiated
sectoral use coefficients in this study.
        In Eora, total water use (in m3), or total water footprint4, is available for 26 Moroccan
sectors5, and the information includes different components, namely, (i) water footprint by crop
demand; (ii) water footprint of grazing (green water); (iii) water footprint of animal supply (blue);
and (iv) water footprint of industrial production and water footprint of domestic water supply
(grey). The consolidated information is presented in Table 10, in which the adjusted coefficients
are presented in m3 per million DHS. The top sector in terms of direct water use is Agriculture,
forestry, hunting, related activities (A00), whose total water use is mainly concentrated in the crop
water use component. Food industry and tobacco (D01) is also a heavy user, with important shares
of crop water and blue water use. Other manufacturing, excluding petroleum refining (D05) is also
an important user, dominated by the blue water use component.

  “The term ‘virtual water’ refers exclusively to indirect consumption, while the term ‘water footprint’ includes both
direct use (e.g. turning on the faucet at home or drinking imported Perrier) and indirect use.” (Lenzen et al., 2013a).

  The version of the model used in this paper is Eora26 MRIO, which aggregates all countries to a common 26-sector
classification and converts the supply-use tables from the full Eora MRIO to symmetric product-by-product IO tables

4.2. Results

        We have first computed the values of Table 6 (DTW), with the domestic total traded water
in interregional and international exports originating in each of the twelve Moroccan regions. To
grasp the relevance of each type of water use, we have decomposed total water use into its four
different components according to information in Table 10. We have generated the results based
on equations (16) and (17) by using such information to construct the row vectors of type t sectoral
water use in region r, 𝐰rt . Aggregate results are presented in Figure 3 showing that the overall use
of domestic resources embodied in trade flows is mainly associated with crop water requirements
(84.06% of total traded water), followed by the use of ground or surface water, i.e. blue water, that
accounts for 15.38% of the total.

       We can map the results obtained from Table 66 to visualize the geography of domestic
traded water in Morocco. Figure 4 depicts the “shipments” of virtual water from each origin to all
destinations, both domestic and foreign. It also shows the magnitude of the flows with lines of
proportional thickness.

         We have also computed the values of the elements presented in Table 5 (DVA), which
provide the estimates of the value added content in each export flow originating in Moroccan
regions. Table 11 presents the aggregate results for both regional traded value added and regional
total traded water embodied in regional exports, by main destinations. Overall, the amount of total
water embodied in interregional exports surpasses that of foreign exports in the Moroccan case in

    The forthcoming analysis is concentrated in total water use.

                                                                 15
a ratio of 6.4 to 1, i.e. for each m3 of virtual water in foreign exports, 6.4 m3 were traded within the
country. Nonetheless, this ratio varies across exporting regions, ranging from 0.3 in Dakhla-Oued
Eddahab, and 0.9 in Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra, both regions in the Sahara, to 16.5 in Grand
Casablanca-Settat, and 28.2 in Rabat-Salé-Kénitra, the two largest urban agglomerations in
Morocco.
        Comparing the regional share of value added in total exports to the regional share of total
traded water, we see that the contributions to value added by Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra, Dakhla-
Oued Eddahab, Grand Casablanca-Settat, Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, and Rabat-Salé-Kénitra
exceed their respective contributions to water. As described in Section 2, these regions are
associated with relative scarcity of water resources due to their structural characteristics. Relative
abundance (or scarcity) of factors of production may arise from both supply and demand
considerations. In our case, the scarcity of water in the Sahara explains the results for Laayoune
and Dakhla. In the case of the second subset of regions, associated with the cities of Casablanca,
Tanger, and Rabat, on one hand, the relative scarcity of water is associated with high levels of
demand due to urbanization and the important presence of manufacturing activities. On the other
hand, these regions face strong agglomeration economies that potentially generate high
productivity levels of capital and labor, partially explaining, from the supply side, the relative
higher value added shares in trade flows originating in these areas.
        This result is in agreement with the Heckscher-Ohlin model, which predicts patterns of trade
and production based on the factor endowments of a trading region: each region exports the good
that makes relatively intensive use of its relatively abundant factor. Differences in factor
endowments lead to differences in autarky prices, generating comparative advantage to regions
where factors are relatively abundant. Since goods can be traded more cheaply than factors – factors
are usually more costly to move – trade can at least partly alleviate factor scarcity. Thus, regions
can import their scarce factor services embodied in goods. This seems to be the case in domestic
trade within Morocco, when comparing the content of water in regional exports to that of aggregate
payments to capital and labor (value added).

        The pattern of water content of trade within Morocco can also be associated with the
physical concepts of “water loss” and “water savings”, discussed in Hoekstra and Chapagain (2008,
p. 39). Accordingly, whereas import of goods intensive in the use of water (see Table 10) implies
regional water resources are saved, export of such goods entails the loss of regional water resources.
That is, water used for producing commodities that are consumed in other regions is no longer
available for in-region purposes. Figure 5 presents the physical balance of traded water by
Moroccan region. The regions with the largest net water savings (deficit with other regions) are
Grand Casablanca-Settat and Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, followed by the two regions in the
direct area of influence of the Saharan basins, namely Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra and Dakhla-Oued
Eddahab. On the other hand, the regions with the largest net water loss (surplus with other regions)
are in the direct area of influence of the water-rich basins of the Atlantic with a relevant presence
of agricultural activities, namely Béni Mellal-Khénifra and Fès-Meknès.

         Finally, based on the specification presented in Table 9, we have computed the Trade-Based
Index of Water Intensity (TWI), which reveals the relative water use intensities associated with
specific interregional and international export flows. We estimate, for trade flows associated with
each origin-destination pair, measures of trade in value added and trade in water that were further
used to calculate our index. The results are presented in Table 12 and point to different ratios across
flows of share in total traded water to the respective share in total traded value added. Different
patterns appear not only when international export flows are compared to domestic export flows,
but when looking at trade flows within the country.
         The regional patterns of relative factor content in trade revealed by the TWI can be grasped
by reading Table 12 in two different perspectives. First, going through the rows, one can verify that
values for the TWI smaller than one relative to interregional trade prevail in regions that present
relative scarcity of water resources – urban agglomerations of Rabat (R4) and Casablanca (R6), as
well as the desert areas in the southern part of the country. In those cases, trade flows are relatively
more concentrated in terms of value added than in water content. Second, as we look at the column
results, we can conclude that (i) more water-intensive trade flows directed to the areas under the
influence of the Sahara basins are spatially concentrated in Fès-Meknès, Béni Mellal-Khénifra and
Drâa-Tafilalet, that benefit from their relative abundance of water resources and their strategic
location to access the southern areas of the country; (ii) except for sales from Casablanca and Rabat,
domestic trade within the “fish” area is dominated by more water intensive flows; and (iii) despite
the documented fact that Morocco imports water in virtual form, more than it exports, so that in
effect it partially depends on water resources from other countries (Hoekstra and Chapagain, 2009,
p. 73), the above-unity TWI results in the RoW column suggest that international exports from Fès-
Meknès, Béni Mellal-Khénifra, Drâa-Tafilalet, and Souss-Massa are responsible, in relative terms,
to put more pressure on the use of domestic water resources

5. Epilogue: Natural Resources Intensity

        We have focused the preceding analysis on the relative intensity in the use of water
resources in regional supply chains, focusing on the water content in bilateral export flows from
Moroccan regions. In what follows, we take structural elements of the Moroccan economy a step
further in our analysis. The proposed index, TWI, can be compared to similar metrics related to
other natural resources. Economic activity demand different scarce resources whose availability
varies across regions within a country. By using information on sectoral use of other natural
resources, the integrated water-economic analysis of regional supply chains that we have discussed
can be expanded. In so doing, we add another layer of complexity to a system of resources
management, as other trade-offs may appear involving different regional actors. Thus, the
forthcoming final analysis justifies the need for coordinated resources management systems.
        To illustrate this point, we will focus on CO2 emissions associated with energy use in the
production process. Similarly to the calculation of the TWI, we calculate the TEI, the trade-based
index of CO2 emission intensity, using information for the sectoral CO2 emission coefficients from
Eora. Results are presented in Table 13.

        The next step is to compare the TWI with the TEI. In this analysis, instead of examining
differences in each single O-D pair, we compute the two indices for exports aggregated by the two
main destinations, i.e. other Moroccan regions and other countries. We then present the results in
Figure 6. In each of the scatter plots, the size of the “bubble” is proportional to the value added
content in each export flow. The two axes cross at unity, the threshold value for both indices that
indicate whether a particular trade flow from the region is more intensive in domestic total traded
water (CO2 emissions) than in domestic value added. Thus, the interpretation of the location of the
“bubbles” follows: (i) NE quadrant – relatively more intensive in the use of both natural resources;
(ii) SE quadrant – relatively more intensive in the use of water resources; (iii) SW quadrant –
relatively less intensive in the use of both natural resources; and (iv) NW quadrant – relatively
more intensive in the use of energy resources.
        We can divide the analysis in two parts. First, regional exports to other regions of the
country reveal the following: (i) domestic sales from Tanger (R1) are relatively more intensive in
the use of both water and energy resources; (iii) exports from the Sahara regions (R11 and R12)
present relative low levels of water use and emissions; moreover, trade flows from the main selling
region (Casablanca – R6) are dominated by relative stronger value added generation when
compared to their relative use of natural resources; (iii) the relative “clean” export flows, mainly
from regions in the “fish” territory are relatively more intensive in the use of water resources; and
(iv) sales originated in Rabat (R4) are more intensive in the use of energy inputs that generate
higher CO2 emissions.

        Finally, in the case of international exports, there appears a negative relationship between
the TWI and the TEI, evidencing another trade-off. The main export flows in value added terms
are concentrated in the NW quadrant, revealing a relative higher intensity in the use of CO2
emissions generating energy inputs. On the other hand, export flows with low contribution to value
added generation, mainly located in the SE quadrant, use water resources relatively more
intensively.
