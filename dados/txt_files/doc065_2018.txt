Although Post-Keynesian growth models have been already extensively extended, the issue of personal
inequality has only recently started to be dealt with. The strategy, however, has been the insertion of more
functional classes or the observation of intra-class inequality. While empirically credible, these strategies are
formally complex and hamper the spread of their conclusions, which are normally of important changes in the
main results of traditional models. In this context, this paper proposes a simpler formulation of the problem,
both as a didactic introduction and as a way of disseminating the discussion. More than displaying complex
mathematical formulations, the paper aims to provide intuitive and graphical tools for understanding and
reading the problem of personal distribution on post-Keynesian growth models. The objective will be pursued
by construing the model from the tautological fact that the total income of the economy may be represented
by the sum of the income of all individuals in that economy. The functional form representing this sum is the
Pareto distribution. This strategy provides two different interpretations for the model: class-conflict and
earnings-composition.

Introduction

         Since the initial formulations of the Cambridge model of economic growth - normally ascribed to the
works of Robinson (1962), Kaldor (1957) and Kalecki (1954) - post-Keynesian models have traveled a long
way through numerous different routes. One of the longest roads traveled has been on the ‚Äúgrowth regimes‚Äù
route: after Rowthorn‚Äôs (1981) and Dutt‚Äôs (1984) exclusive wage-led results, Bhaduri and Marglin (1990)
demonstrated that demand-led models might present at least two possible growth regimes: wage-led and
profit-led. From then on, post Keynesians heartily faced the task of testing empirically Bhaduri and Marglin‚Äôs
ideas2, as well as the burden of extending the original formulation theoretically3.
         This paper joins the task of developing the model theoretically. However, instead of joining the
community at the edge of the route, the present formulation intends to demonstrate a sideway that may have
been condoned when previous travelers took the road: inserting personal inequality on the model. Leaving the
analogy behind, the paper rather than reformulate based on sophisticated current formulations of post-
Keynesian models, will review the most basic presentation with the minor inclusion of individuality. As a
result, two different perspectives for interpreting the model will be analyzed and, most importantly, personal
inequality will be inserted without unnecessary complications.
         Concerns have been rising recently around the issue of personal inequality. Piketty and Saez (2003,
2006), for instance, discuss the increasing inequality of income in English speaking countries. More recently,
Piketty‚Äôs (2014) extensive work has received worldwide attention for its disturbing findings, suggesting a
spread of inequality. Although his theoretical proposals may be controversial, the wide analysis of data
suggests at least that the topic must be urgently faced.
         The fact is that, although at this point post-Keynesians may be far on the road, only recently attention
has started to be paid towards personal inequality in ‚Äúgrowth regime‚Äù models. Palley (2014, 2016), Carvalho
and Rezai (2014) and Tavani and Vasudevan (2014) present some interesting contributions to the debate. Still,
while refined on their theoretical formulations and empirically trustworthy, none of the current models intends
to fill the gap of a comprehensive introduction to the issue of personal inequality on post-Keynesian growth
models. Consequently, the formulations miss simpler presentations of the problem, what may be hampering
the burgeoning of the discussion. The point is that most of these models have important conclusions
concerning the reliability of canonical ‚Äúgrowth regime‚Äù models and they still do not reach a wider audience.
         In this context, this paper proposes a simpler formulation of the problem, both as a didactic introduction
and as a way of disseminating the discussion. The proposed formulation, as it will be demonstrated, is versatile
and is a viable mode of rereading more complex formulations. More than displaying complex mathematical
formulations, the paper aims to provide intuitive and graphical tools for understanding and reading the problem
of personal distribution on post-Keynesian growth models.
         This objective will be pursued in the following manner. First, the next section will present the canonical
kaleckian model, as found on Post-Keynesian textbooks. Next, the inclusion of individuality will be discussed,
presenting two different perspectives for reading the model with individuals: earnings-composition and class-
conflict. Finally, personal inequality will be inserted into the model through a Pareto distribution and two
closures of the model will be presented. In the last section, concluding remarks will be declared.

The canonical model

        To review how post-Keynesian models may include personal distribution in their formalizations, it is
interesting to remember the canonical version of the kaleckian model for a closed economy. The canonical

have been Hein and Vogel‚Äôs (2007), Naastepad and Storm‚Äôs (2006, 2007) and Onaram and Galanis‚Äôs (2012).

  Some of the most commonly cited extensions are: open economy (Blecker 1989, 2011), Harrodian (Skott 1989, 2010), Marxian
(Shaikh 2007, 2009) and Sraffian (Serrano 1995). For theoretical reconstructions of the history of post Keynesian models see:
Hein (2014), Lavoie (2016), Taylor (2004) and Stockhammer (1999)

formalization of post-Keynesian growth models may be presented in numerous forms and is didactically
exposed in textbooks such as Hein‚Äôs (2014) and Lavoie‚Äôs (2016). Here, a simple version based on such
expositions will be presented.
        To begin with, the tautological definition that describes the income of the economy (ùëå ) as the sum of
the total income of its classes, capitalists (P) and workers (W)4, represents the most basic foundation of the
model and is specified in the following manner:

                                                       ùëå =ùëÉ+ùëä

                                            ùëå      ùëÉ ùëä
                                              = 1 = + = ùúã + (1 ‚àí ùúã)
                                            ùëå      ùëå ùëå

         As usual in post-Keynesian frameworks, ùúã formalizes the share of profits of the economy. Normally,
kaleckian models opt for a presentation that defines the functional shares of income as a function of the
exogenous mark-up rate of the economy. While offering an interesting economic interpretation to the model,
mathematically this means endogenizing the profit share as a function of the exogenous mark-up parameter.
In fact, there is no mathematical difference in setting exogenously the mark up rate or directly the profit-share.
Consequently, the reasons for opting for one or another are mostly related to interpretation. Here, however,
the objective is to endogenize ùúã as a function of personal distribution. Therefore, it seems preferable to
condone the mark-up determination of functional distribution in order to maintain the clarity of the exposition.
Thus, an exogenous direct determination of the profit-share stands as the base of the current modeling.
         Following the tautological definition, to represent the supply side of the economy, the model assumes
that each class has a unique propensity to save. Therefore, the savings of the economy (S) are the sum of the
saved share of the income of each class given the defined propensities to save. As a result, the weighted sum
of the propensities to save of each class - where the weights are the shares of profits and wages of the economy
- describe the economy‚Äôs propensity to save (s). These definitions are demonstrated according to the following
equations:

                                                     ùëÜ = ùë†ùëù ùëÉ+ ùë†ùë§ W

                                                              ùëÉ        W
                                                 ùëÜ/ùëå = ùë†ùëù (ùëå)+ ùë†ùë§ ( Y )

                                                  ùë† = ùë†ùëù ùúã+ ùë†ùë§ (1 ‚àí ùúã)

        Usually, the propensity to save of the capitalist class (ùë†ùëù ) is higher than the propensity to save of
workers (ùë†ùë§ ). It may even be assumed that the workers do not save, resulting in a model where the propensity
to save of the capitalist class totally characterizes the propensity to save of the economy. Although the model
becomes didactically more manageable on the presence of this assumption, there is no unnecessary
complication in assuming two distinct propensities to save. Moreover, when personal inequality take part in
the model, distinguishable propensities between classes will be demonstrated to be an important part of the
post-Keynesian framework. Hence, this shall be the assumption henceforward.
        The equations above presented are presented in level. To solve for the equilibrium of the economy,
growth rates must be determined. The procedure is simple. The model is normalized, applying the usual ruse
of dividing the savings equation by the stock of capital of the economy (K), in order to present the growth rate
of the savings. Thus, the following equation expounds the long run growth of the supply side of the economy
(ùëîùë† ):

 Evidently, any number of classes could be included in the model. Canonical Kaleckian models, however, assume only two,
following Marxian ideas.

      The growth rate is a function of the propensity to save of the economy and the utilization rate of the

should define the utilization rate. However, it is implicitly assumed for simplification that the potential
                                                                                                              ùëåùëåùëù     ùëåùëåùëù     ùëå
productivity of capital is constant. Consequently, the actual productivity of capital (ùë¢ = ùëå                        = ùêæùëå = ùêæ) may
                                                                                                               ùëùùêæ       ùëù
describe the potential outcome of the economy.
        Considering that in a post-Keynesian framework supply and demand are individually determined, an
investment function must be described as well. For this, kaleckian models assumed through time at least three
different formulations (Stockhammer 1999). Here, the basic investment function that is denoted by the
                                                                                                                                  ùëÉ
independent animal spirit of individuals (ùëé), the rate of capacity of utilization (ùë¢) and the profit rate (ùëü = ùêæ =
ùëÉùëå
     = ùúãùë¢) will be assumed5:
ùëåùêæ


                                                       ùëîùëñ = ùëé + ùëèùë¢ + ùëêùúãùë¢

       The solution for the model, assuming a closed economy, occurs when supply and demand meet in the
long run. In other words, the model is solved for the equilibrium when the growth rates of savings and
investment equalize.

                                                              ùëîùë† = ùëîùëñ

Therefore, the following result delineates the economy‚Äôs capacity utilization that settles the equilibrium of
supply and demand:

                                                   ùëé                 ùëé
                                       ùë¢‚àó =             =
                                              ùë† ‚àí ùëè ‚àí ùëêùúã [ùúã(ùë†ùëù + c -ùë†ùë§ )] ‚àí ùëè + ùë†ùë§

       This simple presentation neglects the existence of personal distributions completely. However, this
does not imply that the model has not implicitly assumptions about the personal distribution of income. The
following section will demonstrate how the model may be reinterpreted with the inclusion of individuality
without altering any of the results of the model.

Individuality in Post-Keynesian Growth Models

         By definition, the inclusion of personal distribution in the kaleckian model of growth entails the
necessity of modeling individual behaviors. The canonical post-Keynesian model, however, is an aggregate
model where individuality plays no significant role. As a result, the inclusion of an individual point of view
alters the interpretation of the model, even though, as is going to be observed, the results may remain the same.




5
  Given the theoretical aspect of the paper, there is not the necessity of advocating in favor of this functional forms. In fact, an
interesting exercise would be to apply the subsequent formulations to different investment functions.
                                                                  4
        Two interpretations will be presented in the next subsections6. However, in order to stick only to the
presentation of the interpretations, the individual perspectives will be presented assuming a homogeneous
behavior among individuals, which paradoxically means that the individuals behave as a group.
        First, the inclusion of an individual perspective in which the profit share is formalized through the
number of individuals in each class of the economy will be delineated. In this perspective, class-conflict is
maintained and occurs through increasing or decreasing the numbers of individuals in the classes of the
economy.
        Second, the individual perspective allows an unusual interpretation of the model, where instead of
distinct classes, different types of income are introduced. In this framework, class-conflict is renounced since
all individuals pertain to the same class. The results remain the same, although the interpretation may be
altered in a somewhat high degree.

Class-conflict perspective

        The inclusion of personal distribution in the model follows the same tautological definition that
bolsters the canonical model with a minor reinterpretation. As seen, the fact that the economy‚Äôs income may
be described as the sum of the total income of each class - which were ddesignated as two - sustains the
canonical model. The same idea may be applied to individuals. The total income of the economy is the sum
of the income of all individuals in the economy. Analogously, the total income of a class is the sum of the
income of the individuals pertaining to the class. The subsequent mathematical expositions demonstrate these
definitions:

        In this class-personal perspective, the sum of the total income (ùê∏ùëùùëñ ) of capitalist individuals (which in
an ordered manner goes from the first individual to the ùëõùõæ, where ùëõ stands for the total amount of individuals
and ùõæ for the exogenous parameter defined between 0 and 1 establishing the quantity of individuals in each
class) denotes the profits, while wages are the sum of the total income (ùê∏ùë§ùëñ ) of workers individuals (which
following the order, are the individuals indexed from the (ùëõùõæ)th individual to the (ùëõ)th individual). The
definitions may be normalized dividing by the total income of the economy to reveal how the shares of profits
and wages are defined in the class-individual view:

Consequently, the shares of income from the class-personal point of view are delineated as the following
tautology:

                                                    ùëõùõæ               ùëõ

                                                   ùëñ=1            ùëñ=ùëõùõæ


The sum of the individual shares of income of all individuals must account for the total income of the economy.
Once class incomes have been defined as the sum of individual incomes, the personal distribution may be
disclosed. The first step towards unmasking personal distribution in this kaleckian framework is understanding
the fact that each individual may receive a different share of the income. Thus, mathematically, a specific
functional form may describe the personal shares. In other words, each individual may receive different
amounts of income according to specified parameters.
        In the canonical model, given the absence of such parameters, the personal distribution is negligible.
It does not matter whether most of the total earnings of each class pertains to a few individuals. The only
relevant distribution is the functional distribution. As a result, the model implicitly assumes that all individuals
have the same personal share of the output, such that ùê∂ùëùùëñ = ùê∂ùë§ùëñ = ùõΩ ‚àÄ ùëñ. If a continuous function is assumed,
the shares of income may be described as follows:

                               ùëõùõæ        ùëõ          ùëõ             ùëõ
                              ‚àë ùõΩ + ‚àë ùõΩ = ‚àë ùõΩ = ‚à´ ùõΩùëëùëõ = ùõΩ(ùëõ ‚àí 1) = 1
                              ùëñ=1      ùëñ=ùëõùõæ         ùëñ=1          1


                                                              1
                                                        ùõΩ=
                                                             ùëõ‚àí1

        The result is obvious: income is divided equally among all individuals and, thus, the share of income
of each individual corresponds exactly to the ratio given by the division of one individual by the total quantity
of individuals. Following the same tactic applied above and considering the presented personal shares, the
class shares may also be disclosed. Therefore, solving for ùúãùëê gives:

                                              ùëõùõæ
                                                             ùëõùõæ
                                                                         ùëõùõæ ‚àí 1
                                        ùúãùëê = ‚àë ùõΩ = ‚à´ ùõΩùëëùëõ =
                                                           1             ùëõ‚àí1
                                              ùëñ=1


       Since a continuous function has been assumed, it is necessary to observe the behavior of the function
when the number of individuals tends to increase. Applying the limit when n tends to infinity to the function
describing the capitalist share of income demonstrates that:

                                                        lim ùúãùëê = ùõæ
                                                     ùëõ‚Üí‚àû


        The class-individual model, hence, endogenizes class shares as a function of the parameter ùõæ. What
this means is that the parameter which divides who is a capitalist and who is a worker determines the functional
shares. An exogenous ùúã has been substituted by an exogenous ùõæ. Although both converge in the model and
are mathematically indistinguishable, they offer different interpretations. ùúã in the canonical model without
personal distribution directly determined the capitalist share of income. ùõæ determines the number of
                                                             6
individuals in the capitalist class. It is the equal personal distribution that allows both parameters to be
interchangeable. Therefore, the solution of the canonical model does not change with the inclusion of
homogeneous personal distribution. The only variation occurs in the interpretation of the model. When ùõæ and
homogeneous distribution are assumed, the variations on the class shares are due to variations in the quantity
of individuals in the classes.
        It is interesting to notice that the canonical model, even with the inclusion of personal distribution,
assumes that each individual may pertain to a single class. Individuals cannot be capitalists and workers at the
same time. This assumption assigns each individual a unique propensity to save according to the class that he
pertains. Thus, when some authors use interchangeably the terms ‚Äúpropensity to save out of profits‚Äù and
‚Äúpropensity to save of the capitalist class‚Äù, they may induce the erroneous understanding that individuals may
receive both wages and profits in the model. However, the canonical model has a class perspective which
entails class-conflicts. Graphically, the model with personal distribution and class conflict may be represented
as follows:

                       Fig 1. - Homogeneous Personal Distribution with Class-Conflict




                                         Source: prepared by the author

        The horizontal axis represents the individuals indexed in an orderly manner, from the wealthiest to the
poorest individual - even though in this case all individuals earn the same. The graph is defined starting on
one, given that, although a continuous function is assumed, it is senseless to assume less than one individual.
The first graph delineates the personal distribution of income, with the vertical axis representing the earnings
of each individual divided by the total income of the economy. The horizontal line ùõΩ outlines that each
individual receives the same share of income. The profit share and the wage share are the areas of the graph
determined by ùõæ and ùõΩ. The second graph depicts the propensities to save of each individual. Their classes,
for which the delimiting parameter is ùõæ, determine the propensities. As discussed, the propensity to save of
the capitalist class is higher than the propensity to save of workers. Class conflict is preserved since individuals
clearly pertain to single classes without overlaps.
        Graphically, it becomes clearer the direct relationship between ùõæ and ùúã. Increasing the number of
capitalists without changes in the total quantity of individuals increases the share of profits. Moreover, the
graph evinces the role of a homogeneous distribution in the model. If the personal distribution in the first
graph was not a simple division by the total quantity of individuals - what would depict a curve instead of a
horizontal line - the parameters of the curve would determine the shares of profits and wages. Thus, the path
                                                         7
to inserting personal inequality is straightforward: defining the distributive curve of the economy. However,
before that, a distinct interpretation of the parameter ùõæ will be presented.

Earnings-composition perspective

        While class-conflict supports the usual presentation of the canonical model, the model may also
maintain its results when observed from a different perspective. Instead of assuming two different classes in
a way that individuals cannot pertain to both due to the class-conflict, it is also tautological to state that the
sum of all the different types of earnings the individuals receive represents the total income of the economy.
Thus, if all individuals receive profits and wages, the total income of the economy is the sum of the individual
profit shares and the individual wage shares. Class conflict does not exist in this scenario once all individuals
earn both types of income. Mathematically, this point of view is formalized as follows:

                                                            ùëõ

                                                  ùëÉ = ‚àë ùõæùëñ ùê∏ùëñ
                                                           ùëñ=1

                                                      ùëõ

                                              ùëä = ‚àë(1 ‚àí ùõæùëñ )ùê∏ùëñ
                                                      ùëñ=1


The individual share of profits ùõæùëñ of the total individual earnings ùê∏ùëñ measure the individual profits. As a result,
the total profits of the economy are the sum of the individual profits. Wages are analogously represented.
Given that only two types of earnings are assumed, the individual wage share is formalized as (1 ‚àí ùõæùëñ ). The
difference with the previous exposition is that now ùõæùëñ is a parameter that divides the earnings of an individual
in two parts, whereas in the class conflict the parameter was responsible for dividing individuals in two
different conflicting classes. The normalization of the total profits and total wages of the economy in order to
delineate the profit share and wage share of the economy on this ‚Äúincome composition‚Äù perspective results in:

                                                       ùëõ             ùëõ
                                         ùëÉ          ùõæùëñ ùê∏ùëñ

                                                      ùëñ=1            ùëñ=1

                                                       ùëõ                   ùëõ
                                  ùëä                 (1 ‚àí ùõæùëñ )ùê∏ùëñ
                                    = (1 ‚àí ùúãùëí ) = ‚àë             = ‚àë ùëçùë§ùëñ
                                  ùëå                     ùëå
                                                      ùëñ=1                  ùëñ=1


        Once again, as in the class conflict point of view, the personal distribution is not defined, which means
that ùúã is an exogenous parameter that does not depend on the personal distribution. Thus, ùëçùëùùëñ and ùëçùë§ùëñ do
not have assigned functional forms. As follows, the parameter ùõΩ representing the equal division of income
among all individuals of the economy describes the personal distribution, which is assumed to be homogenous.
Moreover, the canonical model has no explicit assumption about the individual composition of income. This
means that, since all individuals earn the same amount of income, it may also be assumed that all individuals
receive their earnings in exact same amounts of profits and wages and ùõæ = ùõæùëñ ‚àÄ ùëñ. Therefore, the aggregate
profit share of the economy may be established mathematically as:

                                                 ùëõ               ùëõ
                                          ùúãùëí = ‚àë ùõæùõΩ = ‚à´ ùõΩùõæùëëùëõ = ùõæ
                                                ùëñ=1              1




                                                            8
        Therefore, either in the earnings point of view or the class perspective, an exogenous parameter ùõæ will
define (and be the same as) the share of profits. The economic interpretation, however, differs according to
the adopted perspective. In the class perspective, the share ùõæ of individuals earning profits - usually called
capitalists - delineates the share of profits. Thus, instead of interpreting the model with a direct exogenous
value for the share of profits in the outcome, the model is reinterpreted with an exogenous parameter defining
the share of individuals which are capitalist in the total quantity of individuals in the economy. Given the
equal distribution, the share of capitalist individuals is the same as the share of profits. On the other hand,
according to the ‚Äúearnings composition‚Äù sight, the parameter defines how much is the share of profits of each
individual in their total earnings. According to this view, the parameter outlines the individual shares of profits,
which on its turn is the same as the economy‚Äôs share of profits, once the distribution is equal among
individuals. The following graph helps in the understanding of how the above perspective differs from the
class conflict perspective:

                   Fig. 2 - Homogeneous Personal Distribution with Earnings Composition




                                         Source: prepared by the author

         The differences between the class-conflict and the earnings-composition are straightforward. First, the
ùõæ becomes a horizontal line instead of a vertical line. This means that all individuals pertain to the same class,
renouncing the class-conflict usual interpretation. Furthermore, all individuals receive the two types of
income, profits and wages, in equal shares. As a result, all individuals must have their own propensities to
save out of wages and profits. Thus, the differences in the propensities to save are not a result of a difference
in classes, but a result of the sources of income. In the image, the absence of a discontinuity in the lines
defining the propensities to save for each kind of income depict the class distinction. The mean propensity to
save of the economy is calculated as before: the profit and wage shares of the economy serve as weights for a
weighted mean.
        Thus, after observing these two different interpretations of the canonical model with a homogeneous
distribution of income among individuals, it is possible to advance to the next step: transforming homogeneity
in heterogeneity. The next sections will include heterogeneity as personal inequality in the model. This
inclusion will, as already have happened above, endogenize the profit share, transforming it on a function of
parameters defining the personal distribution (absent in the above canonical formulations, given the
homogeneous distribution assumption) and the division of class or types of earnings (ùõæ).

Personal inequality

        Finally, the present exposition reaches the point where it may be asked: how is it possible to include
personal inequality in the model? How can it be included individual heterogeneity in the model? A quick look
at the graphs may produce the automatic understanding that heterogeneity could be included both through
distinct personal propensities to save and through distinct personal shares of income (or even both ways). In
other words, a horizontal line in the personal distribution graph could be maintained, while curves in the
propensity to save graph could be included or the other way around. This is a biased cue. Personal distribution
is the only route through which individual heterogeneity in kaleckian models can be included. This results
from a simple mathematical fact as is going to be observed.
        The sum of the earnings of each capitalist times his individual propensity to save describes the total
savings of the capitalist class in the following mode:

                                                           ùëõùõæ

                                                 ùëÜùëù = ‚àë ùê∏ùëùùëñ ùë†ùëñ
                                                           ùëñ=1


The division of the total savings of the capitalist class by the total income of the economy represents the mean
propensity to save of the class:

                                                    ùëõùõæ                   ùëõùõæ
                                            ùëÜùëù    ùê∏ùëùùëñ
                                       ùë†ùëù =    =‚àë     ùë† = ‚àë ùê∂ùëùùëñ ùë†ùëñ
                                            ùëå      ùëå ùëñ
                                                    ùëñ=1                ùëñ=1


Thus, a weighted sum, in which the shares of income of each capitalist represent the weights, formalize the
mean propensity to save of the capitalist class. The weighted sum could be normalized with a division by the
weights to define the weighted mean of capitalists‚Äô propensity to save in the following manner:

                                             ‚àëùëõùõæ
                                              ùëñ=1 ùê∂ùëùùëñ ùë†ùëñ         ‚àëùëõùõæ
                                                                  ùëñ=1 ùê∂ùëùùëñ ùë†ùëñ       ùë†ùëù
                                      ùë†ùëù =                 =                   =
                                              ‚àëùëõùõæ
                                               ùëñ=1 ùê∂ùëùùëñ
                                                                     ùúã             ùúã

The weighted mean, thus, is the mean propensity to save of the capitalist class divided by the share of income
of this class. Consequently, the weighted mean times the share of profits is equal to the mean propensity to
save of the capitalist class.

                                                    ùë†ùëù ùúã = ùë†ùëù

Therefore, the individual propensities to save converge to the weighted mean times the income share of a
class. This result can be easily demonstrated for different perspectives (maintaining or not class conflict, for
instance), for different classes and the whole economy. According to this result, assuming heterogeneity in
the savings function is innocuous. Mathematically, the simple determination of a single value that represents
the weighted mean (or the simple mean) of the propensity to save of the targeted class achieves the same result
as defining individual propensities to save. This result may be called class-propensity correspondence, given
that propensities only correspond to classes. Personal propensities do not exist in the post-Keynesian
framework. Thus, individuals save as class. To clear up, in post-Keynesian growth models of the kind
presented above, there is no reason for determining functional forms for personal savings, unless one is
inclined to assume the propensities to save as the weights of the shares of income - an assumption that would
make no obvious sense.

        Thus, answering the initial question of the section, heterogeneity has to be included only through a
heterogeneous personal distribution of income. Hence, The addition of a functional form in the place of the ùõΩ
that represented the homogeneous personal distribution in the previous interpretations of the canonical model
formalizes heterogeneity.
        However, before mathematically formalizing the extended model with personal inequality, it is
interesting to outline some intuitive possibilities of extending the model - given the two interpretations
presented and the constraint above explained. As seen, three new aspects can be inserted in the model: the
parameter ùõæ in a class-conflict; the parameter ùõæ in an earnings-composition interpretation; and a functional
form defining personal distribution. The model, thus, can be extended with the inclusion of numerous classes
and types of earnings either through the inclusion of a functional form to the parameter ùõæ or additional
parameters (as horizontal or vertical lines in the graph). Thus, the model may combine both class-conflict and
earnings composition points of view defining some areas of the graph as profits and others as wages.
        It is interesting to notice that the functional form of the personal distribution must not be continuous
and may present numerous local maximums. Economically, this would make sense as intra-class distributions.
For instance, the individuals in the working class could have their income distributed differently than the
capitalists. Although mathematically possible, the inclusion of different intra-earnings distributions would be
of difficult interpretation.
        Depending on the number of classes, the number of different types of earnings, and the number of
different intra-class distributions, the model can become quickly complex. The following image demonstrates
a conceptual case with three classes, two types of earnings and intra-class inequality:

        The example could be even more peculiar, given that there is not the necessity of using lines and well-
behaved curves, but the illustration nonetheless achieves the point of demonstrating where this type of
interpretation may go. Still, and more importantly, some insights may be acquired without complex

formulations. As follows, it seems necessary to present simpler cases in order to set the standards for the
inclusion of more complex cases of personal distribution and disclose the main intuitions behind this
perspective of modeling post-Keynesian models.
         Therefore, from here on, the paper will be interested in formally presenting two cases of the model
with personal distribution not yet present in the literature: class-conflict with overall inequality and earnings-
composition with overall inequality. Consequently, the only addition to the two canonical perspectives above
outlined will be the inclusion of a functional form defining the overall distribution of income in the economy.
It is interesting to notice that any functional form may be assumed. The only necessary condition is that the
sum of personal shares equals one. Still, for reasons to be discussed soon, in this paper the Pareto function of
distribution, which the following density probability function (PDF) establishes, will be the chosen functional
form:

                                                          ùõΩùë•ùëö ùë•ùëö =1 ùõΩ
                                                                ‚áí
                                                          ùë• ùõΩ+1    ùë• ùõΩ+1

        The usual interpretation of the Pareto function, however, is through its cumulative density function,
with which it is possible to observe the concentration of income by percentages of the population. In fact, it is
quite unusual to interpret income distribution in such a disaggregated degree. Commonly, income shares are
a preferable mode of observation, which allows interesting interpretations. Here, this interpretation, while
useful, will not be utilized for technical reasons. As described in the above formalizations, the income is being
represented as the sum of individual incomes and not as the sum of shares of the population. This demands a
characterization of a functional form for such a sum. In this context, the Pareto density probability function,
breaking away from more common presentations, will be utilized as a ruse for describing an ordered sum of
personal incomes in the following manner:

According to the equations, each individual receives a share ùëõùõΩ+1 of income, where n represents the index of
the individual in the scale of wealth. A peculiarity occurs when describing the sum of individual incomes with
the functional form of a pareto probability density function. In a continuous function where ùõΩ is higher than
zero, the PDF where ùë•ùëö equals one is a convergent series with a convergence value of one. Still, there is no
economy with an infinite number of individuals. As follows, when observing the function discretely, it seems
paradoxical to assume a ùõΩ higher than one, since the first individual would have a share of income higher than
the total income of the economy. Consequently, for a sounder economic interpretation, it seems preferable to
assume that ùõΩ stands between zero and one. This way, ùõΩ represents the share of income of the richest individual
in the economy, which cannot surpass the total income of the economy. Still, given that a continuous function
will be assumed henceforward7, there is no impediment for assuming higher values of ùõΩ.
        Besides this idiosyncrasy of the proposed formulation, the Pareto distribution, as pointed by
Yakovenko (2012), is a fair approximation of the personal distribution of the income of economies. Moreover,
it has a simple interpretation of inequality. The higher the ùõΩ parameter, the more unequal the economy
becomes. Consequently, although any functional form could be assumed, the fair approximation and simple
interpretation present the pareto function as an interesting option for further formalizations. This task will be

faced on the two sections in the sequence. The first will formalize overall personal distribution with the pareto
sum of individual incomes in a context of class conflicts. Next, the context of class conflict will be substituted
for observing the pareto function in a perspective of earnings-composition.

Class-Conflict with overall inequality

        The model has only one change when compared to the canonical model with class conflict in an
interpretation with individuality. Instead of a horizontal line determined by the equal share of income for all
individuals in the economy, the Pareto distribution depicts the model‚Äôs distribution of income. The following
image intends to facilitate the interpretation of the following formalization of the model:

        As it can be observed, the profit and wage shares are now dependent not only on the ùõæ parameter that
defines the individual class conflict, but also on the parameter defining the personal distribution of income,
the parameter ùõΩ. Given the property of integration that allows to separate any integral in the sum of its parts,
the totality of the individual shares may be described as the sum of the wage and profit share as follows:

         As a result, now the functional shares of the economy are functions of two exogenous parameters.
First, the already discussed parameter that sets the class conflict, ùõæ. Second, the parameter that defines the
degree of inequality in the economy, ùõΩ. Differentiating the equation results in the marginal response of the
functional shares for increases in these parameters:

The first derivative demonstrates that increases in the degree of inequality increase the profit share of the
economy, whereas the second demonstrates that increasing the number of individuals in the capitalist class
increases the profit share. These two results were expected. There is no paradox. The inclusion of these two
results in the equilibrium presented by ùë¢‚àó in the canonical model reaffirms common expectations:

                                                             ùëé

Thus, higher inequality in the class-conflict with overall personal distribution (assuming a Pareto distribution)
entails inferior degrees of utilization in the economy. Furthermore, the higher the number of capitalists, the
less the degree of utilization of equilibrium. Do these results maintain in an earnings composition perspective?
The following section formalizes this different point of view to answer this question.

Earnings-Composition with overall inequality

        While the previous formalization has not changed much from the canonical version beyond the
endogenization of the profit share as a function of personal inequality and individual class conflict, the
earnings composition has a slightly different parameter interpretation in the presence of personal inequality.
The ùõæ in the canonical version with a composition perspective was interpreted as the share of profits in the
income of all individuals in the economy, set to be equal among all of them. However, with the inclusion of
personal inequality, the parameter will not affect all individuals. Consequently, the parameter now describes
who are the individuals that receive two kinds of income. Knowing that ùõΩ, beyond being the parameter that
defines the degree of inequality in the economy, is also the highest share of income of an individual in the
economy, allows to interpret ùõæ as a parameter of comparison. More clearly, all individuals who earn a
percentage ùõæ or less of the wealthiest individual, do not earn profits. As follows, when an individual reaches
the share ùõΩùõæ of income, he starts to diversify its earnings, receiving a share as profits. Before that, the
individual only receives wages. Consequently, ùõæ will be called diversification parameter. The following image
clarifies this interpretation:

        As it can be observed, not all individuals compound their income with profits and wages. The point ùúë
in the horizontal axis, determined by the intersection between the distributional curve and ùõΩùõæ, describes the
threshold where individuals earn two types of income or only one. The following equation specifies the point:

                                                         1 1

With the intersection point in the horizontal axis, it becomes simple to disclose the areas of the graph
representing the profit and wage shares. The profit share is calculated as follows:

                                                     ùúë                  ùúë

                                   ùúãùëí (ùõΩ, ùõæ) = ‚àíùõæ ùõΩ+1 (ùõΩ + 1) + ùõΩùõæ + 1

This result implies that the wage share may be represented in the following manner:

       Once again, the profit and wage shares were endogenized as functions of the equality parameter, ùõΩ,
and the parameter ùõæ, now called diversification parameter. Thus, the exogenous forces controlling the degree
of inequality in the economy and the degree of diversification of income command the behavior of the
functional shares. To see how modifications in these forces alter the profit and wage shares it is possible to
observe the results of the following derivatives:

                                     ùëëùúãùëí       ùõΩ    ln ùõæ
                                         = ‚àíùõæ ùõΩ+1 (      + 1) + ùõæ <> 0

                                               = ùõΩ [1 ‚àí ( ) ] < 0

Interestingly, different from the class-conflict perspective, modifications in the equality parameter do not have
clear signals. It is interesting to notice that in economies where the pattern of diversification starts in lower
                                                                                      ùëëùúãùëí
levels of income (ùõæ less than 0.3 for instance, given that for ln ùõæ < ‚àí(ùõΩ + 1),             is always positive), the
                                                                                      ùëëùõΩ
profit-share may respond in a positive manner to increases in inequality. In these economies, more inequality
results in a higher profit-share. However, for economies where the diversification occurs only at the top level
of income shares, an increase in inequality decreases the profit share. This occurs because the increase in
inequality reduces the number of individuals willing to (or capable of) diversify their income. An increase in
the share of income of those individuals who keep diversifying does not totally compensate such reduction.
Therefore, while inequality always increased the profit share in the class conflict model, this is not true from
an earnings composition point of view.
        Still, the effects of the diversification parameter are analogous to the effects of the class conflict
parameter ùõæ. Their signals, however, are opposed, because an increase in the number of individuals earning
profits is now associated with a decrease in the threshold defining the individuals willing to diversify. Thus,
even though the signals are opposed, in both models the exogenous increase in the quantity of individuals
earning profits provides increases in the profit share of the economy. It is interesting to add the results to the
equilibrium to see the effect in the equilibrium utilization rate of the economy. This is represented by the
equations:

                                                              ùëé

                                                      ùëëùë¢‚àó

         As it can be analyzed, the higher the threshold of diversification the less the degree of utilization. This
means that more individuals are opting solely for wages which is profitable for increases in the degree of
utilization. As in any canonical version of Kaleckian models, high profit shares are associated with low
outputs. Furthermore, inequality may paradoxically increase the degree of utilization depending on the value
of the diversification parameter. In economies where to diversify an individual has to earn a share too close
of the wealthiest individual, inequality decreases the profit share and increases the degree of utilization of the
economy. As a result, inequality may be beneficial for the output of economies.

Concluding Remarks

         While it is common in the post-Keynesian literature to organize demand-led models starting on the
tautological fact that the total income of an economy is the sum of the income its classes, it is unusual to
extend this tautology to affirm that the total income may also be represented as the sum of individual incomes.
In fact, both tautologies are the same when it is assumed that a single individual forms each class. The lack
of such extension suppresses the role of individuality in post-Keynesian growth models. As a result, personal
distribution as an impersonation of individuality is commonly overlooked. Functional distribution suffices as
a category of analysis.
         Notwithstanding, the growing concern with personal inequality and its known impacts on the growth
patterns of economies demands the attention of the post-Keynesian literature. Still, models have only recently
started to cope with personal inequality in a demand-led context. Beyond multiple class models and intra-class
formulations, few have been the didactic expositions of the problem. The complexity, unfortunately, may be
hampering the progression of important discussions. Moreover, it conceals important implications for the
usual interpretations and results of canonical models.
         The present paper intended to fulfill this gap of the literature, presenting a didactic note on personal
inequality in post-Keynesian growth models. The strategy was simple and direct: individuality was inserted
through the tautology that affirms that the sum of a class income may be represented by the sum of the income
of its individuals. Consequently, through the definition of how these shares are distributed the model could be
closured with personal inequality.
         Interestingly, the insertion of individuality allowed the model to be interpreted from two different
perspectives: class-conflict and earnings-composition. The first did not flee from canonical interpretations and
established class conflict as the increase or decrease in the number of individuals in each class. The second,
however, presented a slight change on normal interpretations of post-Keynesian models. In this perspective,
classes do not distinguish individuals. Furthermore, individual may receive more than one type of income.
While this second aspect is clear for researchers, class-conflicts‚Äô frameworks usually impede this
interpretation. With the earnings-composition presentation of the canonical models, it becomes clear that there
is no problem in interpreting the model with multiple types of income rather than with multiple classes, given
that in the canonical versions ùõæ converges to ùúã in both interpretations.
         To formalize the model with overall inequality, the Pareto distribution was used as a ruse to represent
the sum of individual shares of income. The effect was an endogenization of the profit-share as a function of
the degree of inequality of the economy. Depending on the perspective adopted, the closure with personal
inequality presented different results. On the class conflict side, the profit share increased both with increases
in the inequality and with the increase in the number of individuals in the capitalist class. On the earning-
composition side, the profit share increases when the number of individuals capable of diversifying their
income increases. However, the increase in inequality not necessarily increases the profit-share of the
economy. This occurs because the increase in inequality reduces the number of individuals capable of
diversifying and, also, increases the share of income of the individuals who keep diversifying. Depending on
the size of each one of these effects, the profit-share may increase or decrease.
         As it can be seen, this simple reformulation combined with a different perspective already allowed the
observation of a different result. Consequently, more important than the formal aspects of the paper, the
presentation of a simple form of including personal distribution and a different point of view for interpreting
post-Keynesian growth models opens the way for different formulations and may promote the dissemination
of formal and informal discussions of personal inequality on the literature.
         Finally, it is important to clarify the theoretical nature of the paper. The empirical validity of the
presented models is not under scrutiny. The main intention is to propose a framework of observation, rather

                                                       17
than to ingress in the usual post-Keynesian discussion of closeness how close to reality models should be. It
is of the nature of models to be simplifications. As simplifications, models are false. It is not always a matter
of degree. A model more empirically valid is nonetheless false. The question that matters here is whether
models offer an interesting tool for thought experiments. In this sense, the proposed framework is far from
contending that previous aggregated models were invalid fo neglecting individuality. The point is to expand
the toolbox, rather than to substitute the tools.
