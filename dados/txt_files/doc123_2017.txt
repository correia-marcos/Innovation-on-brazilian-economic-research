Abstract
Within modern evolutionary economics, the nexus of innovation and trade relationship is commonly regarded from a tech-
nological gap and gains of market-share for innovating countries. According to this strand, strongly related to the pioneer
theorists of technological gap theory of trade, the technology-gap is the difference or technological distance between tech-
niques employed by countries and those used by leading or innovative countries. However, measuring the technology-gap has
been difficult, and proxies currently used – e.g. patents or R&D investments – are limited in many ways. This paper suggest
that Economic Complexity Index (ECI) is an appropriate proxy for the countries’ innovation performance and advances by
creating a measure of technology-gap based in this index. Further, by means of a gravity equation I empirically estimated
the technology-gap elasticity based on a panel of 90 countries covering the years from 1995-2012. Results indicate that
the technological gap demonstrate important impacts on bilateral trade. The debate on technology and trade is central for
economic development issues, especially for developing and underdeveloped countries.

1.       Introduction
The idea of technical change positively impacting exports via improvements on
production efficiency in innovating countries is broadly accepted, especially among
theorists of the technological gap (Posner, 1961; Soete, 1981; Fagerberg, 1987;
Maggi, 1993; Dosi et al., 2015; Verspagen, 1993) 1 . For these authors, technology
gaps represents the level of advancement or efficiency of technologies adopted by
countries – or firms within producing countries – compared to cutting-edge tech-
nologies available worldwide. Innovation can also simultaneously increase firm
productivity and create a new product or a close substitute. This approach has
emphasized technology differences between countries as the major driver of trade
flows and patterns of specialization. Many times these differences are rationalized
by ”product-cycle” hypothesis, as in the North-South models of trade – see Krug-
man (1979). Accordingly, technology evolution has distinct phases, from innova-
tion to imitation, and capabilities of innovation is asymmetrically distributed across
countries, as pointed out by Vernon (1966) and many others. Dosi et al. (2015),
and Hufbauer (1970) formerly, advocate that trade flows are primarily driven from
sector-specific absolute advantages, a result from strong asymmetries in countries
capabilities to innovate and/or imitate. Importantly, advantages related to non-
technological factors, such as land costs, human capital, among others, can poten-
tially offset the benefits of technological leadership. Technology’s diffusion pace
and pattern are key to change impacts. In some cases elapsed time between an inno-
vation and its critical adoption point can be delayed by the slow market acceptance
of a new technology (Dosi et al., 1990, 2015; Dosi and Soete, 1988; Posner, 1961;
Maggi, 1993).
     Of course, technology differences across countries were considered a major
source of Comparative Advantage (CA) also in the Ricardian model of trade. But,
even in most modern version of Ricardian model, technology is usually regarded as
unchangeable and fundamental for explaining specialization and trade gains. Be-
sides, one can consider a related list of limitations including fully employment of all
resources in every country, absence of dynamic increasing returns, perfect capital
and labor mobility across sectors, among others. In other words, perfect competi-
tion, absence of trade barriers, homothetic preferences and, in some cases, geog-
raphy, will necessarily create an world with certain degrees of specialization and
trade of goods and services. Firms can differ in terms of technology, but perfect
competition eliminates variety – see Dornbusch et al. (1977); Eaton and Kortum
(2002) for a most recent formalization of Ricardian model.
     Although the ”neotechnology hypothesis” has been accepted and empirically
tested for several studies, economists have struggled with the lack of adequate prox-
ies for the technology-gap, covering considerable set of countries. Currently, most
     1
    The technology-gap theories is also known as the ”neotechnology” hypothesis. This jargon was
especially used by authors’ during the 1980s.
                                 Economic Complexity and Trade

studies rely on patent or R&D data, which is notably restrictive in terms of longitu-
dinal extended availability, besides other flaws commonly related in terms of these
proxies adequacy.
    More recently, Hausmann et al. (2011) have proposed a innovative measure for
economic complexity 2 . By economic complexity, the authors mean the amount
of knowledge that a country has, expressed in the diversity and ubiquity of the
products it makes (Hausmann et al., 2011). Noteworthy, author’s description of
knowledge, and how it is expressed in assymmetric innovative capacity around the
globe, are notably analagous to ideas presented in many studies within evolutionary
economics strand - see Dosi and Nelson (2010) for example. Moreover, the idea of
differences in economic complexity as a source of notable asymmetries in the levels
of economic development is consistent with both structuralist and evolutionary
economics views of economic development challenges (Raúl, 1959; Prebisch,
1950; Gala et al., 2016; Fagerberg, 1987).

    As ECI is build on the analysis of diversity and ubiquity of products supplied
by a particular economy, it can be interpreted as a technology-output measure,
likewise patents. Knowledge directly affects the capabilities of innovation and
imitation, which is reflected at the complexity of the products a country produces.
The ECI index is calculated from trade data and covers a large range of countries.

     Besides, trade dispersion and attraction of bilateral trade have been treated by
estimation of gravity equations in the field of empirical approaches to international
trade for a long time – see Anderson and Wincoop (2003) for a generally accepted
theory and estimation of gravity equation. However, only a few studies make use
of these models to estimate technology elasticity of trade, based on the building
blocks of technology-gap approach. Soete (1981), by considering variables such as
GDPs and distance in her analysis of technology-gap impacts on trade, therefore,
structured equations quite similar to modern specifications of gravity. As gravity
equations are structured to analyze trade between trade partners, one can estimate
the impact of the technology-gap between a pair of countries on their bilateral trade.
Interesting, the bilateral approach open a room for a slight and equally important
analysis of technology-gap. Pioneers theorists of the gap focused on a strictly mul-
tilateral approach, considering that leading countries trade more, no matter the des-
tination of exports. Although this hypothesis is corroborated by several empirical
studies, including this one, investigation of the role of the gap in bilateral trade is
also of interest. I denominate this of bilateral technology-gap.
     Thus, the aim of this paper is to estimate the impact of the bilateral technological
gap on trade. In doing so, a gravity model extended by a bilateral technology-gap
proxy based on ECI is estimated.
     This study mainly contributes to the current literature by corroborating the ex-

istence of effects of technical progress on trade. It advances by considering a new
proxy for the technology-gap, more specifically a bilateral proxy based on ECI. A
greater understanding of how technical progress and trade relates is paramount to
economic development issues. This paper is divided into three remaining sections
besides this introduction. Section 2 introduces the methodology. Section 3 presents
the estimation results. Finally, section 4 concludes the paper.


2.       Methodology
This is an empirical paper and a formal theory of technology-gap generating gravity
is not fully delivered 3 . Major methodological challenge, at this point, is to structure
a gravity equation extended by an adequate proxy for technology-gaps.
In doing so, I explicitly departed from most generally accepted specifications of
gravity for panel data analysis – see Egger and Pfaffermayr (2003); Baltagi et al.
(2014). Some of major concerns about misspecification of gravity equations amount
to sample selection bias and estimation of linear models in the presence of het-
eroskedasticity. Also important, multilateral resistance to trade (MRT) and other
non-observed countries’ characteristics, and analysis of longitudinal data requires
appropriate procedures to obtaining unbiased estimates. Taking this issues into
account, country and year fixed effects were employed and a Poisson pseudo-
maximum-likelihhod model was estimated in adittion to the usual Ordinary Least
Square, as suggested by Silva and Tenreyro (2006) 4 . A model comprising such
characteristics, i.e country and year fixed effects, are usually labeled as a three way
model. The final equation to be estimated can be written as follows, in its linear
form:

             mijt = β0 + ϕyit + αyjt + γij + ωj + λj + δt + σTij + uijt                     (1)
    where, lower case represents the logarithm of corresponding variables, and yit is
the country i’s income, yjt country j’s income, γij is a vector of time-invariant bilat-
eral costs, commonly proxied by geographic distances and a set of dummies identi-
fying colonial ties, common language, contiguity, among others. ωj , λj and deltat
are, respectively, fixed effects for country j, country i and time. Finally, sigmaTij
is the technology gap between country i and country j. Note that sigmaTij is not
linearized in the final equation. Estimates were also performed with the natural
logarithm of sigmaTij , returning similar results in terms of statistic significance
and signals. However, R2 for both models revealed that the variable is preferred
in its non linearized form. Fixed effect interaction between countries and time are
     3
     Theory has been developed and will be published in the future.
     4
     Two-stage estimations a la Heckman are broadly employed by trade economists, especially in
the presence of strong evidences of sample selection. Helpman et al. (2008) developed a complete
framework for a two-stage analysis, which treats for sample selection and firm heterogeneity.
                             Economic Complexity and Trade

not included, although recommended by part of the literature, but incomes of coun-
try i and j have been considered a satisfacotry control for such effects Egger and
Pfaffermayr (2003). Also, interactions between countries and year would turn the
estimation of bilateral-gap elasticity inappropriate based on theory considered. If
changes in countries relative position regarding technology is considered, at best,
rare, the bilateral-gap is almost time invariant. All tests and models were run in
the Comprehensive R Archive Network (R Cran) making use of several packages,
including gravity, plm, glm, sandwich, lmtest, car and tseries packages.


2.1.    Data
Data on bilateral trade derives from the BACI database, which was developed by
CEPII at a high level of product disaggregation (for detailed information see Guil-
laume and Zignago (2010)). Data was aggregated to obtain country’s total trade
value by partner and year. General gravity data, such as distance, colonial ties, com-
mon language, contiguous, among others, come from the GeoDist database also by
CEPII (for detailed information see Mayer and Zignago (2011)). Gross Domestic
Product at current prices comes from the IMF database. Finally, ECI were obtained
directly from the data set made available by The Atlas of Economic Complexity
team.
    Final database comprises 145,440 observations for 18 years, 36 variables, and
90 different countries. From this sample, 130,662 observations returned positive
trade flows. In Box 2, in Appendix A, we briefly describe all (7) variables that
actually entered the final estimations.


2.2.    Bilateral technology-gap proxy
This paper sample considered, ECI index varies from −2.20800 to 3.25200. Look-
ing to create a measure of bilateral technology-gap, one could simply create any
relation between partners to capture their differences in terms of innovative perfor-
mance. Let Tit be the technology status in country i in year t and Tjt the same for
country j. Thus, Tit /Tjt is the ratio of country i’ technology in relation to technol-
ogy in country j. If ECI was strictly positive, one could assume ECI = Tij , thus
Tij > 1 would signify country i has superior innovative capacity when compared to
country j, and, analogously, Tij < 1 would return the opposite statement. However,
ECI is not strictly positive. Thus, it was needed to re-scale ECI to comprise strictly
positive values ranging from 1 to 6.460. It was carried out by simply summing up a
constant of value 3.20800 to all values within the time series 5 .
   5
     Another way to calculate technology gap is to simply subtract original ECI of country i from
ECI index of country j. Estimations were also employed to this alternative measure, but model
significance is better when the ratio of re-scaled ECI is considered. Nonetheless, both measures of
bilateral technology-gap returned positive and significant values for all models.
3.    Results and Discussion
Results are presented in Table1. As above mentioned, although being the most
common econometric procedure, estimation via OLS may return biased coefficients
in presence of heteroskedasticity, and it requires the drop out of non-positive trade
volumes. Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML), however, is robust in pres-
ence of heteroskesdasticity and can be estimated over the entire sample regardless
positive and non-positive trade links. As there is no consensus about the best pro-
cedure to gravity estimation, results from both models are presented to reinforce
robustness. Remarkably, results are consistent within and between both models.

     Time-invariant bilateral effects γij - distance, colonial ties, common language
and contiguity - returned expected coefficeint values in terms of signal and magni-
tude based on literature and trade theory. Distance are expected to increase bilateral
trade costs, as stated by the hypothesis of iceberg costs (Samuelson, 1952). Cul-
tural ties measured by colony and language are expected to increase bilateral trade,
as well as the existence of a land border. Noteworthy, as reported in the seminal
paper by Silva and Tenreyro (2006), colony and common language returns consid-
erable smaller coefficients when PPML estimation is performed.
Let us focus on the estimated technology-gap elasticity obtained from both models.
It is statistically and economically significant in both models, confirming the impact
of bilateral technology-gap on trade. Importantly, estimates for the same sample re-
veals that countries with higher ECI indexes, without any transformation, exports
significantly more no matter the destination – 0.232 with p < 0.0001 in the PPML
model, which consistently returns smaller coefficients values for all estimates. It
corroborates the importance of technology-gaps to trade and suggests that multilat-
eral gap is more important than bilateral gap in determining trade – coefficient value
0.120 in PPML. However, the bilateral gap is also important and brings out different
information on bilateral trade formation. In words, a positive impact of bilateral-
gap on trade means that bilateral trade volume is greater when exporter has greater
innovative capacity in relation to importing country. It reveals the asymmetric na-
ture of trade in presence of technology-gaps and reinforces trade links based on
North-South dynamic. That is, results suggest a natural trend in formation of asym-
metrical commercial relations, between advanced and non-advanced economies,
based on technology capacities. Moreover, the ”North” - or simply most innovative
countries - relies on its innovative capacity to keep their commercial advantages. As
innovative capabilities is asymmetrically around the globe, and they impact trade
significantly, world trade network is not expected to change drastically over time.
This ”stability”of world trade network is corroborated by empirical works Fagiolo
(2009). Papers results combined with other pieces of work reinforces the hypothe-
sis that imitation is becoming costly, given the complexity of modern technologies
which requires articulation of a vast ”pieces” of knowledge. As imitation is the
counter-force closing the gaps, one can expected increases in technology gap in the
future.




4.    Conclusions

In this paper, I evaluated the impacts of technological gap on bilateral trade through
a proxy based on the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). Using such a proxy and
treating the technology-gap from the bilateral perspective are two of the major con-
tributions of this paper. The model considers that bilateral trade is a function of
sizes, trade variable and fixed costs, and technology gap. It is an extension of tra-
ditional gravity equations. Results show that bilateral technology gap significantly
impact bilateral trade, and corroborates the importance of multilateral gap. Our
findings may contribute to improved policy design, showing, above all, the impor-
tance of industrial policies focused on innovation or imitation capacity to close bi-
lateral and multilateral gaps. Finally, given industry specialization, bilateral gap is
expected to impact in greater magnitude bilateral trade, when sector trade is consid-
ered. Future research on sector data can reveal interesting results about bilateral-gap
and trade dynamics.
