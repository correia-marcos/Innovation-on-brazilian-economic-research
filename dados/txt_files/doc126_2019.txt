Abstract
In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, there is a series of changes in the scenario
of financial regulation. Globally, several macroprudential measures that seek to limit systemic risk are
currently in use. We evaluated the effect of these measures on the market power of banks in the Brazilian
case, in which there was a process of great banking concentration that coexists with high bank spreads.
Using an innovative methodology, we show that the effect of macroprudential measures is to reduce bank
competition by increasing the market power of banks. It is essential that financial regulators consider
this adverse effect in the design of a financial regulation that not only aims at financial stability but also
a more competitive banking system.

1. Introduction
    The financial crisis that hit the economies of the world from 2007 to 2009 reinvigorated the de-
bate on how to regulate banks and other financial institutions to ensure financial stability. Before
the global financial crisis (GFC) financial regulation for banks and other financial intermediaries
was focused on instruments aimed at reducing the risk of bankruptcy, i.e., microprudential mea-
sures. However, as seen in the GFC, the bankruptcy of a large financial institution (FI) put at risk
the solvency of the system as a whole and raised concerns about global financial stability. Since
then, systemic risk became the focus of financial regulation - macroprudential measures.
    The implementation of this new set of micro and macroprudential measures has raised several
challenges for assessing the impact of such measures on banks and the financial system as a
whole and spurred a vast literature on the subject. One of the main challenges is to evaluate the
effectiveness of macroprudential policies concerning the central objective of increasing resilience.
Besides that, to smooth the business cycles of the financial system (Claessens et al., 2013; Claessens
& Laeven, 2004; Cerutti et al., 2017; Jiménez et al., 2017; Altunbas et al., 2018; Ely et al., 2019;
Klingelhöger & Sun, 2019; Richter et al., 2019).
    To the best of our knowledge, we note that most of the research focuses on analyzing the
impact of prudential measures (micro and macroprudential) on bank loans, risk-taking behavior
of the FI, or transmission of monetary policies, however, not directly on the (in) efficiency of the
credit market. There are few exceptions. The first is the work of Cubillas & Suárez (2018) that
investigates the negative impact of the GFC on the availability of credit and find that the increase
of the banks’ market power neutralized this effect. The relevant fact of this study is that this
neutralizing effect on the availability of credit, caused by the increase in market power, is more
significant in countries with fewer restrictions on the activities of banks, or less power of official
supervision of financial institutions.
    The second is Ayyagari et al. (2018) combining balance sheet data on 900,000 firms from
48 countries between 2003 and 2011 with detailed data on the use of macroprudential policy
instruments. The main result indicate that macroprudential policies are negatively associated
with firm financing growth.
    In light of this situation, this article, in a pioneering way, investigates the influence of some
prudential measures (micro and macroprudential) on the market power of Brazilian banks using
a new class of market power estimation models based on border techniques (Stochastic Frontier
Analysis - SFA), initially proposed by Kumbhakar et al. (2012).
    The central hypothesis formulated in this paper is that prudential rules to which FIs are subject
may affect banks market power. According to Claessens & Laeven (2004), any policy that restricts
banking activity and makes it challenging to operate has negative impacts on market competition,
since it enables large banks to increase their market power. Therefore, a strict prudential regulatory
framework could affect concentration indices and influence the market power of FIs since the
implementation of Basel I agreements in 1988.
    Our main contribution is to demonstrate that tightening on prudential measures has a posi-
tive impact on bank mark-ups and, therefore, detrimental effects on competition in the Brazilian
banking industry. Although not wholly comparable, intuitively, our results are contrary to those of
Cubillas & Suárez (2018). A second empirical verification was to establish a positive relationship
between concentration and mark-up, in the same sense established by the traditional structure-
conduct-performance paradigm of industrial organization literature.
    Another contribution concerns the empirical method. For the first time, we employ SFA models
to estimate market power for Brazilian banks on an individual basis. With the estimation of the

Lerner indexes for each bank, it is possible to evaluate the market power according to ownership
and to verify that state-owned banks have market power slightly lower than the private banks and
foreign banks, respectively. Finally, we also obtain estimates of returns to scale that provides some
evidence that Brazil’s financial institutions operate with decreasing returns to scale.
    We organize the remainder of the paper as follows. In section two, we present related literature.
We present the empirical model in section three, while we describe the database and the empirical
strategy in section four. In the fifth section, we present our main results, and in the sixth and last
section, we present our final considerations.

2. Brief Literature Review
    We can divide the literature related to our article into two groups. The first group focuses on
the effectiveness of prudential measures, while the second focuses on the traditional literature of
industrial organization, more specifically, on the estimation of market power.
    Before GFC the focus of financial regulation for banks and other financial intermediaries was on
instruments aimed at reducing the risk of bankruptcy, i.e., measures of a microprudential nature
and not on the financial system as a whole. However, as seen in the GFC, the bankruptcy of a large
FI put at risk the solvency of the system as a whole. When a large FI fails, there is potential for
amplification and contagion in the banking system. These effects may lead to cascade failures in
the financial system, which can provoke a significant shock that affects the real sector adversely. In
order to account for the interconnections that may exist between financial system players, financial
regulation changed its focus to curb systemic risk, using macroprudential measures.
    The works of Moreno (2011), Galati & Moessner (2013), Lim et al. (2011), Claessens et al.
(2013), Claessens (2015) and Freixas et al. (2015) summarize the main prudential instruments
(microprudential and macroprudential) implemented by developed and developing countries. Also,
they present their meaning and purpose to mitigate the probability of bankruptcy of FIs and the
systemic risk arising from the procyclicality and the interconnectivity between FIs.
    Among the empirical studies, Lim et al. (2011) analyze the links between macroprudential
policies and the development of the credit market and bank leverage. They find evidence suggesting
that the presence of policies such as limits on maximum loan value (LTV), limits of indebtedness
(DTI), limits of credit growth, capital reserve requirements and dynamic rules of provisioning are
associated with reductions in the procyclicality of credit and leverage.
    Claessens et al. (2013) investigate how the change in the individual balance sheets of banks in
48 countries in the period 2000-2010 responds to specific changes in some macro-legal measures.
Among the main results, the authors show that the maximum limits of LTV, DTI, and the maxi-
mum limits of foreign currency lending are effective in reducing the growth of bank leverage and
the price of assets.
    Aiyar et al. (2014) show that, in response to stricter capital requirements (capital requirement),
regulated banks reduce borrowing while unregulated banks may even increase. Gropp et al. (2018)
study the requirement for higher capital requirements. Its results point to a reduction in credit
and a smaller search for capital to meet the new targets. Auer & Ongena (2019) find that an
additional capital requirement on real estate loans leads to growth in the retail lending channel.
    In addition to this empirical evidence, Cerutti et al. (2017) using an IMF survey covering the
use of twelve macroprudential measures in 119 countries over the period 2000-2013 indicate that,
in general, emerging countries use intensely such instruments. Also, instruments such as LTV
and others that limit the level of indebtedness are associated with the decline in credit growth,
especially real estate lending.

                                                  3
    Other studies, however, focusing on a few prudential measures and for few countries, also stand
out. Igan & Kang (2011) investigate only the effectiveness of LTV and DTI measures in Korea.
Wong et al. (2011) also use only the LTV and DTI measures to investigate the behavior of real
estate credit and real estate prices in Hong Kong. Camors & Peydro (2014) investigate the effect
of capital withdrawal in Uruguay in the year 2008. Aiyar et al. (2014) also investigate the capital
requirement for UK banks and confirm a substantial effect on the bank loan. Finally, more recently,
Altunbas et al. (2018) direct the investigation of the effectiveness of macroprudential measures for
the risk behavior of banks.
    Overall, this literature shows that for different countries, samples, and prudential measures,
there is a positive effect on systemic risk. Countries that implement these measures can reduce
their lending growth to more sustainable levels and improve their financial stability. However,
what is the costs of these measures? Is there a trade-off in using such measures? We now discuss
the market power and bank competition literature to assess the second strand of the literature
that helps us make our connection.
    In the competition-related literature in the banking industry, research models and approaches
generally have a limitation due to the structure and availability of data. However, the model of
Panzar & Rosse (1987) - PR - is a standard method when one wants to evaluate the degree of
competition in the industry. Only in Brazil, we can cite the works of Belaisch (2003), Araújo &
Jorge Neto (2007), Lucinda (2010), Tabak et al. (2012), Silva, Barbosa et al. (2015), Tabak &
Gomes (2015) and Cardoso et al. (2016). In our investigation, we found only two other studies
that did not use the PR model. Nakane (2002) uses a structural model as proposed by Bresnahan
& Reiss (1991) and Coelho et al. (2013) use a bank entry model developed by Bresnahan (1982).
Internationally, the literature is vast, and Bikker et al. (2012) offers a comprehensive survey of the
literature developed around the world.
    It is important to note that use of the PR model as a measure of market power has some
caveats because it does not have a monotonic relationship with the degree of market power (Panzar
& Rosse, 1987; Bikker et al., 2012; Cardoso et al., 2016). In addition, their results are obtained
under a very restrictive set of assumptions, such as long-term equilibrium. In the same way, the
model is quite sensitive to variables and specification used on estimation (Hyde & Perloff, 1995;
Bikker et al., 2012). All these issues weaken the evidence of market power found from its results.
    Given this context, we will use a new class of models to measure the degree of market power
proposed by Kumbhakar et al. (2012) and based on stochastic boundary analysis techniques (SFA).
The SFA models have several advantages when compared to the traditional models of literature
known as New Industrial Empirical Organization (NEIO) and allow estimating, in a single model,
a unified structure, a mark-up measure and an indicator of market power. Also, we can obtain
measures of elasticity, return to scale, and efficiency.
    Among the main advantages of SFA models, it is possible to emphasize the flexibility and the
low requirement of information for estimations of the models. The method also allows estimating
market power with or without constant returns to scale and provides an estimate of the degree
of market power in the same style as the Lerner index (Lerner, 1934), thereby circumventing the
critique of the use of H as a monotonic measure of the degree of competition. Another advantage
of the method is that, unlike most NEIO models, this measure of market power is not only an
estimate of the average parameter of the competition level of the industry, but the method also
allows estimating a measure of the degree of market power per bank and over time. In the same
way, it is possible to estimate the returns to the banks’ scale. Finally, the SFA technique allows
the parameter of market power to be a function of deterministic variables.
    One of the pioneering works using SFA techniques in the banking industry is the work of

                                                  4
Coccorese (2014). In this article, the author estimates the Lerner index for each bank individually
for a group of countries between 1994 and 2012, with the results being broadly comparable with
the traditional NEIO models. More recently, Das & Kumbhakar (2016) have also used this class
of models to investigate the market power of Indian banks. We can found others papers that use
SFA to estimate market power such as Bairagi & Azzam (2014), Scalco et al. (2017), Lopez et al.
(2018) and Kabir & Worthington (2017)
    We use this model to evaluate the effect of prudential measures on the bank’s market power.
Combining an SFA method with data on prudential measures, we can estimate these effects. We
use prudential measures as explanatory variables for the market power parameter that we estimate
in the SFA.

3. Empirical Method
   Our empirical model follows the models proposed by Coccorese (2014) and Das & Kumbhakar
(2016). However, we incorporate the possibility that the mark-up has two components, a purely
stochastic and a deterministic part. The derivation of the model starts from the equilibrium
condition that for a profit-maximizing bank (P ) will be greater than or equal to its Marginal Cost
(M C):

                                              P ≥ MC                                              (1)
   The distance between P and M C determines the degree of market power of the bank. After
                                                               ∂C
some simple algebraic manipulations and considering that M C = ∂Y we can rewrite eq (1) as
                                            TR      ∂lnC
                                                 ≥       ,                                         (2)
                                             C      ∂lnY
where T R = P ·Y is the total revenue, and C represent the total cost. The relationship established
in equation (2) states that in the same way as price deviates from its marginal cost, the revenue-cost
ratio of the bank (T R/C) detracts from its cost-elasticity.
    The inequality in equation (2) can be solved by adding a non-negative term u. Thus:
                                       TR     ∂lnC
                                RC ≡        =        + u, u ≥ 0.                                 (3)
                                        C      ∂lnY
                                               ∂lnC
    RC is the observed revenue-cost ratio and ∂lnY  is the cost-elasticity. The non-negative term u
represents the mark-up of the bank, however, it can not be calculated using the bank’s accounting
data because the cost elasticity, unlike RC, must be calculated from a cost function. In addi-
tion, the revenue-cost ratio can be affected by other unobserved variables. To accommodate this
assumption, we add a random error term i.i.d. v to equation (3):
                                             ∂lnC
                                       RC =        + u + v.                                   (4)
                                            ∂lnY
    As equation (4) has been defined, we need to specify a cost function to estimate the term
u, that is, we are using a dual approach in the context of production theory. Kumbhakar et al.
(2012) show, however, that SFA models can use both the dual and primal approaches to estimate
market power. In the dual approach the total cost of the bank depends on the output quantity and
input prices and the primal approach, we can specify a production function (or an input-distance
function), where the output is a function of only input quantities. This flexibility is essential


                                                  5
because unlike many examples, in the banking industry, we do not have information available on
input prices.
     Thus, like Das & Kumbhakar (2016), we use the primal form as an alternative to the dual form.
We start from the specification of a transformation function, defined as Af (x, Y, T ) = 1, where
f (·) is a production function for a given technology, Y is the quantity produced, x is the quantity
vector of inputs used, T is a trend variable, capturing technological changes and A is a parameter
of neutral technological shift.
     Using a set of appropriate identification restrictions (Kumbhakar, 2012) we can derive a function
input distance (IDF) from the transformation function, given by xJ = Ah(x̃, Y, T ), or ln xJ =
                                 x
Ah(ln x̃, ln Y, T ), where x̃j = xJj , j = 1, 2, . . . , J −1. The IDF uses the normalization that f (x, Y, T )
                                        P ∂lnf
is homogeneous of degree −1 i.e. j ∂lnx          j
                                                    = −1.
     Assuming that banks minimize the cost subject to technology specified by the production
function, the Lagrangian for the minimization can be defined as

                                      L = w’x + λ(Af (x, Y, T ) − 1),                                                (5)
where w is a vector of input prices and the corresponding first order condition is:

                                                ∂f (·)
                                    wj = −λA           ,       j = 1, 2, . . . , J.                                  (6)
                                                 ∂xj

   Multiplying and dividing both sides by xj and f (·) and rearranging terms, we can rewrite
equation (6) as:

                                     ∂f (·) xj             ∂lnf (·)
                  wj xj = −λAf (·)              = −λAf (·)          ,                 j = 1, 2, . . . , J            (7)
                                      ∂xj f (·)             ∂lnxj
and if we take the sum of all inputs equation (7) becomes:
                      J                         J
                      X                         X ∂lnf (·)                       C          1
                 C≡          wj xj = −λAf (·)                   ⇒ −λA =               · PJ ∂lnf (·) .                (8)

    From the envelop Theorem, we have that the marginal cost (M C) is                        ∂L
                                                                                             ∂Y

If we use equation (8) we can express it as:

                          ∂C Y   ∂lnC    ∂lnf (·)       1         ∂lnf (·)

    Equation 9 states that the Cost Elasticity (EC ) equals Product elasticity (EY ) which can be
calculated from the parameters of the distance input function (IDF). This result is important

   The advantage of estimating equation (10), rather than equation (4), is that we can estimate
mark-ups without the need for input and output prices, that is, we only need the information on
revenue and total cost of banks and the respective input quantities.

    As highlighted by Kumbhakar et al. (2012), once that we are interested in estimating the
individual mark-up of each bank, we need to focus only on (13) without the need to estimate the
full distance input function, defined by (11). Besides, since the compound error term (ε = u + v) is
the same in the SFA models, we use the Maximum Likelihood method to estimate the model (14).
For this, it is necessary to assume a hypothesis about the distribution of the two components.
    We follow the literature and assume that the random error component v is independent and
identically distributed with a normal distribution, zero mean and constant variance, that is, v ∼
N (0, σv2 ). On the other hand, for the nonnegative component, u, representing the banks’ mark-up,
we extend the models of by Coccorese (2014) and Das & Kumbhakar (2016) and separating the
deviation from the competitive frontier in a deterministic part, which is a function of a vector of
explanatory variables Z’, of the purely stochastic part.
    Following the SFA literature, we estimate the deterministic component of mark-up simultane-
ously with the parameters of the (13), in the same way as Lopez et al. (2018). This procedure
reduces possibility of bias of the estimates when the stochastic term includes determinants of
deviations. Thus, the mark-up (u) in (13) can be represented by

                                                 u = Z’δ + ω                                   (14)
where ω is the stochastic component of mark-up and is defined by a truncated normal distribution
with zero mean and constant variance, σω2 , such that ω ≥ -Z’δ. Therefore the mark-up (u) follows
a distribution u ∼ N + (Z’δ, σω2 ).
   Combining equations (13) and (14), the model we estimate is as follows:

    In order to verify the impact of prudential measures on the degree of competition, we have
included the measures Cerutti et al. (2016) as determinants of mark-up, in addition to a measure
of concentration, represented by the HHI, calculated from the total assets of the banks.
    To measure the degree of power of each bank, we use the traditional measure defined by Lerner
(1934),

if L = 0, P = M C and for any value L > 0, P > M C. In the limit, L = 1.
    The connection between the SFA model (equation 15) and the Lerner index, is done rearranging
the equation (4). Omitting the error term (v) for simplification we can rewrite equation 4 as:

   Equation (18) corresponds to an alternative definition of mark-up, called θ, where the distance
between price and marginal cost is expressed as a fraction of the latter. In addition, since the
function input distance is dual the cost function, we can substitute EC for EY in equation (18)
and, after estimating equation (15) and obtain estimates of the mark-up (û), the estimation of
market power can be obtained by replacing the values estimated in equation (18) as follow:
                           P − MC                     û

  This estimate can be used to obtain the traditional measure of Lerner index, as in equation (15),
employing the following formula:

                                                          θ̂

    Finally, we can use the estimates of equation 15 to obtain other characteristics of technology,
                                                                     ∂lnC     ∂C
such as the return to scale and the scale bias. Formally, EC = ∂lnY       = ( ∂Y )(Y /C) = M C/AC,
where AC represents the average cost. This means that the return to scale is inversely related to
cost elasticity, that is, RT S = E1C . If EC = 1 we will have constant returns to scale, if EC < 1 we
will have increasing returns (economies of scale) and if (EC > 1) we will have decreasing returns
(diseconomies of scale). Again, using the duality condition between IDF and the cost function, we
can use the estimates of equation (15) to calculate the return to scale and scale bias. Respectively:

that technological change is reducing economies of scale over time.

4. Database and empirical approach
    The database used can be divided into two parts. The first part includes the information of
all FI authorized to operate in Brazil by the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB). This information is
available on the BCB’s website through the IF.data system and contains detailed information on
the balance sheet, income statement, and credit portfolio of all IFs. In addition, data are available
on an individual basis, as well as on financial conglomerates and prudential conglomerates. For
this work, we use the concept of financial conglomerates. In December 2018, there was information
on a total of 2,753 IFs between commercial banks, or multiple banks with and without commercial
portfolios, credit cooperatives, development banks, among others, arranged quarterly, since the
first quarter of 2000.
    The second database was obtained from Cerutti et al. (2016). They collect data about change
and intensity in the use of a set of prudential instruments classified as micro-prudential and macro-
prudential for 64 countries with a quarterly period covering the period between the first quarter
of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 2014. The original instruments of the database are the capital
requirement, capital buffer, interbank exposure limit, concentration limit, maximum loan amount,
commonly known as Loan-to-value, and reserve requirement and the information on intensity and
change in prudential measures is collected as follows by the researchers: if the financial regulator
tightens the instrument in question in a specific quarter, the index assumes a value of +1. On the
other hand, if the same instrument undergoes relaxation or loosening, the value of −1. Finally, the
index receives a value of zero if there was no change in the prudential instrument in that quarter1 .
    Not all the instruments available on the original basis were used because some measures were not
implemented by the BCB. Examples are the capital buffer for real estate credit, the concentration
limit of banks to sectors or borrowers, and the limit on interbank exposure. Moreover, due to
the low variability in most measures and the semi-annual structure of the database obtained in
the BCB, we chose to use the cumulative indexes of variation. According to Cerutti et al. (2016),
the purpose of this cumulative index is to capture the level of tightness or looseness over a given
period. Finally, to capture an overall measure of prudential instruments, we aggregate all variations
of prudential instruments into a single aggregate instrument called cumulative prudential. Table
A.5, attached, illustrates the change and the intensity of the prudential instruments implemented
by Brazil, according to the data collected by Cerutti et al. (2016).
    Our sample was restricted only to commercial banks or multiple banks with commercial port-
folios and savings banks. Banks with loan portfolio equal zero and did not contain information for
at least three consecutive years were excluded. In the same way we excluded banks with observa-
tions that fell bellow 1st percentile of the sample for each one of variables used in the model, or
above 99th percentile only for the dependent variable RC = T R/C. Furthermore a further reason
to use semi-annual data is because inconsistencies we have found in some quarterly accounting
data. Therefore, our data correspond to June and December base dates. After applying all these
criteria, our sample was restricted to a panel with only 83 banks, between the first half of 2000

and the second half of 2014, totaling 1,818 observations. In terms of representativeness our sample
corresponded to 79.4% of the total assets and 81.7% of the credit portfolio of the entire SFN in
December 20142 .
    Our empirical strategy consists in estimating the equation (15) by Maximum Likelihood in
a two-stage procedure, wherein the first stage we obtain the estimates of the parameters of the
equation and in the second stage, we calculate the estimates of ûit , using the conditional mean
estimator of Jondrow et al. (1982). After obtaining the estimates of û and RC   d ≡ ÊY , we use
equation (19) to calculate the estimated values of θ, which are used to calculate e the Lerner Index
(L), according to equation (20).
    We estimated six models wif different sets of deterministic variables (prudential measures) to
control the parameter of market power (uit ). In the first model, we did not add any controls. In
the second we include only the HHI. In the third specification, we include the capital buffer and
capital requirement. The fourth model uses only the loan-to-value. In the fifth model, we include
reserve requirements in both foreign and local currency and in the last model, we include the
cumulative prudential measure which is the sum of the changes in all other prudential measures.
    We summarize the description of the variables that we will use in the estimation of equation (15)
and how we calculate them in Table 1. All variables included in equation (15), except for trend,
prudential variables an HHI are in the logarithms form.

5. Empirical Results
    We present the results of the models in Table 2. Initially, focusing on the interpretation of the
parameters of the input-distance function, we verified that the size of the FI credit portfolio (lnY )
has a negative sign, but it was significant only for models 1, 4 and 5. This result implies that the
larger the portfolio size, the lower the revenue-cost ratio of the FI.
    The coefficients of Staff costs (lnx̃1 ) and volume of funding (lnx̃2 ) were also negative and
significant in all models. Thus the higher the staff costs, and the higher the funding volume,
the lower the cost-to-cost ratio of the FIs. The trend variable, as established by equation 22,
represents the scale bias and the negative sign would indicate that technological change would
increase economies of scale, over time, however, no estimate was significant.

5.1. Impact of Prudential Measures on Mark-up
    The evaluation of the variables that determine the mark-up parameter (û) shows that all of
them are statistically significant and positive. The SFA model is not linear in these parameters.
Therefore, the value of the coefficients does not represent the effect of the magnitude of changes in
the variables on the mark-up (their elasticities). However, we can estimate their marginal effects.
We present them for each variable in Figure 1.
    The positive sign of HHI in model 2 means that the more concentrated the banking industry is,
the higher the market power of FIs. This result is in line with that established by the traditional
structure-conduct-performance paradigm. However, is important highlight the increase in the
concentration index coincides with the tightening of the prudential measures stemming from the
GFC. In this sense, we can not say whether this is the real effect of the increase in market
concentration on the market power of FIs, or whether it is affected by the tightening of prudential
measures.
    If we focus on prudential instruments, the results for capital buffers and the capital requirement
(model 3) indicate that a tightening in these variables - whose purpose is to increase banks’ capital
reserve during positive shocks in the economy - has a detrimental effect on competition market
since they raise the IF mark-ups. This effect happens because this prudential measure influences
the smoothing of the credit supply cycle.
    The same results are present for the loan-to-value variable (model 4). In general, this measure
sets limits on the leverage of mortgages and other securities, and a tightening in ltv is effective in
controlling possible booms in the real estate market by reducing real estate prices and ultimately
reducing the excess volatility of the economy (Zhang & Zoli, 2016; Ely et al., 2019). According to
the result found, the higher the limits, the greater the market power of the FIs.
    With respect to reserve requirements both in foreign and local currency - credit limits directly
in foreign currency and domestic currency, respectively - the results (model 5) also demonstrate
a detrimental effect on competition since the tightening in such measures also implies an increase
mark-up of IFs. In the model 6, where we introduce the aggregate prudential measure, the result
found is similar to the others, that is, the higher the tightness (in general) in the prudential
measures of the financial system, the higher the market power of FIs.
    Unfortunately, since prudential variables represent only a measure of tightening or loosening of
prudential policy and not its magnitude, we can not accurately assess the impact of these variables
on the mark-up. The marginal effects represented in Figure 1 give us only an idea of how such
variables affected the estimated mark-ups. However, in general, we can say that the positive signs
of the estimates mean that the higher the tightness in these prudential policies, the greater the

mark-up and, consequently, the higher the market power of the FIs. Therefore, we find a perverse
effect on industry competition and probably a loss of borrowers welfare.
    Our results are in accordance with the evidence that the increase in prudential rigor has negative
impacts, mainly on the supply of credit (Lim et al., 2011; Claessens, 2015; Aiyar et al., 2014; Gropp
et al., 2018; Cerutti et al., 2017). Ceteris paribus the increase of IF mark-ups would be a fully
expected effect. As highlighted by Claessens & Laeven (2004), any policy that restricts the activity
of banks and hinders their operation has negative impacts on market competition.

5.2. Estimation of Lerner indices
    Regarding the mark-up estimation, the values reported at the bottom of Table 2 correspond
to the distance between the observed revenue-cost ratio and its competitive boundary, that is, the
component û.
    To interpret the mark-up, however, we will focus the discussion on the estimates of Lerner
index (equation 20) because they have a more unambiguous economic meaning. We summarize
the results of Lerner index for general estimates, by type of control and for each model in Table 3
and the Figure 2 shows their frequency distributions 3 .

    We should emphasize that these estimates are individuals, that is, we obtain the estimates for each

    For all six models, all mark-up estimates were within the theoretical range of 0 and 1, with the
minimum value being 0.009 (model 2) and the maximum value 0.362 (model 3). In general, the
estimated average value was between 0.051 (model 2) and 0.058 (models 1 and 5), which means
that, on average, Brazilian banks have a mark-up between 5.1% and 5.8%. These values are slightly
different when we separate the estimates by type of control.
    In the case of state-owned banks, the average mark-up was between 0.047 (model 2) and 0.057
(model 1). These values are lower, in all the estimated models, to the values of (privates) national
banks (0.052-0.057) and foreign banks (0.050-0.061). However, the medians of estimated values
for state-owned banks were higher than the national and foreign private banks in all models.
    For comparison purposes, these values are considerably lower than the value (0.16) estimated for
Brazil in Coccorese (2014). However we believe that this difference is due to the model and sample
used. Coccorese (2014) has estimated the dual version of model (equation 4) and, as highlighted by
Kumbhakar et al. (2012), the use of accounting information to calculate input prices can generate
problems when they are endogenous. Regarding the sample, Coccorese (2014) also used a different
period from ours (1994 to 2012) and a more significant number of FIs in the sample (189, against
83 used by us). The main difference here is in the number of IF - 106 in total. In this respect, it is
essential to note that these FIs constitute small FIs and in the second half of 2014 they held only

    We tried to replicated the Coccorese’ sample but in preliminary tests we have found great
difficulties in the models estimations, in particular, at convergence of likelihood function. We
observed these small IFs had, in several situations, extremely high values for the revenue-cost ratio,
or excessively low for the inputs used (personnel expenses and funding), as well as other problems
such as launch errors (positive values in variables of expenditure, for example) and missings. For
these reasons, and considering that such IFs represented only a small fraction of Brazilian credit
market, we decided to exclude them from the sample. However, it is worth highlight as they
are small FIs the vast majority operate in particular segments of the credit market and probably
assume a more risk-taking behavior. Considering that they will work with a segment of credit
claimants with ”worse scores” than borrowers using large FIs we expect that the mark-up of these
IFs will be higher.

   Regardless of this, our results seem to adhere well to reality, because if we look at Figure 3, we
note that the Lerner indices show a significant increase from the second semester of 2008. These
results are in agreement with the results of Cubillas & Suárez (2018). Besides, in Figure 4, Lerner
indexes are separated by type of control, and we can observe that, with some exceptions, the
market power has always been lower for state-owned banks, especially considering the period after
the GFC.

5.3. Estimation of Returns to Scale
    Finally, Table 4 and Figure 5 summarize the estimates of returns to scale. We highlight that
the average of the returns to the scale of the Brazilian FIs is very close if we comparer the six
estimated models (between 0.848 and 0.851). Although the values are close to unity, in all IFs
we reject the hypotheses of constant returns to the scale, that is, RTS = 1, therefore IFs have
diseconomies of scale.

    When we separate estimates by type of control, the estimates of state-owned banks (0.937-
0.944) are higher than national (0.824-0.829) and foreign banks (0.841-0.844). This result means
that the scale problem is a problem common to all FIs in Brazil. Moreover state-owned banks runs
closer to the constant return region than national and foreign banks.

6. Final Considerations
    Considering that the banking industry underwent a significant restructuring in recent years,
caused by several mergers and acquisitions in the sector, as well as by a severe financial crisis
started in mid 2007 and potentialized in 2008, understand the behavior of market power and as a
(partial) set of prudential instruments influencing this dynamic has become paramount. Thus, in
an innovative way this paper proposed the use of stochastic frontier analysis techniques to measure
market power for the Brazilian banking industry and to test if such prudential measures had an
impact on the competitive dynamics of sector.
    The estimated average Lerner index was between 5.1% and 5.8% for Brazilian FIs. However,
when controlled by the type of control, we find that state-owned banks have slightly lower estimates
than national and foreign banks, respectively. Also, estimates of returns to scale allow us to infer

that FIs operate with diseconomies of scale.
    Concerning the impact of prudential measures on the market power of FIs, our results generally
suggest that tightening of prudential measures have a positive impact on bank mark-up and,
consequently, have detrimental effects on competition in industry banking. Finally, in future
research, it will be possible to better understand the influence of some prudential measures in the
banking market, through the study by type of segment or line of credit.
