           This paper estimates the impact of a compulsory transfer from central to local
       governments on the official index of basic education quality, IDEB, and on the
       variables that compose the index : passing rate and scores on a standardized exam.
       The identification hypothesis uses a rule of a federal transference to municipalities
       according to population brackets, which ensures an exogenous variation on the
       estimation of a Regression in a Discontinuity Design (RDD). The results indicate
       that the transfer has positive effects on IDEB of first cycle primary schools, especially
       on second grade passing rate, but also on mathematics and Portuguese scores.

1       Introduction
    In recent years, the debate on the need to increase public spending on education
was intensified in Brazil. This defense based the approval of National Education Plan
(PNE - PL 8035/10) by National Congress, which states that the spending on education,
as a percentage of the GDP, will be at least 10% in ten years (Law 13005, 2014).
There is controversy, however, if the increase on education spending is sufficient to
increase its quality. On the other hand, federal government publicly released in 2007
a standard national index for the basic education accountability, IDEB1 , calculated for all
Brazilian elementary schools and also for the municipal public schools jointly. The index
is calculated from the passing rate and the scores of students in a national exam, Prova
Brasil (Fernandes, 2007).
    There is little evidence on significant effects of public spending on IDEB. Menezes-Filho
and Amaral (2008), for example, used panel data of Brazilian municipalities to estimate
this effect, but the identification hypothesis was not robust to estimate a causal impact.
In general, the endogeneity issues hinders the determination of the causal effect. Our
paper is the first to examine the effect of public spending on IDEB using a Regression
Discontinuity Design - RDD. Our methodology consists in analyzing the effect of a federal
transfer to municipalities, FPM2 , which is done according to certain population brackets
and generates exogenous variations on local expenditures near the thresholds. There
are several evidences, using RDD method, that FPM impacts on local social spending,
especially on education and health (Brollo et al, 2013; Arvate et al, 2013).
    FPM is distributed according to a compulsory and unconditional transfer rule, that is,
the transfer is done monthly in an automated manner and the transfer is not conditioned
to any specific destination. At first, the municipality share on FPM fund depends on
factors that can not be influenced by politicians (Finance Ministry, 2012a). This legal
distribution rule provides an exogenous variation on certain population groups, allowing
the identification of the causal impact of the transfer on education quality in cities near
the thresholds. Thus, we use a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to identify the
causal effect of the transfer on student outcomes.
    Litschig and Morrison (2013) is the most close to us. The authors use the same
discontinuity rule to analyze the effects of FPM on education over 1982-1985, when the rule
was a bit different from the present. From the 1980 and 1981 census data, plus information
on municipal finances, the authors estimate a positive effect on literacy rate and years
of schooling due to one thousand reais per capita transferred. The authors argue that
more budget expenditures may result on higher quality of education, through increased
spending on education, but also by spending on areas such as health, child education and
transportation - which may indirectly impact on student cognitive capacity. Healthier
children, for example, have better conditions to have a good academic performance. A
good public transportation system, on the other hand, can reduce the cost of access to
school.
    Public basic education in Brazil is funded in different ways. The vast majority of
schools of this level are municipal, funded through the budget of the municipalities,
either through local taxes, or through transfers from federal entities, such as Fundo de
Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica e Valorização do Magistério3 (FUNDEB) and FPM

(Oliveira and Santana, 2010). In general, public finance literature points to the need for
decentralization of education spending because local governments have more condition
to assess local population demands. In addition, it is considered that the expenses of
different cities among different social areas depend on the preference of each electorate
(Tiebout, 1956).
    Many empirical studies do not find positive significant effect of per student spending on
performance measured by standardized tests (Menezes-Filho and Amaral, 2008; Chaudhary,
2009). However, these results do not show conclusively that per student spending does not
affect student achievement. Joint deployment of different policies within an educational
sphere may cause adverse impacts. Thus, the simple increase on per student spending
does not guarantee better performance because this effect depends on the combination of
various inputs and practices adopted (Hanushek, 1989).
    In Brazil, most studies coincide with the international literature that highlights the
family background as the major determinant of years of schooling and cognitive learning
(Barros et al, 2001; Menezes-Filho and Amaral, 2008; Diaz, 2012). Diaz (2012) does not
find impacts of municipal education spending on 2005 IDEB (Basic Education Development
Index), as Menezes-Filho and Amaral (2008), who also use 2007 and 2009 IDEB. Using a
quantile regression, the authors find that cities that benefit from spending increases are
those with higher fourth grade scores. Barros et al (2001) shows that family background
is correlated with the average schooling in years of study. Furthermore, the author
finds evidence of a negative relationship between labor market attraction and years of
schooling. The quality of educational services do not seem to explain school attendance.
Menezes-Filho and Pazello (2004), in turn, estimate a significant impact of a 90 decade
educational transfer on proficiency, and there is indirect evidence that this occurred due
to school and teacher improvements.
    We describe in the next section the data used in the regressions. We resume in section
3 the theoretical literature on school performance determinants and we suggest a simple
model to interpret the estimated effects. Section 4 introduces the strategy to be adopted
to identify the causal effect of FPM on IDEB and details the equations to be estimated.
Section 5 analyzes the validity of the assumptions necessary for causal identification. In
section 6 we analyze in detail the results and in section 7 we make the closing remarks.


2         Database
    We use information about FPM shares of Brazilian municipalities with up to 30,000
inhabitants in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011 available on Finance System of Brazil (FINBRA)
- Accounting Data of Municipalities, of National Treasury Secretariat (STN). The municipalities
declare independently expenditures on different functions and the amounts of FPM received
to a federal bank, while National Treasury Secretariat (STN) compiles such information.
We update the values in reais (R$) to January of 2014 using the official rate of inflation
- IPCA4 , calculated by the federal institute of statistics, IBGE5 .
    Supplementary Law No. 91 of 1997 established a formula applied to the FPM transfers
for part of the municipalities, the financial reducer, which was calculated from 2000 to
2007. The FPM is transferred according to municipal population brackets, but municipalities
that lost population in the 90s had their transfers unchanged. The reducer gradually

adjusted the FPM distributed to those municipalities to the annual population estimated
by the IBGE.
    We also use the federal government official index for basic education accountability,
IDEB, calculated for the municipal elementary schools. The index, released in 2007
by Ministery of Education to assess the quality of brazilian basic schools, is calculated
separately for the first cycle, corresponding to the current first grade to the fifth of primary
education, and for the second cycle, extending from the sixth grade to the ninth. We also
analyze the impact on two variables that compose the index: the passing rate and the
average scores on Portuguese and Mathematics in Prova Brasil exam, evaluation created
in 1995 under the basic education evaluation system, SAEB6 . This test is applied every
2 years to all students of the fifth and ninth grades, and follows the Item Response
Theory (IRT), making possible to monitor the progress of municipal public schools over the
years. The IDEB for each school is calculated by multiplying the performance indicator
(indicator constructed from the passing rate) by the average score of the grades evaluated
in Prova Brasil7 . The IDEB was calculated for the years 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011.
    However, there is evidence that this is not a good indicator of the education quality
offered by the school, the school-effect, because the index is quite correlated with the
socioeconomic characteristics of the students’ families (Soares and Alves, 2012, 2013;
Portela and Curi, 2012). Thus, its utility as a form of accountability and encourage
competition between schools is limited (Alves and Soares, 2013). We must consider that
the indicator represents the interaction between various factors that affect learning, such
as family background and the characteristics of schools and education management in a
city.



3         Basic model of learning
    The empirical evidences for Brazil point to a great importance of the students’ families
conditions on IDEB results. On the other hand, there are situations in which schools
contribute to student cognitive achievement by providing appropriate conditions and
incentives for learning (Soares and Alves, 2013).
    Theoretical models in education consider that cognitive learning can be expressed
as a function of school characteristics and socioeconomic conditions of students’ families
(Cunha, Heckman and Schennach, 2010; Carvalho Filho and Litschig, 2013). The distribution
of these variables over the schools reveals a synthetic picture of education in a municipality
(Epple and Romano, 1998).
    We consider a simplified model in which cognitive achievement is a function of schools
and students’ families background:

        IDEB = q(S(s, Gpii , ν), B(f, Gp−i
                                        −i
                                           , η))

    IDEB score of municipal elementary schools is given by q, a function relating the inputs
of education to cognitive proficiency in a given municipality. S(s, Gpii , ν) determines the
impact of public school resources on IDEB. s is a vector of variables that affect the quality
of school teaching and can not be influenced by the government, such as the organization
    6
        Sistema de Avaliação do Ensino Básico, in Portuguese.
    7
        More information on the calculation of IDEB can be found in Fernandes (2007).



                                                     4
of teacher unions and the technology available for teaching. pi is the cost of school
resources, as teacher wages, and Gi is the municipal expenditure on education. Gpii is the
supply of educational resources, as school physical infrastructure and qualified teachers.
ν is a idiosyncratic term of teaching quality offered by the municipality, not correlated
with the other variables.
    B(f, Gp−−ii , η) is a function relating family characteristics and IDEB. f is a vector that
summarizes the city social and economic conditions that are not influenced by the mayors,
as macroeconomic conditions of all the country. Gp−−ii represents all municipal expenditures
in real terms not made on education, which can directly influence the families and impact
on academic achievement capacity, such as spending on health. η is a idiosyncratic term
of local socioeconomic conditions, not correlated with the other variables.
    For simplicity, we consider that expenditures are made on education and health. The
analyses can be directly extended to more functions. A simplified local budget constraint
                              P
can be expressed as G = Gj = Gi + G−i = I + T , where I is the sum of municipal taxes
and fees and T is the amount of FPM transferred. We consider a linear specification for
the education production function and that q is a identity function:

   S(s, Gi , ν) = δ0 + δ1 s + δ2 Gpii + ν

   B(f, G−i , η) = γ0 + γ1 f + γ2 Gp−−ii + η

   δ2 and γ2 are indicators of spending efficiency on education and health systems,
respectively, in terms of impacts on IDEB. The index of local public education, IDEB,
can be expressed as:

   IDEB = δ0 + γ0 + δ1 s + γ1 f + δ2 Gpii + γ2 Gp−−ii + ν + η

    We consider an exogenous variation on FPM transfer, T, and that spending on function
i can be expressed as a function of this transfer: Gi = β0 + βi T . βi is correlated with local
preferences for goods of function i, which should be a function of δ2 in a more general
framework. IDEB can be rewritten as:

   IDEB = Θ + Γ + ϕT
                                    γ2                                    δ2 βi       γ2 β−i
   Where Θ = δ0 + γ0 + ( δp2i +    p− i
                                        )β0 ,   Γ = δ1 s + γ1 f and ϕ =    pi
                                                                                  +    p−i


   We estimate the effect of an exogenous variation of T on IDEB as:
                                                            γ2 β−i
   E(IDEB|G = I + T ) − E(Q|G = I) = ( δ2pβi i +             p−i
                                                                   )T

    The impact of FPM on IDEB depends on two channels. The first corresponds to the
effects on the quality of teaching. The effect of education spending on school quality is
summarized by the parameter δ2 , weighted by the cost of goods in education, pi , and the
additional amount invested in education is givens by βi T .
    On the other hand, additional FPM increases spending on other social areas. The
impact of public health provision on student learning capacity is expressed as γ2 and β−i
is the electorate preferences for health services. In a more general setting, the parameters
of education production function must be non-linearly related, which implies interactions

between school and family effects, as well as between spending on different functions.


4    Econometric Methodology
    The methodology used to estimate the causal effect of an involuntary and unconditional
transfer, FPM, on local public education, measured by IDEB, uses the legal rule of
transference according to population brackets. We argue that this legislation ensures
a random variation of FPM near the thresholds, which prevents the pre-selection of
municipalities or rule deviations.
    There is some evidence of population manipulation (Monasterio, 2013), but this possibility,
made legally or not by local politicians or government bureaucrats, is limited and marginal,
ensuring the RDD estimation (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). Municipalities can receive more
FPM if the population grow enough to change the population brackets stipulated by the
law. More than that, the population is estimated based on population growth estimated
by IBGE, which depends on the variation between the two previous population counts
(IBGE, 2013). So, the ability of actual politicians manipulate population growth is very
low and, principally, not complete, which validate the RDD estimations (Lee and Lemieux,
2010). In order to exclude this limited possility of influence, we perform regressions with
fixed effects, using a panel of municipalities over the years, to use the continuous variation
of population over the years as the forcing variable of FPM variation.
    This quasi-natural experiment allows us to asses whether more money available to
municipalities in fact causes an improvement on the quality of education. An ordinary
regression indicates only correlation between the variables and may hide other variables
correlated with the size of population - for example, per capita income or the competition
between schools. We consider that these correlations can be approximated by continuous
functions in cities with similar populations.
    The increase of population to a point above the thresholds provides a significant
increase on per capita FPM received by these municipalities. The real effect of FPM
per capita on IDEB is equal to the potential IDEB when the city do not have the money
plus the IDEB difference relative to when the city receives the transfer. The identification
problem is that we do not observe the potential effect of treatment for all municipalities,
but only for the treatment group. Thus, we can not guarantee, in a regression with all
municipalities, the balancing of potential effects, on average, between the treatment and
control groups .
    The only factor that determines the change on transfers outlined in this paper is
the city population. Whereas transfers follow a continuous distribution conditional on
local population, unless exceptionally in the thresholds, the effect can be estimated by a
regression of the transfer on IDEB in a vicinity of the thresholds, that are 10,189; 13,585;
16,981 and 23,773 inhabitants. The population rule is not the only variable used for FPM
transfer, so the instrument effect is heterogeneous among municipalities - basically, it also
depends on the state to which the municipality belongs.
    In order to compare the effectiveness of FPM Legislation, we calculate, for each
municipality, the amount that should have been transferred following the established
rules, the theoretical FPM. This value depends on four variables: the total for the FPM
in Brazil; the state coefficient, according to the Court’s resolution (TCU) No 242/90; the
county coefficient, established by Decree Law No. 1,881 / 1981; the sum of the coefficients
of state’s municipalities; and the financial reducer which lasted until 2007, determined by
Complementary Law No. 91/1997 (Ministry of Finance, 2007). The total for the FPM

                                             6
corresponds to 23.5% of Income Tax and Excise Tax8 collected by the Union. 86.4% of
this total are destined to municipalities of the interior and with population fewer than
142,633 inhabitants, and the remaining amount is distributed between the capitals and
cities with more than 142.633 inhabitants (Ministry of Finance, 2012a). The reducer is
applied to a portion of the municipalities which were identified as population size lower
than had been estimated on 1996 IBGE Population Count (Ministry of Finance, 2012b).
    We implement RDD through a 2nd Stage Least Squares Regression (2SLS), wherein
the theoretical FPM is used as the instrument in the first stage, as performed in Brollo
et al(2013), following the methodology exposed in Angrist and Lavy (1999). Following
this approach, we present estimates using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), and also using
the panel regressions in Fixed Effects. The estimation of the RDD in a fuzzy design
can be consistently estimated using 2SLS (Imbens and Lemieux, 2007; Angrist and Lavy,
1999). The 2SLS regression ensures efficient estimation if some assumptions about the
distribution of standard deviations is attended (Wooldrigde, 2002).
    In the first stage, we regress the value of FPM per capita declared by the mayors on
theoretical FPM per capita, that is, the value that should have been transferred if there
were no deviations from the rule. The specification of the first stage can be described as:

      F P M = π0 + π1 F P M teorico + π2 gn (pop) + v

    All the variables were taken into logaritmos. π 0 s are coefficients to be estimated.
gn (pop) is a polynomial of degree n of the local population and FPMteorico is the FPM
calculated to be distributed to the municipality, according to the legal rules. The second
stage checks the impact of FPM per capita estimated on the first stage, FPM ∗ , on school
performance measured by IDEB:

      IDEB = α0 + α1 gn (pop) + α2 F P M ∗ + u

    where the dependent variable is IDEB or one of its components: passing rates and
scores in Portuguese and mathematics in a national exam. (F P M )∗ is the per capita
amount provided by the first stage and α2 is the estimated coefficient of interest. All
variables were log-transformed, with the exception of theoretical FPM and the population
polynomial. Estimator variances are clustered by municipality and corrected to the
generated estimator.
    We use a 2SLS specification with Fixed Effects as a robustness test, to explore the
variation of treatment status over the years, as local politicians can not completely
control population growth, validating RDD estimations (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). We
estimate regressions using a 500 inhabitants windows around the thresholds and a 2
degree population polynomial. We performed additional specifications where we consider
variations on the estimation windows and on the population polynomial degree, but the
results overall were very similar and were omitted.

5     Testing the identification hypothesis
5.1    FPM transfer rule
    The main hypothesis of identification is that FPM transferred to Brazilian cities may
be considered exogenous in certain ranges aroun the population thresholds. Assuming
that the variables correlated with the FPM and the quality of education follow continuous
distributions over the thresholds, and so are balanced compared to the instrument change,
the local impact of FPM can be estimated using the IDEB variation in these regions
(Imbens and Lemieux, 2007).
    Figure 1 shows the FPM per capita discontinuities on population thresholds. Smaller
cities are most dependent on FPM because the larger cities have a higher potential of own
revenue, through municipal taxes. In addition, as the population coefficients are constants
within each band, cities with smaller population within each group receive more per capita
FPM.

    Figure 2 shows the effect of population coefficient variation on FPM per capita received
by brazilian municipalities with up to 30,000 inhabitants, estimated by local linear regressions
on the left and on the right of the thresholds and using a 500 inhabitants window. The
increase in FPM per capita is strong, especially on first and second thresholds, and
statistically significant at 95 % confidence.

5.2    Pre-treatment covariates balancing
    We use as covariates, to verify the balancing of treatment and control groups, educational
information from the regions of the current municipalities in 1970, when the population
thresholds for FPM transfers were different. We test if the educational conditions between
actual treatment and control municipalities previously diverged. A similar strategy was
used by Litschig and Morrison (2013), whom don’t find differences due to the population
brackets on literacy rate in 1980, but the authors used only the cities which frontiers were
unchanged during the period. As many cities has been created in Hrazil during the 90
decade, we prefer to compare actual municipalities by the geographic area they belonged in
1970 and still belong now, the 1970 Minimum Comparable Areas (AMCs), because many

of them have emancipated or had their frontiers modified during the last decades9 . We
analyze the educational conditions of AMCs in the 70’s through the variables illiteracy
rate, evasion rate, and average years of schooling and of age/grade lagging. Thus, we
test if the municipalities of treatment and control groups in 2005 were in AMCs that
were significantly different in terms of educational outcomes in 1970, before the actual
thresholds have been established.
    Table 1 shows the results for the municipalities in 2005 that were in the population
windows considered on the regressions. We consider windows of 500 inhabitants around
the actual thresholds, and compare the pairs of values - the first with the second, the third
with the fourth through the eight windows. The 70’s AMCs of treatment and control cities
did not diverged previously on any educational factors analyzed by considering the four
pairs of population windows.
    We performed bilateral t-Student tests, which do not reject, by 10% of significance,
the null hypothesis that the means of adjacent windows are equal for all variable. We
cannot reject the null hypothesis at 5 % for any specification using unilateral tests. The
number of municipalities in 2005 who were in treatment and control groups for each of
the 4 considered groups, also were not substantially different. These results are evidence
that the cities were previously balanced in terms of education’s characteristic between
treatment and control before the thresholds have been defined.

     The number of municipalities increased from 3.951 in 1970 to 5.507 em 2000. To more informations

6     Results
6.1    FPM effect on IDEB using municipalities with less than
       30,000 inhabitants
    Table 2 presents the results of OLS (OLS), Fixed Effects (FE) and Least Squares 2
Stages (2SLS) regressions using all municipalities with less than 30,000 inhabitants. The
variable of interest is the effect of FPM per capita on IDEB calculated for the first and
second cycle of municipal elementary school, but we also use the passing rate in each
grade and the standardized average score on Portuguese and Mathematics in Prova Brasil
as dependents variables. This exam is applied on last grades of first and second cycles,
namely the fifth and ninth year.
    The results show a strong impact of FPM on passing rates. For the first cycle, the
greatest impact occurs in the second grade, where 1% increase in FPM per capita increases
by about 13% the probability of passing the grade, when we consider the OLS and 2SLS
regressions. When we consider the results by Fixed Effect, this impact increases to 19%.
Fixed effects method eliminates omitted variables that are constant over time that may
bias the result (Wooldrigde, 2002), so in this case its estimating the impact of population
coefficient changing during the period. The impact on the average passing rate in the first
cycle ranges from 8.44% in OLS model to 14.45% in Fixed Effects model. The impact
on scores, even though significant at 1%, is considerably smaller than the impact on
passing rates. Again, the greatest effects on first cycle scores occur using Fixed Effects
regressions: about 0.18% on math note, 0.13 % on Portuguese, 0.24% on the average
grade of the subjects and 0.43% on the aggregate index IDEB.
    The impacts estimated for the second cycle are still significant, but the absolute values
are small. The effect on passing rates varies from 2.63% to 3.33% using OLS regressions,

which occurs in the third grade of the cycle. Using Fixed Effect regressions, the values
range from 5.4% in the fourth grade to 8.4% in the first. 2SLS estimates, in which we use
the theoretical FPM as an instrument for the declared FPM, have intermediate values
between OLS and Fixed Effect, but also indicate a positive effect on first grade passing
rate of 7.23%. The average impact in the second cycle passing rate as a whole is 8.16%
in the more robust specification (FE), 5.81% in IV estimations and just 3.05% with OLS
estimations.

    The effect on second cycle scores are very small numerically, but significant with 1%
of significance. OLS regressions indicate an effect of 0.03% on math, 0.05% on Portuguese
and 0.07% on the mean score. Fixed Effects estimates are 0.04% on Portuguese, 0.09%
on mathematics and 0.12% on the mean score, which are lower than those found in 2SLS
estimations: 0.08% , 0.09% and 0.14% on Portuguese, mathematics and mean score,
respectively. The effect on IDEB index using OLS regressions is only 0.11%, while using
2SLS regression method is 0.21% and 0.22% with Fixed Effects model.

6.2    FPM impacts on IDEB using a discontinuity design
    Table 3 shows the effect of FPM per capita on IDEB of first and second primary
school cycle and on its components, estimated by 2SLS regressions in which we explore
the discontinuity due to FPM rule. The instrument considered is the theoretical FPM per
capita, and the regressions are made in a window of 500 inhabitants around the thresholds.
    The results indicate a significant effect of FPM on all components of the index in the
first cycle, especially in the groups of cities with population around 13,585 and 16,981
inhabitants. Column 1 shows positive effects of a 1% increase of FPM per capita on first
grade cycle passing rate, specially in cities with about 23,773 and 13,584 inhabitants,
about 16.71% and 7.68% respectively, but there is also a significant impact with 10% of
significance in the first threshold, 5.64%.
    The impacts on passing rates of the first cycle follow the pattern observed with all data
and are concentrated in the second grade. The estimated effects, significant at 1%, shown
in column 2 are 22.83%, 26.11%, 34.88%, 28.44% to the threshold 1 to 4, respectively,
which indicate a strong numerical effect on first cycle passing rates, even in this robust
specification. The impacts on the third, fourth and fifth grades are concentrated in
intermediate-size cities, especially in the fourth grade, whose passing rate increases 17.94%
in cities with about 16,981 inhabitants.

    The effects on scores in the first cycle are smaller than the impact on passing rates,
but are significant at 1% in all regressions. The largest effects on scores occur in the group
of cities with biggest population, perhaps because they have better conditions to improve
education quality, due to economies of scale, for example. Considering the cities with
population close to 23,773 inhabitants, the effects are 0.31% 0.23% to 0.40% on scores in
Portuguese, mathematics and on the mean score of the subjects, respectively. For all the
thresholds, the effects on IDEB is greater than the estimated effects in the regressions
with all the towns smaller than 30,000 inhabitants (Table 1), ranging from 0.47% to 0.61%
for each 1% transferred via FPM per capita.
    The effects on the second cycle are again smaller. There are no significant impacts on
the passing rates in any grade and for all the thresholds. The effects are concentrated on
scores, especially in Portuguese. There is a 0.16% increase in the mean score in the first
group and 0.17% in the third - significant values at 5%. Impacts on global index IDEB
range from 0.16% to 0.25%, significant values at 5%, but there is no impact on the group
of cities with more population.
    We present robust estimates using 2 Stages Least Squares controlling for municipality
Fixed Effects in Table 4. In this case, we estimate the impact of population coefficient
transition and hence the impact of an exogenous FPM variation on municipal IDEB
variation. This shift depends on the population growth estimated by IBGE from previous
counts, which can not be completely influenced by the actual mayor, ensuring a continuous
variation of the forcing variable. The identification of the treatment in this case is
possible even with population manipulation, since the mayors and politicians do not have
a complete control of this process (Van der Klaauw, 2002; Lee and Lemiuex, 2010).
    The results indicate an even greater effect on the overall first cycle passing rate, ranging
from 19.42% to 26.85%. Again, there is no effect on the first grade passing rate, unless in
the first population group, and the effect on passing rates is concentrated in the second
grade, about 30% in the first threshold and reaching 44.7% in the largest population
group. Its effects on passing rates for the third, fourth and fifth grades of the first cycle
are not much larger than the 2SLS specification without fixed effects, and the values are
generally significant at 1%.
    The effects on the first cycle scores, on the other hand, are generally smaller than
estimated in the foregoing specification. The effects on the mean score in Portuguese and
mathematics in Prova Brasil vary between 0.27% to 0.34% for each 1% increase in FPM
per capita. The overall effect on IDEB, using 2SLS in Fixed Effects, has the greatest
values of all used specifications, ranging from 0.53% to 0.6%, probably due to the strong
impacts on passing rates.
    The results for the second cycle follow the pattern of the previous 2SLS results without
fixed effects correction. The effects on passing rate are not significant at 1%, except for
the second grade (or sixth year of primary school) of municipalities with population close
to 16,981, about 17.26%. The effect on second cycle passing rate is positive, significant
at 5%, and ranges from 7.97 % to 14.98 %, except for the largest population group. The
effects on scores is positive and similar to those previously estimated. The effect on IDEB
reaches 0.35%. The results for cities with population of about 23,773 are insignificant for
all dependent variables used.
    The robust specification confirm that the effect of additional FPM concentrates on the
first cycle of basic education. In 2006, the Senate approved the Law n 144/2005, which
added one year to the basic education formation, and required the adequacy of states
and municipalities by 2010 - so that the former first grade corresponds to today second

grade. There is a sharp increase on passing rates, specially for the second grade. This
is a indicative that school managers favor the maintenance of children in school at this
stage, and they did not adequate to the new law yet. These results are evidences that
the municipalities concentrate efforts on literacy of young children, while keeping them
at school.

7      Conclusions
    We use a quasi-experiment to measure the effect of an exogenous increase of an
unconditional transfer to municipalities, FPM, on municipal IDEB, the offical index to
measure primary education quality. We explore the institutional rule of distribution
according to population brackets, which allows the estimation of regressions using a
discontinuity design (RDD).
    We find a positive effect of FPM on IDEB, specially in the first cycle. The effect is
concentrated on passing rates, specially in the second grade of the first cycle. Second
grade was the former first grade until 2008, when the government added one year to
primary education and children started going to school one year early. The passing rate
of new first grade, in turn, is the last that has increased due to transferred FPM. These
results suggest that school managers still concentrate their efforts on reducing evasion of
young children, and they have not adapted to the new law yet.
    The positive and significant estimates for all the data are confirmed by more robust
estimations using RDD regressions. The impact on second grade passing rate reaches 48%
in municipalities with about 23,773 inhabitants using 2SLS with fixed effects. Passing
rates in the third and fourth grades increase due to FPM, but at a lower rate than occurs
in the second grade. The lower impact is in first grade, a maximum of 16.71%.
    The effect on Prova Brasil scores, test applied to students of the fifth and ninth
elementary grades, are numerically small, but in general are significant, reaching a maximum
of 0.35%. The effect on the aggregate index IDEB is small but significant in all specifications,
ranging from 0.53% to 0.66% in 2SLS regressions with Fixed Effects, for each 1% increase
on FPM per capita.
    An important question to be investigated further latter is whether spending on functions
other than education, are more efficient to improve the ability of students than spending
on schools and teachers. Health expenditures, for example, which are made especially on
primary care in the cities of our data, positively influence social and health conditions of
families, thus increasing passing rate and the learning capacity of students. The impacts
of health expenditures is crucial because its the second biggest local expenditure, just
after education. We cannot attest causality of education and health spending separately,
because they are all correlated with FPM transfers, but we already did OLS estimations
exploring discontinuity on education and health spending to estimate the correlation
of these particular expenditure and the quality of education. The results suggest that
health expenditures are more efficient to increase education quality than educational
expenditures itself.
