Empirically, we made use of a GMM panel data analysisfor 17 manufacturing sectors in the period among 1996 and 2011.

Resumo    Recentemente, alguns economistas têm apontado um perigoso processo que consiste na perda de competitividade daindústria brasileira causada pela forte apreciação cambial. No entanto, outros economistas têm relacionado esse processo àfraqueza da produtividade industrial brasileira. Neste contexto, o nosso trabalho avalia as diferenças do impacto da taxa decâmbio e da produtividade do trabalho sobre a participação das importações medida aqui pelo coeficiente de penetração dademanda total por bens importados decomposta em setores industriais. Além disso, desenvolvemos um modelo teórico parao entendimento e diferenciação dos de tais impactos. Empiricamente, fizemos uso de uma análise de dados em painel (GMM)considerando 17 setores da indústria transformadora no período entre 1996 e 2011. Nossos resultados sugerem que ambasas variáveis são importantes para explicar a diferença anual do coeficiente de importações. No entanto, a produtividade dotrabalho tem o maior impacto sobre a participação das importações, mesmo quando a avaliação é feita em termos de grupossetoriais.

C231     IntroductionIn the recent years, the competitiveness of the Brazilian manufacturing sector has become a prominent issue inthe national economic debate as a result of a rapid increase of the imports' participation on the domestic marketsince the 90´s. In 1996, imports represented only 6.5% of the domestic consumption of manufactured goods. Thisparticipation soared during the 2000s, reaching 23.0% in 2008, with a small decline in 2011 to 19.5%. According toseveral economists, policymakers and manufacturing associations, this large increase in the imports penetration isto be blamed on the appreciation of the Real.    Indeed, after the 1999 crisis, the Brazilian currency (Real) appreciated in real terms (relative to U.S dollar) by60 percent between 2003 and 2011. According to Armando Monteiro Neto, president of National Confederation ofIndustries (CNI), appreciated exchange rate affects the competitiveness of the Brazilian manufacturing sector notonly abroad, but also inside the domestic market. Furthermore, more than 50% of all industrial segments in 2009faced import competition (Monteiro, 2010).    Cano (2012) and Bresser-Pereira as well as Marconi (2010) also emphasize this aspect, suggesting that the levelof the exchange rate is the main factor behind the loss of competitiveness of the manufacturing sector observedduring the last decade, and warn that it could lead eventually to a process of deindustrialization.                                                             1    There is no doubt that exchange rate has an important impact on the level of competitiveness in Brazilianmanufactured goods.     According to Broz and Frieden (2006) a real appreciation of exchange rate increases thepurchasing power of local residents by lowering the relative price of foreign tradable goods.      These authors alsoemphasize that there is a trade-off between competitiveness and purchasing power and the exchange rate has acrucial role in it.    However, it is important to point out that despite his importance exchange rate is not the only factor that explainthe loss of competitiveness of Brazilian manufactured goods.      Productivity is also a key variable for understandit. Bonelli and Pinheiro (2012) listed direct and indirect factors related to productivity that have constrained theBrazilian competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. For instance, the quality of infrastructure, the investmentsin R&D, absorption of foreign technology, labor cost and the educational level. As consequence, in terms of domesticfactors, not only is exchange rate the key for explaining the increase of import penetration but productivity is also acrucial element. It is convenient to clarify, therefore, what is the factor that has a major role in import penetrationof the demand for manufactured goods.    This article evaluates the broad effect of exchange rate and productivity on the recent dynamic of importpenetration in the Brazilian demand for goods in the manufacturing sectors. Moreover, this paper elucidates whichfactor has the greatest impact.    At first time it is not clear why the impact of exchange rate and productivity on import penetration maydiffer. Considering this aspect we propose a simply micro-funded model demonstrating that under some specificconditions productivity measured by the ratio between industrial production and number of workers could be moreimportant for explaining the increase of import participation on domestic market when compared to exchange rate.The necessary condition that creates this superior impact of labor productivity is a higher participation of foreigninputs on the total production. This theoretical result reinforces the argument of Lisboa and Pessoa (2013) thatdevaluations may protect national industry, but, at the same time, raises the costs of foreign inputs.    To corroborate empirically the difference of impacts we made use of panel data regressions for 17 manufacturingBrazilian sector covering a period between 1996 and 2011. By the fact that there is an eventual simultaneity betweenlabor productivity, exchange rate and import penetration yielding biased estimators, we apply GMM panel dataestimation based on Arellano and Bond (1991).    In particular this method takes the first differences of the variables to eliminate unobserved sector-specific effectsand use lagged instruments to correct for simultaneity. However, as pointed by literature, the lagged instrumentsin the first-difference equation may be weak and may cause large finite-sample biases. To circumvent this problemwe also apply the system GMM panel estimation based on Arellano and Bover (1995) as well as Blundell and Bond(1998).    In this context, our empirical findings confirm that the impact of labor productivity on import penetration issuperior to exchange rate. These result contest the broad argument that exchange rate is the key factor that explainthe massive increase of imports on domestic market between 1996 and 2011. It is also possible to evaluate empiricallywhether this result may be sustained by two distinct groups of sectors that constitute our data: consumption goodssectors as well as intermediate and capital goods sectors. Findings also attest the superior importance of productivityconsidering both groups of sectors.    In the case of consumption goods sectors group the impact of exchange rate on import penetration is slightlysuperior when compared to the results for the whole sectors. On the other hand, the impact of exchange rate ofthe group of intermediate and capital goods sectors is lower but not statistically significant.    As a consequence these results support that fact that exchange rate is not crucial for explaining the increase ofimports participation on the domestic demand for intermediate and capital goods. This last result is important interms of policy given that devaluation of Brazilian currency may not be effective for increase the market share oflocal intermediate and capital goods on the domestic market.    The rest of the paper is organized as follow. Section 2 presents some stylized facts about the relationship betweenimport penetration and labor productivity and real exchange rate. Section 3 presents the micro-funded model thatsupports the theoretical view about the importance of productivity over exchange rate. Section 4 and 5 present,respectively, the empirical model and results. Finally section 6 concludes this article.2     Stylized facts: exchange rate, productivity and import penetrationThe recent process of rapid increase of manufacturing imports in the Brazilian domestic consumption became arelevant issue in the economic debate and exchange rate has turned out to be the key factor for understand it.There are two mainly reasons for that. At first place, economic theory expects that the relationship between importpenetration, measured by the share of imports over the manufacturing apparent consumption, and exchange rateis negative. In general, there is evidence that Brazilian imports react positively when home currency appreciates                                                           2against major foreign currencies. Secondly, over the last 20 years, real exchange rate appreciation reached its lowestlevel. However, despite of the fact that these arguments gained importance on the national debate, there is someaspects related to this process that remains unclear, i.e., the degree of import penetration sensitiveness to exchangerate evaluated at sector level.    A preliminary and basic view of these relationship reveals that the correlation is negative as expected, butwith a small degree. Figure 1(a) presents the dispersion between the log difference of the share of imports in thedomestic market (measured by import penetration coecient calculated at constant prices) and the log differenceof sectoral exchange rate                             1   for 17 manufacturing sectors, during the period between 1997 and 2011. As we observe,the linear relationship is weak and the correlation coecient is only -0.06.                        This characteristic is consequence ofthe low correlation in the group of intermediate and capital goods sectors. Figure 1(c) reveals that those sectorsrelationship between these two variables is slightly positive and near zero.                        Whereas the sectors of consumptiongood industries, as shown in Figure 1(b), has a pronounced relationship and presents a higher degree correlationwith a coecient of -0.21.Figure 1: Dispersion between the annual difference of the import coecient (vertical axis) and the annual growthrate of sectoral exchange rate (horizontal axis) for 17 manufacturing sectors between 1997-2011.                                  1.5                                  1                                  .5                                  0                                  −1 −.5                                           −1.5           −1               −.5                0                   .5                                                         (a) Manufacturing Industry − 17 sectors                                  1                                  .5                                  0                                  −.5                                           −1.5           −1             −.5               0                      .5                                                       (b) Consumption Goods Industry − 7 sectors                                  1.5                                  1                                  .5                                  0                                  −1 −.5                                           −.6         −.4          −.2           0            .2            .4                                                  (c) Intermediate and Capital Goods Industry − 10 sectors    Furthermore, these stylized fact puts in check the effectiveness of devaluation policies for protecting the nationalmanufacturing industry. The exchange rate appears to be important for reducing import penetration in the consumergoods sector. However, this is not true in the case of intermediate and capital goods import penetration. Whetherimport penetration coecient of intermediate and capital goods sectors is indeed inelastic to the exchange rate,currency devaluations elevate input costs and make new investments more expensive.    According to Lisboa and Pessoa (2013) the effect of the exchange rate is ambiguous. Devaluations may protectnational industry, but, at the same time, raises the costs of imported inputs.                          Because of these ambiguity, Broz   1 The sectoral exchange rate is calculated here from the real exchange rate of the Brazilian currency relative to the trading partnersfor 17 industry sectors. measured in terms of consumer prices. weighted by the share of imports of the trading partner in the totalvalue of imports.

In this sense, it is possible that the existence of manufacturing imported goods that are used as input in thenational industry decreases the sensitiveness of import penetration for all industry to the exchange rate. In fact,intermediate and capital goods sectors, in general, has a level of imported input participation on total inputssuperior than consumption goods sectors. According to the databases of input-output matrix estimated by differentauthors for the period between 2000-2009 (Freitas et all 2012; Guilhoto and Sesso Filho, 2010; Martinez, 2015)the sectors present in these group has, on average, a participation of around 16% imported inputs in total inputsdemanded in final production against a percentage of 8.0% in the consumption goods sectors.   On the other hand, some economists have explained the recent raise of import penetration by emphasizing the roleof productivity performance (Bonelli and Pessoa, 2010; Ferreira and Fragelli, 2011). According to Lisboa and Pessoa(2013), while certain sectors in the decade of 2000 were favored by labor productivity gains, for example, agriculture,most of the manufacturing industry sectors showed a poor performance.                       Using data from IBGE manufacturingsurvey (PIM-IBGE), between the years of 2003 and 2011, a period of intense appreciation of the real exchange rate,the industry labor productivity increase only 21%. In particular, labor productivity performance in intermediateand capital goods sector presented a cumulative growth of 18%, while the sectoral exchange rate appreciated 57%.   Whether these segments of economists are correct, we expect that the relationship between import penetrationand productivity would be negative and high correlated. Therefore Figure 2(a) presents the dispersion between thelog difference of import penetration and the log difference of labor productivity for all sectors highlighted here. Infact, a preliminary analysis of the data in Figure 2 reveals that the relationship between these variables are stronglynegative. The correlation coecient is -0.57 for the group of 17 sectors. The same occurs with the two groups ofsectors as seen by Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c). In the case of intermediate and capital goods sector the correlationcoecient is -0.65 and for consumption good sector its value is -0.40.Figure 2: Dispersion between the annual difference of the import coecient (vertical axis) and the annual growthrate of labor productivity (horizontal axis) for 17 manufacturing sectors between 1997-2011.                            1.5                            1                            .5                            0                            −1 −.5                                      −.4       −.2           0             .2            .4           .6                                                  (a) Manufacturing Industry − 17 sectors                            1                            .5                            0                            −.5                                     −.4          −.2             0                 .2                 .4                                                (b) Consumption Good Industry − 7 sectors                            1.5                            1                            .5                            0                            −1 −.5                                      −.4       −.2            0            .2            .4           .6                                            (c) Intermediate and Capital Goods Industry − 10 sectors                                                                   4    The role of productivity seems to be more important than exchange rate for explaining the recent process ofraising in import penetration of manufacturing goods. The stylized facts presented here reveal that this differencemay be related to the presence of intermediate and capital goods imports.                               Apparently, these group of sectorsdo not present any association between import penetration and exchange rate. As a consequence it weakens therelationship for the whole manufacturing sector. We have the impression that the absence of association in thisspecific group may be explained by deeply structural dependence of foreign inputs in the domestic production whencompared to consumption good sectors.    As we may see in the next section, the hypothesis that foreign input dependence weakens exchange rate impactis reasonable when analyzed through a simple micro-funded model. In empirical terms, it is not possible to drawrobust conclusions by a simple analysis of correlation.                   The reverse causality between variables and unobservedsectoral and time effects may be a problem. Furthermore, import penetration may also depend on other importantfactors as we could see in the theoretical model. Thus, all theses aspects demand different econometric treatments.3    Theoretical ModelThis section proposes a simple theoretical model in order to motivate and discuss the main propositions to be testedin this paper. We assume that there are two countries, a domestic and a foreign country, and that the productionfunction of domestic and foreign firms are given, respectively, by:                                                              Y = αL and Y ∗ = α∗ L∗                                                           (1)where   Y   and   Y ∗ denote   the quantities produced in each country and                  α   and   α∗ represent   the labor productivity inthe domestic and foreign industries. We assume that the labor supply is inelastic, so that the                             L   and   L∗ are   bothexogenous variables. Given the price of the domestic good (in national currency),                          P,   the firm's profit is given by:                                                                  π = P αL − wL                                                                (2)where   w   is the nominal wage. Assuming that there is free entry in the industry, the profit of all active firms shouldbe zero. Therefore, the equilibrium price is given by:                                                                             w                                                                       P =                                                                     (3)                                                                             α                     wNote that the term                     α represents the unit labor cost. Similarly, we have that the equilibrium price of the foreing                                         ∗    w∗good (in foreign currency) is given by: P = ∗ .                                              α   Next, suppose that the domestic demand for both the domestic and foreign goods can be derived based on thechoices of a representative consumer with CES utility function given by:                                                             U (Q, Q∗ ) = (Qρ + Q∗ρ )1/ρ                                                       (4)where   ρ ≤ 1 is the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods.

Suppose, without loss of generality, that R = 1,so that his budget constraint is given by:                                                                 P Q + EP ∗ Q∗ ≤ 1                                                             (5)                                                                                                ∗where   E   is the nominal exchange rate.

But does this result make sense? How robust is it?   According to Lisboa and Pessoa (2013), exchange rate depreciation increases the competitiveness of the domesticindustry, but at the same time raise the cost of imported inputs. The model presented above does not capture suchadverse effects of exchange rate depreciation due to the simplistic format assumed for the production function ofdomestic firms. In order to make our analysis more realistic, we extend the previous model, now assuming that theproduction function of domestic firms are given by a Leontief function of the following form:                                                                          ff                                                                        1                                                            Y = α.min L, ι   with φ > 0,                                         (8)                                                                        φwhere   ι   is the quantity of an imported input used in the domestic production, i.e. we are now assuming that theproduction of the domestic good requires the use of a certain quantity of a foreign production factor. Note that theoptimal production requires that:                                                                                     ι = φL                                      (9)since any other combination of production factors would imply in waste of resources. Note that the larger the valueof the parameterφ, the higher the dependence of the domestic industry on the foreign input. Assuming, withoutloss of generality, that the price of the imported production factor is equal to one and imposing the optimalitycondition    ι = φL,    it follows that the profit of domestic firms is given by:                                                                   π = P αL − (w + φE) L                                        (10)Thus, from the zero profit condition, it follows that the equilibrium price of the domestic good is now given by:                                                                                         w + φE                                                                                P =                                             (11)                                                                                            α   Finally, assuming, for simplicity, that both the production structure of the foreign industry and the utilityfunction of the representative consumer remain unchanged, we have that, in equilibrium, the ratio between thedemanded quantities of foreign and domestic goods is given by:                                                                                              !1/1−ρ                                                                                      w+φE                                                                       Q∗               α                                                                          =            Ew∗                                                                                                       ,                        (12)                                                                       Q                α∗which can be re-expressed as:                                               Q∗                                                                                          ∗                                                              1       w + φE                    w                                     log                =        log          − log (E) − log                                   (13)                                               Q            1−ρ         α                      α∗Thus, as long asφ   > 0, the effect of an increase in labor productivity on the relative demand for the foreign good,Q∗   , is larger (in absolute terms) than that of an exchange rate depreciation.

Different from themodel in the last section, our empirical analysis requires additional treatment. Firstly, the data consist of annualinformation for manufacturing sectors considering a specific period. Thus, it is necessary to control for unobservedsectoral effect and time effects that is not treated in the micro model.                    Secondly, disturbances may be possiblyautorregressive given that import penetration shocks may have persistent effect over the years. Third, the ratiobetween the demand of foreign and domestic goods is proxied by the coecient of import penetration. By the end,due to the impossibility of obtaining foreign wage data for the highlighted period, we assume that these variablesare captured by fixed and time effects.      The empirical model, therefore, is considered by the following expression:                                                                               ∗                                       ipt = βα αit + βE Eit + βw wit + βα∗ αit  + γt + (µi + vit )                                                                                                                                        (17)                                                  vit = δvit−1 + εit |δ| < 1 εit ∼ i.i.d      where,   ipit   is the log of coecient of import penetration       i in the year t, αit   is log of domestic labor productivity,Eit   is the log of effective exchange rate,          wit   is log of domestic manufacturing wages by sector,          αit   is the log of aproxy for foreign labor productivity,          γt   is time effect. Of the error components,        µi   is the fixed effect and     vit   is anautorregressive shock.      The presence of persistent shocks       vit   indicate that model (1) may also be described by a dynamic representationaccording to the following expression:                             ipit = π1 ipit−1 + π2 αit + π3 αit−1 + π4 Eit + π5 Eit−1 + π6 wit + π7 wit−1                                                        ∗        ∗                                                                      (18)                                                  +π8 αit + π9 αit−1 + γ̃t + µ̃i + εit    where, π1 = δ , π2 = βα , π3 = −δβα , π4 = βE , π5 = −δβE , π6 = βw , π7 = −δβw , π8 = βα∗ , π9 = −δβα∗ ,γ̃t = γt − δγt−1 and µ̃i = µi (1 − δ). The model (2) is the unrestricted model that has a dynamic process thatincludes a autorregressive component of the import penetration coecient. These aspect associated to the possibilityof reverse causality between variables demand a method of estimation different from Ordinary Least Squared (OLS)and Fixed Effect (FE). The OLS estimator is inconsistent estimator given that                     ipit−1   is correlated to the error termdue to the presence of the fixed effect. Hence, the estimator tend to be biased upward.      On the other hand, the FE estimator corrects this inconsistency by removing the fixed effect.                             However, itpromotes a non-negligible correlation between the transformed autorregressive component of dependent variableand the transformed error term. In addition, OLS and FE estimators do not eliminate the problems of inconsistencygenerated by reverse causality between variables. Notice that the error term may be also correlated to the othersvariables, for example, shocks in import penetration may contemporaneously inuence labor productivity giventhat both variables were constructed from the value of industrial production. Furthermore, the effective exchangerate variable     Eit   is calculated by weighing up real exchange rate of Brazilian trade partners and their participationon the total of imports. Needless to say that real wage may be strongly correlated to the labor productivity. Thus,given those aspects, it is possible that reverse causality may also be a problem in terms of estimation consistency.      In this sense, we also estimate the coecients of equation (2) by Arellano and Bond (1991) or first-differencedGeneralized Method of Moments (GMM). This method yields consistent estimators for dynamic panel models. Itrelaxes the hypothesis of strong exogeneity of variables assuming that they are endogenous, i.e., the variables arecorrelated to the shocks in        t   and previous shocks. However, they are not correlated to forward shocks. Assumingthat, it is possible to use the sequence of lags of the variables in level as instruments, after taking the equation infirst difference to eliminate the fixed effect.      However, the estimator proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) may have lagged instruments that is weaklycorrelated with subsequent first differences variables. This is a case of weak instruments that may cause bias aswell as imprecision when explanation variables are very persistent. According to Bond (2002) it happens when theestimated autorregressive coecient of the dependent variable in first-differenced GMM is near to the within groupscoecient. Blundell and Bond (1998) achieve this result by simulation exercises revealing that, when instrumentsare weak, first-differenced GMM results tend to be biased in the direction of within group estimation.      To solve this problem, Arellano and Bover as well as Blundell and Bond (1998) suggest additional momentconditions by using lagged first-differenced instruments for the equation in levels.                         The system GMM method,therefore, combines lagged level as instruments in the first-differenced equation with lagged first differences variablesas instruments in the level equation. Hence, it is expected that system GMM may cause a dramatic reduction offinite sample bias.                                                                      7    However, our interest lies in the restricted parameters      (βα , βE , βw , βα∗ , δ).   Given the estimated coecients in (2)and the system of equation originated by the autorregressive shocks process, we estimate the restricted parametersby minimum distance method suggested by Blundell, Bond and Meghir (1996).    In possession of these results, we may verify whether our empirical findings are in concordance with the theoreticalmodel discussed previously.5     DataOur data covers the period between 1996 and 2011 as well as 17 manufacturing sectors classified in Table 1.                       Ityields 255 observations. Apart from information about Brazilian manufacturing sectors, our empirical analysis alsodemands information from its foreign trade partners.    The sources of trade partner's information are: World Bank Database (consumer index price and exchange rate)as well as Penn World Table (GDP at chained PPPs and the number of employees). The manufacturing data areobtained from Monthly Manufacturing Survey from Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography  PIM/IBGE(index of the number of employees associated to production. index of real payroll per worker and manufacturingproduction index). Annual Manufacturing Survey from Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography PIA-IBGE(number of employees associated to production and manufacturing value of production) and Aliceweb (Brazilianimports and exports by sector).    From this data we constructed four variables present in the theoretical model: import penetration coecient,real effective exchange rate, Brazilian labor productivity and an index of foreign productivity. Additionally, thereal payroll index, also provided by IBGE, served as a proxy for real wage.    The import coecient was conventionally constructed as the ratio of imported value and the apparent con-sumption. The latter consists of the sum of the industrial production value and imports value subtracted from theexports. All measures are expressed in terms of constant prices.

Theconstruction of real exchange rate is based on consumer prices .                                                                        2    Labor productivity was built from the ratio of the value of industrial production, at 2006 prices, and the numberof employees. We also propose a foreign productivity index as a proxy for trade partner's sector labor productivity.In a similar way to effective real exchange rate, this variable is constructed by weighting the labor productivity oftrading partners in relation to their import's share on the total imports of all sectors.    A detailed description of these variables is following described considering               i   as a indication of manufacturingsector and   t   for year.     ipit = log(importsit / (industrial production valueit + importsit − exportsit )     αit = log(industrial production valueit /number of employees associated to productionit )     Eit = log(real exchangerate (R$/LCU )t × the import's share of trading partners on the total importsit )     αit       ∗          = log(trading partners labor productivityt × the import's share of trading partners on the total importsit )  2 The real exchange rate is calculated for each trading partner through the ratio of the country's consumer price indexes and theBrazilian consumer price index.                                                                8                                       Table 2: Descriptive Statistics (1996-2011)                                           All Manufacturing industries - 17 sectors                                                 ipit    4ipit    4αit     4E it       4wit     4α∗it                                   n            272    255      255       255      255            255                                 mean          0.106 0.071 0.007 -0.033 0.001                   0.022                                median         0.075 0.073 0.007 -0.036 0.002                   0.020                           standard deviation 0.100 0.271 0.123 0.193 0.072                     0.043                                  min          0.001 -1.057 -0.420 -1.281 -0.410                -0.420                                  max          0.434 1.298 0.492 0.452 0.254                     0.268                                          Consumption Goods industries - 7 sectors                                                 ipit    4ipit    4αit     4E it       4wit     4α∗it                                   n            112     105     105       105       105           105                                 mean          0.058 0.062 0.002 -0.048 0.005                   0.024                                median         0.052 0.062 0.008 -0.035 0.005                   0.023                           standard deviation 0.042 0.251 0.096 0.237 0.086                     0.061                                  min          0.001 -0.521 -0.269 -1.281 -0.410                -0.420                                  max          0.219 1.049 0.263 0.452 0.254                     0.268                                   Intermediate and Capital Goods industries - 10 sectors                                                 ipit    4ipit    4αit     4E it       4wit     4α∗it                                   n             160       150      150      150         150      150                                 mean           0.139     0.078    0.011   -0.022      -0.002    0.020                                median          0.101    0.081    0.007    -0.039      0.000    0.019                           standard deviation   0.114     0.284   0.138    0.154       0.060    0.024                                  min           0.008    -1.057   -0.420   -0.518      -0.160   -0.056                                  max           0.434     1.298    0.492    0.428       0.190    0.088A descriptive statistics of the variables, given by Table 2, reinforces the stylized facts about the relationship betweenimport penetration, exchange rate and productivity. The average coecient of import penetration, in the periodbetween 1996 and 2011, was 10.6%.         Note, however, that its average growth rate was 7% per year reecting asubstantial increase of manufacturing imports participation on domestic consumption. It is a similar result whencompared to the two large groups of sectors (consumptions goods as well as intermediate and capital goods).   Otherwise, the average rate of the annual labor productivity did not strictly follow the import penetrationperformance. Considering all sectors, its growth rate was only 0.7% per year. For the sectors of consumption goods,the percentage is even lower, equal to 0.2%, whereas the group of intermediate and capital sectors had an annualgrowth rate of 1.1%.   Real effective exchange rate, by the other hand, had a distinct dynamic. As we may see, Brazilian currencystrongly appreciated, in real terms, against the currencies of its trading partners. In average, the annual rate was-3.3% for all sectors. Considering the group of consumption goods sectors this rate is even inferior, reaching -4.8%per year.   Note that these facts are also compatible with the discussion presented in section 2.                 The increase of importpenetration seems to be related to the low performance of productivity in manufacturing sectors and the trajectoriesappreciation of the exchange rate.   On the other hand, additional aspects deserve attention and may also be important for explaining the advanceof import penetration in domestic consumption. The index of foreign productivity indicates that the partners hada better performance in terms of labor productivity. In general, the annual average growth rate for all sectors wasabout 2.0%. Even when segmented by the two broad groups of sectors the performance per year continues to bepractically the same.   By the end, it is seems that wages do not have a large inuence on the recent diffusion of imports on domesticmarket. It is expected that real wage would have had an increase in this period impacting negatively the Brazilianmanufacturing competitiveness favoring imports. However, the average growth rate of our proxy for real wage wasnear zero. Specifically for the group of intermediate and capital goods sectors, the annual rate was neverthelessnegative.                                                              96     Empirical ResultsThe restricted model described by equation (1) and the unrestricted model (2) are estimated by different methods.The estimation of (1) made use of four approaches in order to evaluate whether the results is inuenced by thepresence of some specific bias as discussed before: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Fixed Effect (FE), GMM indifferences (DIFF-GMM) proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) as well as System GMM (SYS-GMM) proposedby Arellano and Bover (1995) and Bover and Blundell (1998).       After that, the method of minimum distance isapplied for estimating the structural elasticities (2) through the coecients obtained from unrestricted models.    In the first part of Table 3 we present the estimation of unrestricted models coecients considering 17 sectors.We estimate a total of ten models.   All models include year dummies for controlling time effects.    The first twocolumns present the estimation by OLS and FE. In the following columns we report the coecients estimatedby GMM. The difference between them basically lies in the number of system equation and the composition ofinstrumental variables.                                                        10

indicates that models is system GMM.(ii) the models in columns 3 and 7 include t − 2 and earlier lags as instruments and models in columns 4 and 8 include as instruments t − 3 and earlier lags.(iii) the models in columns 5 and 9 include t − 2 and earlier lags as instruments in equation in differences and t − 1 as instruments in the equation in level.(iv) the models in columns 6 and 10 include t − 2 and earlier lags as instruments in equation in differences and t − 1 as instruments in the equation in level, withexception of labor productivity variables where we consider t − 2 as instrument in equation in levels.    In the case of the models among the third and six columns we consider the micro-model hypothesis.                                                       It isassumed that the real effective exchange rate and the foreign labor productivity index are exogenous, i.e., there isno sequence of lag instruments related to these variables in the first difference equation as well as in the equationin levels when the SYS-GMM is considered.    However, the construction of these two variables, as discussed earlier, involves measures that may be correlated                                                                                11to the others variables. The exogeneity of trading partner's exchange rate and their labor productivity, that areused for constructing the variables, is less controversial especially because we are dealing with a level analysis basedin manufacturing sectors.   Thus, we expect that sector shocks on Brazilian import penetration do not inuencecontemporaneous partner's exchanges rates and labor productivity. However, despite of this fact, these two variablesalso depends on the trading partners import's participation on total sector imports that may impose simultaneitybias. For this reason, the models in columns 7 to 10 consider all variable in the system as endogenous.   Furthermore, the composition of instruments is also changed according to the sequence of lags. It may inuencethe validity of instruments as reported by Sargan test of over-identifying restriction, shown in the second part ofTable 3.   In the DIFF-GMM models of the columns 4 and 8, we impose the structure of lags inferior to                            t3     inthe equation in first difference. Taking into account SYS-GMM, we do not change the sequence of instruments inthe first difference equation, imposing lags dated           t2   and earlier. However, in the level equation, the lags of laborproductivity (∆log(αit )) instruments is changed from            t1   to   t2.   In this context, the estimation of all unrestricted models reveals firstly that there is no problem of residual serialcorrelation in lag 2. The null hypothesis is rejected at 10% validating the assumption that import penetration shocksmay be described by an autoregressive process. However, the Sargan tests indicate that there is poor evidence thatinstruments are valid in DIFF-GMM models even when the composite of instruments is dated to                        t3    and earlier.The null hypothesis that instruments are valid is rejected at conventional levels. In addition, our results also suggestthat these instruments are weak.   According to Bond (2002) when the estimated lag coecient of dependent variable in DIFF-GMM models is nearto the same coecient estimated by FE give us evidence that instruments are highly persistence or close to randomwalk processes. As discussed in section 4, it may generate downward bias on the estimator. On the other hand,SYS-GMM exploits additional moment conditions by using lagged first differences as instruments for the equationsin levels. As a result, the autoregressive coecient of dependent variable is higher and lies between FE and OLSestimator as predicted by Bond (2002).           In general, OLS estimator gives an upward bias on the autoregressivecoecient of dependent variable by the presence of sector-specific effect.   Generally, our SYS-GMM estimation model improves the power of Sargan tests. Nevertheless, only two modelsreported in columns 7 and 8 of Table 3 have a p-value superior than 10%.                       Furthermore, the difference Sargantest reveals that additional first difference instruments present in SYS-GMM models are valid at level superior to10%. Note further that the most improvement on p-value of Sargan test occurs when we change the lag of laborproductivity first difference instruments to        t2   in level equation.   In light of this econometrics aspects, unrestricted model estimated by SYS-GMM appear to be reasonable,                                            ∗especially in the case where   Eit   and   yit   are assumed to be endogenous. It may be explained by the presence ofsimultaneous correlation between import penetration variable and trading partners import's participation on total                                                   ∗sector imports used as a weight in    Eit   and   yit   construction.   Despite of the fact that the last SYS-GMM model in Table 3 is preferred to the model in column 6, it doesnot impact decisively the coecients of restricted model. Different from unrestricted models, they are estimatedby minimum distance method as proposed by Bond (2002). Only the coecient associated to the real wage has                                                                                                                                  ∗changed, but not in expressive magnitude.           Thus, regardless the assumption that is made about              Eit    and   yit ,   itdoes not inuence our conclusion about the impact of exchange rate and labor productivity on import penetration.Furthermore, according to COMFAC test, presented in the end of the Table 3, the restrictions imposed by minimumdistance estimation are easily accepted.   As predicted by the micro-model, the impact of domestic labor productivity on import penetration is negativeand superior to exchange rate.       Considering only the SYS-GMM models, the value of productivity coecient isat least three times larger than the exchange rate coecients.                     It is the preliminary evidence supported by themicro-model, i.e., the presence of foreign inputs in the domestic production implies that labor productivity play asuperior role in import penetration when compared to effective real exchange rate.   Some additional aspects of results deserve attention. Our real wage proxy estimator is significant and as expectedhas a positive impact on import penetration. In absolute terms, its impact is also superior to the of exchange rate.More interesting is the fact that the index of foreign labor productivity has the highest impact on the importpenetration. Generally, the estimated elasticity is superior to the unity while domestic labor productivity has avalue near to 0.8. Considering the last model, the ratio between domestic and foreign labor productivity elasticityis around 0.56, a representative percentage.   Our argument that foreign inputs matters to explain why exchange rate is less important than labor productivitylies in the fact that the participation of intermediate and capital goods in the domestic market is inelastic to effectiveexchange rate of the sector. At the moment that national manufacturing industry is deeply dependent of some foreigngoods for producing, it is less likely that changes in the exchange rate may affect their consumption in domesticmarket. It seems the case of intermediate and capital sectors. Table 4 presents the model estimation for these groupthat includes 10 sectors. We impose the exactly structure of lags for instrumental variables presented in all sectors                                                                   12regression shown previously.

the models in columns 6 and 10 include t − 2 and earlier lags as instruments in equation in differences and t − 1 as instruments in theequation in level, with exception of labor productivity variables where we consider t − 2 as instrument in equation in levels.    Our estimated models related to these group have also evidenced that lagged instruments are weak in first                                                                         13difference equation on the method of GMM in differences given that coecient of dependent variable is near to thefixed effect coecient. On the other hand, Sargan tests do not indicate that the over-identifying restrictions arevalid for all GMM models. Additionally, difference Sargan test also reveals that additional moment condition usedin system GMM is accepted at 10% level.      All this aspects reveals that system GMM again yields preferable estimates. However, different from all sectorsmodels, the composition of instruments may change considerably the results of restricted models.                         Notice that,the validity of the restrictions imposed by minimum distance estimation is conditioned to it. Basically the model                                                                                                                                   ∗that only accepts the imposed restriction is the model in column 6. In that case, we assume that                      Eit   and   yit   areexogenous variables.      Even if we take account the last model described in column 10 where the structure of lags is identical to themodel in column 6, but all variables are considered endogenously, there are no substantial changes on the mainlyresults.     The domestic productivity impact is significant and negative.                 The estimated coecient of the foreignproductivity index is positive and significant at 10% level and again has the largest impact among variables. Theunique difference is related to the proxy of wage coecient that is not significant in the model described in column6.      The relevant aspect is the fact that although exchange rate impact is negative as expected, its coecient isnot significant at 10% level. It is means that import penetration of the intermediate and capital good sectors isinsensitive to the exchange rate. This explain why, when we consider all manufacturing sectors, exchange rate hasa limited impact on import penetration coecient when compared to the labor productivity.      Notice that, although the fact that the impact of exchange rate is inelastic for these group of sectors is animportant empirical finding and reveals that the presence of imported inputs may explain this aspect, it does notconfirm that the second order effect of the theoretical model is valid.                    The confirmation that imported input isrelevant for explaining the differential of labor productivity and exchange rate impacts demands that, additionally,the exchange rate elasticity have to be conditioned to the the some measure for the ratio of imported inputs on totalinputs used in these sectors. In empirical terms, it means that we also should incorporate to the model a variablethat is the interaction between exchange rate and the imported input ratio measure. Consequently, it is expectedthat the coecient of these interaction will be positive, i.e., as long as imported input ratio increases it necessarilyreduces the impact of exchange rate on the import penetration.      Table 5 presents the results of the restricted models                                                                   3    and include in its specification the interaction betweeneffective real exchange rate variable and the ratio between the total value of imported input and the value of totalinputs (domestic and imported) used in the production by the sector as a whole obtained by input-output matricesdata estimated by three different sources, Freitas et al (2012), Guilhoto and Sesso Filho (2010) and Martinez (2015).All authors estimate the input-output matrices for the period among 2000 and 2009 for several sectors inclusivethose treated here. Only the matrices of 2000 and 2005 are ocial and provided by IBGE. The imported inputratio   φi   therefore is computed as the average of the available ratios, thus, it means that it is fixed along the yearsand varies according to the sector                                          4.      According to the tests of adequacy associated to unrestricted models in Table 5 we may not find further prob-lems related to serial correlation as well as problems related to the validity of instruments.                   Again, SYS-GMMdemonstrated being the preferable model given that the p-values of Diff-Sargan tests reveals that the hypothesis ofadditional set of instruments is not rejected.      In general, the addition of the variable of interaction do not change considerably the impacts of other variablesspecially the differential of elasticity between domestic labor productivity and exchange rate. Otherwise, the modelsestimated by data from Guilhoto and Sesso Filho (2010) tend to overestimate the coecient of interaction as shownin columns 3 and 6 as well as it makes the real wage coecient insignificant in the former model. Nevertheless,the COMFAC test reveals that the imposed restriction is not valid for these models as well as for all models thatconsider exchange rate and foreign labor productivity as exogenous variables.      On the other hand, COMFAC tests also reveals that imposed restriction is accepted for models that considerexchange rate and foreign labor productivity as endogenous and make use of input-output matrices database fromFreitas et al (2012) and Martinez (2015). Interesting to note that the results are practically identical between thetwo models.      That said, through the results of Table 5 it is possible to confirm our preliminary hypothesis that the reducedelasticity of exchange rate on import penetration is related to the participation of imported input on the total     3 To save space the estimated coecients of unrestricted model that are estimatedby SYS-GMM is not shown on Table 5.     4 Our option for using a fixed imported input ratio based on the avarage ratios ofthe period among 2000 and 2009 is explained bythe fact that there is no input-output matrix estimation for 2010 and 2011. Furthermore, despite the fact that Guilhoto and Sesso Filho(2010) have estimated input-output matrix for the first 4 years (1996-1999), they just only cover 13 sectors. Given this aspects, we haveprefered to proxied imported input ratio by a fixed value along all the period in analysis than lose precious information related to thesectors and time.                                                                   14         Table 5: Restricted Models Estimates - iteration between exchange rate and imported input ratio                                       Eit and α∗it as exogenous instruments       Eit and α∗it as endogenous instruments                                                               Input Imported Ratio by sector - φi                                    Freitas et al     Martinez       Guilhoto    Freitas et al     Martinez       Guilhoto                                       (2012)           (2015)       and Sesso      (2012)          (2015)       and Sesso                                                                   Filho (2010)                                 Filho (2010)                     n                  255              255            255          255             255            255               Instruments               244             244               244            288             288             288             Sargan Statistic          241.89          242.09             244.64        263.41          263.16          272.69            p-valor (Sargan)            0.138           0.136             0.113          0.481          0.486           0.328          p-valor (Diff-Sargan)          0.993          0.993              0.992          0.993           0.994           0.964             p-valor (AR(1))            0.024           0.024             0.021         0.025            0.025           0.021             p-valor (AR(2))            0.167           0.166             0.154         0.161            0.160           0.146                    βα                -0.619***       -0.619***       -0.600***       -0.799***       -0.800***        -0.826***                                        (0.113)         (0.113)        (0.110)          (0.114)         (0.114)         (0.112)                    βE                -0.378***       -0.374***       -0.390***       -0.386***       -0.390***        -0.415***                                        (0.037)         (0.039)        (0.059)          (0.043)         (0.043)         (0.063)                  βE×φ                  1.280**        1.252***       2.571***         2.152***        2.188***        3.230***                                        (0.519)         (0.510)        (0.798)          (0.491)         (0.489)         (0.918)                    βw                 0.468***       0.463***          0.209          0.398***        0.391***         0.316**                                        (0.164)         (0.162)        (0.155)          (0.140)         (0.139)         (0.130)                   βα∗                 1.807***       1.782***        1.518***        1.232***         1.230***        1.148***                                        (0.200)         (0.198)        (0.184)          (0.104)         (0.101)         (0.116)                     ρ                 0.996***       0.996***        0.996***        0.979***         0.979***        0.978***                                        (0.002)         (0.002)        (0.003)          (0.003)         (0.003)         (0.004)             p-valor (COMFAC)            0.001            0.001           0.000           0.225           0.190           0.021(i) All models are estimated by SYS-GMM.(ii) All models include t-2 and earlier lags as instruments in equation in differences and t-1 as instruments in the equation in level, withexception of labor productivity variables as well as the interation between exchange rate variable and imported input ratio where we considert-2 as instrument in equation in levels.                                                                     15inputs. As expected, the coecient of the interaction between effective real exchange rate and input imported ratioby sector   (βE×φ )   is positive and significant for all models. Thus, a higher level of imported inputs ratio in a specificsector implies that exchange rate is less sensitive to import penetration. For instance, the sectors of consumptiongoods, on average, has an imported input ratio of about 0.08 meaning that the elasticity of exchange rate is nearto -0.21 considering models in column 4 e 5. On the other hand, the group of intermediate and capital good sectorshas a ratio of 0.16. As a consequence, the elasticity of exchange rate is near zero, equal to -0.04, a much smallervalue than the group of consumption goods. It is in line with the results of Table 4 where the elasticity of exchangerate is small and statistically non-significant. In fact, the level of imported inputs ratio matters for explaining thedifferential of elasticities.    Notice that when the imported inputs ratio is null, the inuence of exchange rate on penetration coecient isstill lower than the impact of labor productivity. Considering again the model in column 4, even when the importedinputs ratio is zero the elasticity of exchange rate is -0.386 against -0.799 from labor productivity, i.e., the valuesdiffers.    At first moment, these aspect does not invalidate our results though it means that could exist other factors thatinuence the sensitiveness of exchange rate on import penetration than the participation of imported input in totalinput used in the final production.        In this sense, we just only confirm that the presence of imported inputs onproduction partially inuence the impact the exchange rate and most relevant in substantial way.    Furthermore, it is important to point out that although theoretical model predicts that those elasticities havethe same magnitude, it depends on the functional form that we initially assume. Thus, what is important here isthat our empirical findings are in accordance with the mainly results of the micro model that is independent ofinitial conditions, i.e., the signs of all estimated elasticities is coherent with the theory and that imported inputratio matters for explaining the differential of impacts between exchange rate and labor productivity.7     Final Considerations and Policy AnalysisAccording to our empirical findings labor productivity is more important than exchange rate for explaining importpenetration given the period in the recent years. This aspect confirms the view supported by Bonelli and Pessoa(2010) and Ferreira and Fragelli (2011) that the recent progress of imports on Brazilian domestic market is broadlyrelated to the productivity. As we presented before, labor productivity elasticities are considerably superior to theelasticity of exchange rate. The effect of domestic labor productivity on import penetration is at least three timeslarger than the exchange rate, a huge difference. Foreign labor productivity, on the other hand, has the prevalentinuence indicating that there are other distinguished aspects that helps to explain the presence of imported goodson domestic market that do not depend on national economic policies.    Most important is that the differential of impacts is a consequence of the inelasticity of exchange rate to thecoecient of imports from intermediate and capital goods sectors. These inelasticity is supported by the fact thatintermediate and capital goods sectors group have a higher level of imported inputs in the final production. Ourresults revealed that exchange rate elasticity is lower as higher is the participation of imports in the total inputs ofthe sector.    The consequences of the reduced exchange rate effectiveness may be observed when we make an exercise ofsimulation by using the coecients estimated from unrestricted model described in the last column of Table 3.We have simulated trajectories of productivity and exchange rate that is required to generate different importpenetration scenarios considering the period after 2003.           As we said before it is a distinct period and deservesattention because exchange rate suffered an intense process of appreciation of about 62%.               Associated to this,Brazilian manufacturing labor productivity had a poor growth performance. A combination of huge appreciationwith poor productivity performance promoted a massive increase of imports on domestic market.    Scenario 1 consists of forecasts of average levels of import penetration for 2004-2011 considering a constantannual growth rate for labor productivity of 2.5% and of 0% for exchange rate. Scenario 2 is the opposite, i.e., aconstant annual growth of 0% for labor productivity and 2.5% for exchange rate. In all scenarios we made use ofthe observed wage and foreign labor productivity indexes series for the period as well as the estimated fixed effect.The statistics of the simulations are shown in Table 6.    As expected, when we impose the same annual growth rate for both variables considering scenarios where theopposite variable is fixed during all the period, the average level of import penetration is lower when domestic laborproductivity has a positive and constant growth. In these hypothetical scenario the difference in terms of averagelevels of import penetration is about 1.4% and 2.7% in terms of final value.    Otherwise, it is also interesting to calibrate the labor productivity or exchange rate path that is necessary toreach some specific average level of import penetration. This is an important feature in terms of policy. In otherwords, given that government has two variables of policy it should find out what are more ecient for reducing the                                                              16                                                      Table 6: Different Scenarios                                Import Penetration ( /                 Labor          Exchange Rate (% p.y.)                                        100)                       Productivity (%                                                                        p.y.)

This is the case of further scenarios.    Scenarios 3 and 4 are assumed respectively that labor productivity as well as exchange rate are exogenous andhave a constant annual growth rate that is enough to generate an average level of import penetration compatiblewith a 2003 value, i.e., a mean of 0.11 (a target of 11% in the import penetration index) for the period between2004 and 2011. It means an reduction superior than 1 percentage point in the actual import penetration averagelevel of 0.123. In the case of Scenario 3 where no restriction on the exchange rate growth rate is imposed it wasnecessary that labor productivity should have had a constant growth of 4.5% per year. When we execute the sameexercise considering now only exchange rate as the policy variable it would be necessary a annual appreciation rateof only 4.0% per year for achieving the 2003 imports participation target as we observe in the results of scenario 4.    Imposing a more constrained scenarios, i.e., an average level target of 1996-2003 in import penetration (8.8percentage points), the labor productivity growth should had been 11.2% per year according to Scenario 5 whereasexchange rate should have had an appreciation rate of 8.3% each year as observed in Scenario 6.    Notice that different from Scenarios 3 and 4 the last two scenarios are not feasible in terms of policy. It is verydicult to promote policies that yield a labor productivity growth of about 11.2% per year. This is also true andmore complicated in the case exchange rate. During the period of analysis we have seeing a huge appreciation of theBrazilian real exchange rate. In this case, not only should the government had made real exchange rate devaluationbut with a magnitude of about 90 percentage points if we consider the final value of 2011 against the 2003 value.Certainly this policy would had perverse consequences in terms of all economy especially if the nominal exchangerate was the variable of policy.    A huge reduction on import penetration would have demanded not feasible actions when we consider laborproductivity or exchange rate as exclusive variables of policy. There are other aspects that explain the invasion ofimports on Brazilian domestic market as we said before, foreign labor productivity and fixed effects of sectors thatis not manageable in terms of policy. The average growth of foreign labor productivity was 3.3% per year between2004-2011.    For instance, whether instead the foreign labor productivity have had a growth of 0% per year, theaverage level of Brazilian import penetration would have been almost 2 percentage points lower.8     ConclusionThis paper evaluated the inuence of Brazilian labor productivity and exchange rate on the participation of importson the domestic consumption of manufacturing sectors measured by import penetration. We evidenced empiricallythat the importance of labor productivity is superior to real exchange rate.          Furthermore, as predicted by ourtheoretical model, differences of impacts may also be explained by the presence of foreign inputs in the Brazilianmanufacturing production. As long as the sector has a higher participation of imported input on the total of inputsused in production lower is inuence of exchange rate on the import penetration is reduced.    The import penetration of the sectors of intermediate and capital goods is a special case given that the groupis inelastic to the real exchange rate. As we pointed out, these sectors has the largest participation of foreign inputin domestic production when compared to the sectors of consumption goods.    In light of our empirical findings it is possible to conclude that economic policies based on real devaluation                                                                  17inuence the level of import penetration in a moderate way when compared to a policy of increasing domesticlabor productivity.   This conclusion challenges the view that the principal problem faced by Brazilian manufac-turing industry was the appreciation of national currency (real) in relation to the others trade partner currencies.Furthermore, our results also confront the policy prescription for solving this problem.   It is strictly recommended a discretionary policy of currency exchange rate devaluation until a optimum specificvalue.   However, there are some drawbacks regarding to this prescription.      It is commonly accept that makinga real devaluation by an discretionary increase of nominal exchange rate is not easier because of exchange ratepass-through to final prices. In other words, it is not easy make a real devaluation of a currency through nominaldevaluation.   Secondly, an extension of our results indicates that for such economic policy be effective it should focus speciallyon sectors with low imported input ratio which is extremely dicult. Otherwise, whether that policy also impacts thesectors associated to the group of intermediate and capital goods, the impact over import penetration is practicallyzero and may only affect their input costs. As a results, the elevation of the cost of capital goods could cause adecline in the level of investment on the economy.   Finally, not only are labor productivity and exchange rate responsible for the massive increase of import pene-tration. Factors as trade partner productivity and other fixed effect related to sectors are also import. In this sense,some policy target could be not feasible as for example reaching again the average level of import penetration ofthe period 1996-2003 as we demonstrated previously.References [1] ARELLANO, M.; S.
