Resumo: este trabalho analisa evolução do emprego e desemprego no Brasil, com foco nos anos recentes
(após 2010). Estimamos a elasticidade do PIB em relação ao emprego (variante do coeficiente de Okun)
utilizando diversas bases de dados e metodologias. Os resultados indicam que o coeficiente encontrado no
Brasil é próximo dos obtidos por outros autores analisando outros países. A utilização de dados
desagregados para o PIB não altera os resultados de forma significante. O coeficiente de Okun diminuiu
levemente nos últimos anos no Brasil, principalmente a partir de 2011. As horas trabalhadas apresentam
pouca volatilidade no Brasil e o ajuste no emprego ao longo do ciclo econômico ocorre principalmente pelo
ajuste no número de trabalhadores. A criação elevada de emprego nos últimos anos e o baixo crescimento do
PIB representam uma redução da produtividade do trabalho. Esta redução é mais aguda quando se considera
a evolução das horas trabalhadas.



Abstract: this paper analyses the evolution of employment and unemployment in Brazil, particularly in the
recent years (after 2010) using the Okun's laws and some variations of it. Our results indicate that the Okun
coefficient in Brazil is similar to other countries. Using disaggregated data does not lead to an improvement
in the model compared to using aggregated data. The Okun's coefficient diminished slightly in the last years,
particularly after 2011. Average workweek hours presents low cyclicality in Brazil and the labor market
adjustment over the business cycle based mostly on the adjustment of the number of employed workers. The
high number of jobs created over the last years together with weak GDP growth lead decreasing labor
productivity growth. This deceleration in labor productivity growth is clearer when the average workweek per
worker is introduced in the analysis.

                                         Okun’s law and labor productivity in Brazil
1     Introduction
GDP growth between 2011 and 2014 was lower than 2% per year on average. Despite this dismal growth rate,
unemployment reached record low levels. This fact is associated with two related puzzles in Brazilian labor
markets: a) why has unemployment been so much lower despite this low GDP growth and b) why
employment growth did not fall despite this low GDP growth.

The first part of the puzzle is related to the sharp fall in participation rates in Brazil over the last years and also
related to lower population growth. This topic received a lot of attention in the press and will not be discussed
in detail here. We will briefly discuss the reduction in participation rates in the next section. Santos (2013)
discusses this part of the puzzle in more details.

The second part of the puzzle refers to the connection between employment growth and GDP growth. Lower
participation rates explain most of the recent reduction in unemployment rate. However, unusually high
employment growth relative to GDP growth has been mentioned as an explanation for lower unemployment
rate in Brazil recently.

Several explanations arose for this apparent distortion in the "GDP-Employment" relation. The most
prominent explanation was the greater importance of the service sector in the economy. Services are more
labor intensive than industry or agriculture. As GDP grew mostly because of the growth in the services sector,
employment creation was stronger than predicted by the aggregate GDP. Looking at GDP disaggregated by
sectors would undo this apparent puzzle in Brazilian labor statistics.

A more detailed analysis of employment and GDP data (figures 1 and 2) shows that there was no puzzle in the
employment-GDP relation in the last four years. Job creation was high compared to GDP growth in 2012 but
this was reversed in 2013. Figure 1a presents the evolution of GDP and employment growth in Brazil over the
last years. It is clear that employment growth tracks GDP growth. However, the apparent puzzle of strong
employment growth and weak GDP growth in 2012 will probably disappear in 2013 and 2014.

Source: IBGE, Dieese/Seade. GDP is the quarterly GDP growth rate. SDRM and IBGE are the quarterly growth rate of employment
measured by Dieese/Seade and IBGE respectively. IGDP and SGDP are the quarterly growth rate of GDP in the industrial and
services sector respectively.
The smaller deceleration in employment growth in recent years has several explanations including the small
volatility of employment (the deceleration is slower than in GDP), the importance of expectations, among
other factors.

In this paper we estimate the Okun's coefficient for Brazil to discuss the joint evolution of GDP and
employment and unemployment. We start with aggregate data and then apply time-varying techniques to
investigate possible time variation in the relation between employment and GDP. We also estimate the
coefficient using disaggregated GDP growth to evaluate the impact of services GDP in 2012 employment.

Our results indicate that the time-variation in the Okun's coefficient was small and disaggregated data is not a
good explanation for recent employment dynamics. The explanatory power of the disaggregated model is not
statistically different from the model with only aggregated data. Our results do not support the thesis relating
strong employment growth with the increasing share of services in GDP: the employment-GDP elasticity in
the industrial and services sectors are very close to each other.

Our results indicate that the Okun's law is a good framework to forecast job creation in Brazil. However, the
strong relationship between job creation and GDP growth diminished in the last two to three years. Using
GDP disaggregated between services and industrial activities does not lead to an improvement in our results.
Using aggregate hours instead of only aggregate employment leads to a slightly higher employment-GDP
elasticity. This is explained by the reduction in the average workweek in Brazil over the last 15 years.
According to Dieese, the average workweek decreased from ~44 hours in the late 90's to ~41 hours currently.

In the final part of the paper we investigate labor productivity in Brazil over the last years using both the "old"
and the current (or "new") GDP methodology. As A. Okun noted in his seminal work, a strong relation
between unemployment and GDP could be associated with low labor productivity growth: a coefficient close
to 1 in the Okun's law would indicate that GDP growth is being caused only by higher employment level
without any increase in labor productivity. A coefficient lower than one indicates that at least part of the GDP
growth is associated with higher labor productivity. We use this simple extension of Okun's analysis to study
labor productivity in Brazil. Our results indicate that labor productivity growth moved from negative in the
late 90's to positive in the early 2000's. However, productivity growth is decelerating since 2006 and the
average productivity growth rate in the last four years is only half of the productivity growth seen in the last
decade.



2    Data overview
We discuss the evolution of employment in Brazil using mainly Dieese/Seade data. Dieese/Seade data goes
back to 1998 (or earlier depending on the survey) and is more useful to track possible changes in the
parameters we are interested to estimate. This data is also similar to the more conventional measure of
unemployment provided by IBGE. We also use data from IBGE in some estimation. Finally we use data from
Caged as another source of information regarding labor market conditions in Brazil.

The main statistics for labor force and GDP are presented in figure 2. We present summary statistics and
cross-correlation for all seven main variables used in this empirical research. All data refers to the 1Q02 to
2Q13 period. This is the time span for which all data are available. In all cases, the summary statistics refers to
the quarterly growth rate of each variable.

Cross-correlation is high in all cases. The mean growth rate is positive in all cases and volatility is higher in
GDP, particularly industry GDP (IGDP). Means and medians are close to zero for all demeaned variables as
expected.
We will base most of our estimations on growth rates and STM cycles. Growth rates is the most
straightforward method to look at these variables and STM cycle produces the most correlated series. We will
use Dieese/Seade data most of the time since we have a longer span for this data and this will important
considering we are most interested in capturing possible changes in the relation between GDP and
employment.

Employment growth was strong between 2004 and 2011 when it averaged more than 2%. It was weaker
earlier (1999 to 2003) and also weaker in the last two years (2012 and 2013). Other important aspects of
employment growth not captured in figure 1 and table 1 are the difference in employment trends among
different workers groups and sector of the economy.

Employment growth was stronger among services than in industries. This is illustrated in fig. 2. As we
mentioned before, the higher share of jobs being generated in the services activities is often associated with
the higher growth of GDP from services and also associated with higher Okun's coefficient and lower
productivity. Another important aspect of job creation is the last years were the increase in job creation in
construction activity.

Labor force growth decreased from more than 3% in the late 90`s to around 1% over the last two to three
years. This has important implication for unemployment rate: assuming the elasticity of employment to GDP
is 1/3 (this is a good approximation as we will show in the next section), GDP growth necessary to keep
unemployment constant decreased from 9% in the late 90`s to 3% currently. Santos (2013) make the same
observation using a different analysis: according to Santos (2013), if labor force growth after 2004 kept the
same pace observed from 1999 to 2003, unemployment rate would probably not decreased. It means a good
portion of the reduction in unemployment rate over the last 8 to 9 years is related to the slowdown in labor
force growth.

The slowdown in labor force growth has at least two explanations: a) lower growth of working age population
and b) stabilization in participation rates. The working age population evolutes according to fertility rate 14 to
18 year earlier, mortality rate for elderly people, among other factors. In this aspect, the reduction in fertility
rate since the early 90`s is the most important factor. Participation rates increased worldwide in the 80`s and
90`s due to increased female participation rates. This effected faded in 2000`s as female participation rates
reached a plateau. Another important change in participation rates in Brazil was the increase in participation
rates of workers aged 50 or older and the reduction of youth participation rates. For the next years, the
participation rate will probably decrease as the fraction of older workers in the labor force increases. It is
important to mention that at some point in the next years, retirement rules will probably change, increasing the
aggregate participation rate.

These changes in the growth pattern of labor force has a clear impact on the estimated coefficient from the
Okun`s law. Okun (1962) noted this possibility in his work. Due to this impact of labor force on
unemployment we will rely mostly on a modified version of the Okun`s law using employment growth instead
of unemployment rate changes in our estimations.



3     Okun’s law

3.1    Introduction
The Okun`s law relates unemployment to GDP. In its original work, Okun (1962) proposed several simple
models to estimate the relation between unemployment and GDP. The models included the estimation using
growth rates and also deviations from trends. In most of his estimations, he reached coefficients between -0.3
and -0.4: an increase in GDP of 1% is associated with a reduction in unemployment between 0.3 to 0.4
percentage points. Several authors estimated this relation using the same methods or variations of the
methods proposed by Okun (1962). These include IMF (2009) among others. Santos (2013) estimated a
different version based on employment growth rates instead of unemployment using brazilian data. The main
argument for using employment instead of unemployment in growth equation is related to possible time
variations in labor force growth. Labor force growth is probably unrelated to the business cycle but affect
unemployment rate and consequently can distort the estimated impact of GDP growth on unemployment rates.
In this section we update the coefficients estimated by Santos (2013) and discuss two possible variations on
the Okun's coefficient: a) time-varying parameters and b) sector-specific parameters.

The Okun`s law can be written as:

ut − ut −1 = a + by%t + ε t                                                                                      (1)

where ut is the unemployment rate and y%t is the growth rate of GDP (or deviation of GDP from a trend).

We estimate this equation using 1 lag of both unemployment rate and GDP growth using quarterly data. The
estimated equation can be written as:

∆ut = a + φ∆ut −1 + b1 y%t + b1 y%t −1 + ε t                                                                     (1')

The estimation result is:

∆ut = 0.0008+ 0.39 ∆ut −1 − 0.05 y%t − 0.17 y%t −1 + ε t                                                         (1'')
          (0.0004)    (0.09)            (0.03)    (0.03)

σ ε = 0.003, R 2 = 0.59, DW = 2.27, Ω = −0.36

The long-term impact2 by (1'') is Ω = -0.36, similar to what Ball, Leigh and Loungani (2013) find for US and
other countries using a similar methodology. Okun (1962) find a similar value for US.

As discussed previously, the unemployment rate can be affect by changes in the growth rate of population
causing distortions on the coefficients of (1). For this reason we will rely mostly on a different version of (1)
by replacing the unemployment rate by the employment:

e%t = α + β y%t + ε t                                                                                            (2)

where e%t is the growth rate of employment (or deviation of employment from a trend).

We include one lag of employment and one lag of GDP to the equation to incorporate further dynamics into
the model:

e%t = α + φ e%t −1 + β1 y% t + β 2 y%t −1 + ε t                                                                  (2')

Results are presented in Table 2. We estimate (2') using data from both IBGE (1Q02 to 3Q13) and
Dieese/Seade (2Q98 to 3Q13). We present the results found with quarterly growth rates and using the cycle
component from the Structural Time Series model. The results are presented in table 2.

The estimation results indicate that the GDP growth is significant in the employment equation as expected and
most coefficients are significant at the 5% level. The long-term impact is higher when we use Dieese data.
The model adequacy as measured by the adjusted R2 is also higher when Dieese employment data is
employed. The coefficients are close to those presented in Santos (2013).

The long-run coefficient (Ω) is significant at the 5% level in all specifications. The explanatory power of the
model is not big when we use “growth rates” for both dependent and explanatory variables. However, this
model generates residuals that are close to white noise. Using the cyclical component of employment as the

  In dynamic model of the form yt = A(L)yt-1 + B(L)xt, the long-term impact is given by Ω = (1 - A(L)) / B(L).
In (2’): Ω = (1-φ) / (β1 + β2)
dependent variable and the cyclical component of GDP as the explanatory variable increases the fit of the
model as measured by the R2. However, in this case residuals are autocorrelated. Independent of the
transformation used, the estimated long-run impact of GDP on employment is ~0.4x when Dieese/Seade data
is used and ~0.3x when IBGE data is used in the estimations. In the next sub-section we discuss two different
aspects of this relation: a) is there any difference in the employment-GDP relation for different sectors?, b)
how this employment-GDP relation changed over time?

3.2     Time-varying parameters
Changing composition of GDP among sectors, technological progress and other factors may have caused
changes in the Okun's coefficient. Some authors like Ball et al (2013) and Gali et al (2011) include a dummy
variable for recent periods to address this possibility. We use instead a time-varying coefficient approach.

We estimate the model using two quarters average GDP growth. Estimating two parameters like in (2) is
problematic because it would be difficult to make inference about changes in the elasticity of employment to
GDP.

e%t = α + φ e%t −1 + β t ( y% t + y%t −1 ) / 2 + ε t                                                (3)

We also estimate the traditional Okun's relation using time-varying parameters:
ut = a + φ ut −1 + χ t (e%t + e%t −1 ) / 2 + ε t                                                                                                        (3')

To estimate βt and χt, we modeled (3) and (3’) as state-equations and assumed a random-walk transition
equation for both βt and χt. The resulting model can be estimated using the Kalman filter technique.

The estimation result of (3) and (3’) are presented in figures 6A and 6B: the elasticity of employment to GDP
decreased moderately after 2008. It is not clear what could have caused the change in this parameter during
this period. One possible explanation is that firms fired less workers than usual during the crisis and
consequently hired less during the “boom” years that followed. Another possible explanation would be
changes in the methodology used to construct the series but we are not aware of any change in data.

3.3         Disaggregated parameters
A possible explanation for a time-varying parameter at the Okun's law is the reduction in the share of industry
in GDP and the increase of services. Services are more labor intensive and its increasing importance on GDP
could have caused an increase in the Okun's coefficient over time. In Brazil, the acceleration in employment
growth in 2012 despite a severe slowdown in GDP growth was explained using this different impact of
industry and services activities on employment.

σ ε = 0.0056, R 2 = 0.31
Comparing the results from (4') and the first column in Table 2 we can draw some conclusions: a) model fit is
worse using disaggregate data, b) the estimated employment-GDP elasticity are close in the estimations. The
disaggregate model leads to higher residuals and lower R2, indicating that disaggregated information about
GDP does not help to solve the apparent puzzle relating weak GDP growth in the last four years and strong
employment growth. Summing the employment-GDP elasticity of industry and services we reach a coefficient
of 0.44, not much different from the 0.42 presented in Table 2 (first column; Dieese/Seade data from 1998 to
2014, same sample period used in (4')). The services sector in GDP is about 3x the size of the industrial
sector: the services sector represents about 70% of GDP meanwhile the industrial sector represents about
22%. Using RAIS employment data, close to 20% of the workforce is employed in the industrial sector. All in
all, there is some evidence that there is no sensible difference in the employment-GDP elasticity between the
industrial and service sector.

Equation (4) disaggregates GDP by sector but do not disaggregate employment. There are two reason for this:
a) the sectors used in measuring GDP do not exactly match those available for employment, b) disaggregate
employment is not available in the Dieese/Seade data. Despite these difficulties, to dig deeper in this
employment-GDP relation we estimate a simple model with both employment and GDP disaggregated by
sector (services and industry) using employment data provided by IBGE according to this equation:

e%i ,t = α + φ e%i ,t −1 + γ 1 y% i ,t + γ 2 y% i ,t −1 + ε t                                          (5)

where e%i ,t stands for employment growth in services or industry and y% i ,t is the GDP growth in services or
industry. We estimate this equation using data from 3Q02 to 4Q13. The estimation results for the industry
sector is presented in equation (5I) and the estimation results for the service sector is presented in equation
(5S).

The long-run impact of industry GDP on employment at the industry sector is 0.2, similar to what we
estimated using more aggregated data. The individual coefficients are not significant in several cases.

e%I ,t = 0.002 − 0.177e%I ,t −1 + 0.037 y% I ,t + 0.209 y% I ,t −1 + ε t                               (5I)
σ ε = 0.014, R 2 = 0.10, DW = 2.06, Ω = 0.21



The long-run impact of services GDP on employment in the services sector is also close to 0.2. The main
difference between (5I) and (5S) is that the constant coefficient on (5S) is significant at the 5% level and the
constant on (5I) is not significant even at the 10%.

e%S ,t = 0.006 − 0.164e%S ,t −1 − 0.032 y% S ,t + 0.231 y% S ,t −1 + ε t                               (5S)
σ ε = 0.006, R 2 = 0.07, DW = 2.09, Ω =0.17

The general conclusion from this section is that disaggregating employment or GDP does not improve our
understanding of the employment-GDP relation over the business cycle. The difference in employment-GDP
elasticity for different sector is not big and the model fit using disaggregate data is worse. In the next sector
we analyze the relevance of productivity to the evolution of employment in Brazil.
4        Output per workers versus output per hour
In the previous sections we looked at the output-employment relation disregarding any possible cyclical
variation in hours effectively worked. There is an ample literature on the cyclical nature of aggregated hours
of work in US. However, this variable is not commonly mentioned in Brazilian research papers. The main
reason may be the more rigid labor regulation in Brazil and tradition of monthly (instead of hourly) based
salaries in Brazil. The regular workweek in Brazil has 40 hours (8 hours during the 5 business days) and in
some cases it has 44 hours due to a half-day working period on Saturdays. In figure 7 we show the average
workweek in Brazil using Dieese data. The average workweek decreased from about 43.5 hours in the late
90’s to about 41.5 hours currently. This can be related to a smaller share of companies working half-day on
Saturdays or to the increase in the number of part-time workers. A downward trend in hours per week is also
present in IBGE's Monthly Employment Survey and other data sources such as PNAD (Pesquisa Nacional
por Amostra de Domicílio)3.

Figure 7B shows the evolution of workers and average hours per week during the 2008 financial crisis and
during the recent (late 2014 to early 2015) slowdown in GDP growth. It can be seen that the average number
of hours per worker decreased in both cases. To make a better assessment of the response of hours to GDP
growth we will re-estimate the employment-GDP relation. Due to the reduction in average workweek over the
last years we estimate the employment-GDP relation using aggregated hours instead of employment. We also
estimate this relation separately for first and second half of our sample to look for indications of changing
parameters.

multiplying the total number of workers by the average weekly working hours. Both data were provided by
Dieese/Seade. Denoting the growth rate of aggregated hours by ht, we estimate the following equation:

ht = α + φ ht −1 + β1 y%t + β 2 y%t −1 + ε t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       (7)

    Barbosa Filho and Pessoa (2013) discuss the evolution of hours in more detail.
The estimation results are presented in equation (7'):

ht = 0.002− 0.435 ht −1 + 0.153 y%t + 0.519 y%t −1 + ε t                                                               (7')
         (0.002)   (0.114)       (0.139)     (0.139)

σ = 0.012, R 2 = 0.29, DW = 2.15, Ω = 0.47

The estimated long term impact, Ω, is 0.47. This is only slightly higher than the 0.43 estimated using only
employed workers (first column in table 2). Other relevant difference between this equation and the first
column of table 2 is the lower fit of the "hours" model. This can be seen in the larger standard deviation of the
error term and also in the lower R2. In sum, using aggregate hours instead of employed workers does lead to
an improvement in the explanatory power of the model.

Breaking down the sample in two parts does not lead to conclusive results. The estimated elasticity is higher
in the first part of the sample but at the cost of lower model fit.



5       Labor productivity
This final section uses standard growth decomposition to discuss the evolution of labor productivity in Brazil
in the last years. As we mentioned before, the Okun coefficient is closely related to labor productivity: a high
coefficient indicates that a large number of workers (or hours) are required to produce more output.
Consequently, labor productivity is low. On the other hand, a low coefficient may be associated with higher
productivity.

We estimated the evolution of labor productivity in Brazil using the output identity described in Gordon
(2010)4:

         Y H E L                                                                                                       (8)
Y=        ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅N
         H E L N

where Y/H is the output per hour, H/E is the average workweek per employee, E/L is the employment rate
and L/F is the participation rate.

Using lower case to denote growth rates we have:

    y = ( y − h) + ( h − e) + (e − l ) + (l − n) + n                                                                   (9)

Equation (8) decomposes growth into output per hour (or labor productivity) and aggregated hours. The
conventional wisdom (after Okun's seminal work) is that labor productivity accounts for 1/3 of output.

Table 3 presents the results of this decomposition since 1999. Our sample's first full year is 1998, so growth
rates are available since 1999. We broke down the results in average growth rates for 4-years intervals. This is
related to different governments in Brazil and also has the benefit of segregating the most recent years, when
labor productivity apparently decreased (too much workers hired for a small increase in GDP growth).

In table 3A we present the decomposition results up to 2013 using the "old" GDP methodology. In table 3B
we present data up to 2014 using the current (changed in early 2015) GDP data. The current GDP data is

higher than the old one and GDP growth was higher according to the revisited GDP data. However, this
difference is not big enough and in both cases it is possible to see the reduction in labor productivity in Brazil.

At least four important stylized facts can be described using table 3. The first one is the sharp labor force
growth in the 1990's and early 2000's (last column in table 3). This period was marked by high and rising
unemployment rate. Santos (2013) discusses this aspect of labor market in Brazil in more detail. Another
stylized fact is the increase in employment level (E/L) over the last ten years. This fact is also studied by
Santos (2013). The third stylized fact is the downward trend in average hours of work (H/E) we discussed in
previous sections of this paper. The last stylized fact is the rise and fall of labor productivity (Y/H) in Brazil
since the late 90's.

Table 3B shows the GDP growth decomposition using the most recent GDP data. There is only minor
differences between 3A and 3B. The same trends observed in 3A are present in 3B. A possible refinement of
this analysis would be to decompose the variables into trends and cycles. This could indicate if the recent
slowdown in productivity is a new trend or just a cyclical slowdown. Finally, it is important to highlight the
implication of our results to potential GDP growth. The last two columns in table 3 show that working age
population is growing but the growth rate is slowing. This will probably not change in the future. The average
workweek is decreasing. In this situation, it is becoming more important to achieve higher rates of labor
productivity growth to sustain GDP growth. Without higher productivity, Brazil will hardly return to above
4% GDP growth in the coming years.



6    Conclusion
This paper estimates the Okun coefficient for Brazil using data from 1998 to 2013. Our results indicate that
the Okun coefficient for Brazil is close to the ones observed in other countries. Using GDP disaggregated by
sector does not improve the estimation results. On the opposite, using disaggregated GDP data result in a lot
of not statistically significant parameters. Using both employment and GDP disaggregated by sector result in
better model fit. However, the estimated coefficients are not supportive of the view relating strong job
creation to hither Okun's coefficient in the service sector. All in all, our results indicate that the relation
between GDP and job creation weakened in the last years, particularly the contemporaneous and short-term
relation. Job creation was high relative to GDP growth in 2012 but low in 2013. Using the average growth
rates of these variables between 2012 and 2014 eliminates the apparent puzzle of strong job market in a weak
economy.

Using a time-varying parameter model to study the relation between job creation and GDP growth we find a
reduction in the elasticity of job creation to GDP growth after 2010. However, it is not clear if this reduction is
only an artifact of the weakening contemporaneous relation between these variables or a de facto reduction in
this structural relation. This hypothesis is a direction for future research. The fact the reduction occurs at the
end of our sample makes it particularly difficult to study using filtering tools such as the Kalman Filter / time-
varying parameters model. A longer sample will probably help to solve this puzzle in the near future.

Adjusting the employment level by the average workweek does not lead to any clear improvement or
difference in results. The elasticity of hours worked to GDP growth is similar to the elasticity of employment
to GDP growth. The model fit is again lower in the end of our sample.

Finally, our results indicate that labor productivity decreased in Brazil over the last years. This is the strongest
indication that elasticity of job creation to GDP have increased: due to lower labor productivity growth, more
workers are need to produce a one percent GDP growth nowadays than ten years ago. The recent decline in
labor productivity has a cyclical component but most of it comes from more permanent factors: labor
productivity growth is declining since 2005 according to our estimation.
