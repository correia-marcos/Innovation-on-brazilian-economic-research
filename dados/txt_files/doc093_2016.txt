Resumo
A recessão da economia brasileira tem provocado uma intensa discussão a respeito de
estratégias de recuperação da atividade econômica. Este artigo pretende contribuir para o
debate elencando os setores que quando estimulados teriam o maior potencial de retirar a
economia da recessão. Para tal, emprega-se o método eigenvector desenvolvido por
Dietzenbacher (1992). Primeiramente, estimou-se a matriz de insumo-produto brasileira para
o ano de 2013 usando o método elaborado por Guilhoto e Sesso (2005). A partir daí, foi
possível utilizar o método eigenvector para encontrar as ligações intersetoriais para trás. Os
resultados destacam a importância das atividades de refino de petróleo e coque, fabricação de
resinas e elastômeros, produtos e preparações químicas e produtos químicos para estimular a
economia. No entanto, os setores tradicionais de construção e fabricação de automóveis
apresentaram resultados modestos.

Abstract
The current recession in Brazil has provoked intense discussion concerning ways to boost
economic activity. This paper intends to contribute to the debate by ranking the sectors that
have the power to pull the economy out of the recession when they are stimulated, employing
the eigenvector method developed by Dietzenbacher (1992). To that end, we first estimated
the Input-Output Matrix for 2013 applying Guilhoto and Sesso (2005)'s methodology and
build an I-O Matrix from the National Statistical Accounts. Later, we employed the
eigenvector method to find the inter-sector backward linkages and ranked them. The results
highlight the importance of petroleum refining and coke, resin manufacturing and elastomers,
various chemical products and preparations, and chemicals to boost the recovery of the
economy. Nonetheless, the traditional sectors of construction and automotive manufacturing
exhibited poor and modest results respectively.

1. Introduction

The Brazilian economy has presented a sluggish economic performance in the last few years.
Currently the country has entered into a deep recession without any sign of recovery ahead. A
recessionary state followed by rising prices has emerged.
     In this context, 'developmentalism' is a school of economic thought that has suggested
policies to overcome the crisis. 'Developmentalism' has many branches. Two of them are the
'new developmentalism' and 'social-developmentalism'. They have suggested different
policies to stimulate the economy. The former claims that exchange rate devaluation would
pave the way to foster growth. Bresser Pereira (2007, 2011) and Oreiro (2012, 2014) represent
this group. The latter argues that redistribution toward the poor is crucial to stimulate the
domestic market and trigger growth. Bastos (2012) represents 'social-developmentalism'. (For
further discussion, see Amado and Mollo (2015)).
     Arguably a profound knowledge about the productive structure would help to shed light
on sectors that can boost the economy. However, most of the researchers have paid scant
attention to mesoeconomics. In other words, in these proposals lacks an study of the role of
sectors to trigger the economy. Each sector has specific features that should be included in the
analysis.
     In this paper, we built the Input-Output (I-O) Matrix for Brasil for 2013 and applied the
Dietzenbacher (1992)'s eingenvector methodology to rank the sectors in terms of their 'power
of pull' (or backward linkages). We employed the well-known methodology proposed by
Guilhoto and Sesso (2005) to construct an I-O matrix from the National Statistical Accounts.
Having this matrix, we estimate interindustry linkages, giving further information about
sectors' power to pull the economy out of the recession. Following Luo (2013, p. 158), we
define 'power of pull' as the sectors' capacity to pull all the activities through their networks.
Sectors' size and networks matter in determining the effect of one sector on the rest of the
economy. The linkage indicators provide a measure of the total amount of inputs required
from the activities to produce one additional unit of final demand, including the network
effect. The paper also investigates the structural tranformation of the Brazilian economy from
2010 to 2013.
     The eigenvector method presents some advantages in comparison with conventional
methods such as the Rasmussen and Hirschman linkage indicators. The advantages are related
to its sensitivity to structural transformation, capability to find clusters of activities, and it
gives a powerful measure of interactivity linkages. Specifically in this regard, this method
gives a larger weight to the inputs from an activity presenting high backward linkage than
otherwise, representing an efficient procedure to measure interindustry linkages.
    The structural sequencing of the rest of the paper is as follows. Next, we overview the
Brazilian economy during the 2000s. We present a brief review of techniques to measure
backward linkages in Section 2. In the following section, we present the eigenvector method.
The remaining two sections exhibit results and conclusions.

2. The Brazilian Economy in the 2000s: A Brief Overview

The Brazilian economy has grown vigorously since the middle of the 2000s. Between 2004
and 2010, per capita GDP rose by 2.8% per year, even after the effects of the international
financial crisis of 2008. However, despite recovering a certain degree of dynamism, the
country grew slower than in 1950-1973 (United Nations, 2010).
    The international context up to 2008 contributed to the economic results reached in
Brazil. The global economy grew substantially, mainly driven by China and India. In the early
2000s, Brazil benefited from rising exports and increasing international prices. Brazil became
less prone to international crises, receiving large amount of net direct investment. When the
international crisis unfolded, Brazil had international reserves and the capacity to employ
countercyclical policies.
    A crucial feature of the expansion was the development of the domestic market,
containing three central measures. Firstly, the Brazilian government adopted a plan to
stimulate economic development. The Growth Acceleration Plan (PAC) represented the
recovery of the State’s role in planning, coordination of public investments and cooperation
with private firms.
     Secondly, government applied redistributive policies, such as the Bolsa Família, a family
subsidy programme, and real increases in the minimum wage, boosting consumption and
triggering the economy. As a result, an improvement in the income distribution has emerged,
with the Gini coefficient dropping from 0.61 in 1990 to 0.54 in 2009 (IPEA, 2011).
    Thirdly, the rise of credit supply from the financial market was important, with the State-
owned banks leading the process. The amount of credit in relation to GDP surged
considerably from 2000 to 2010.
     The domestic-market-led expansion policy lead to a drop in the unemployment rate. The
rise in formal employment was essential to guarantee political and social stability. Moreover,
reducing inequality can stimulate growth, for two major reasons. Firstly, it improves people’s
nutrition, translating into labour productivity gains. Income redistribution diminishes poverty,
having positive effects on health and education (Deaton, 2003), supporting further increases
in labour productivity. Secondly, it is easier to reach consensus to implement reforms in
egalitarian economies.
     Despite the growth experienced, the persistent exchange rate overvaluation started to
damage industry's performance. To keep momentum, the government gave tax cuts to the
automotive sector and promoted incentives for agglomeration. The development model
achieved its limit by 2014. After 2014, the Brazilian economy began slowing down. In 2015,
Brazil entered into a political and economic crisis followed by a recession, with the collapse
of private and public investment. There is no clear sign that the economy will overcome the
crisis soon.
3. Ranking Sector's Linkages: A Brief Review
In the input-output literature, key sectors are defined as sectors that present high and above
average backward and forward linkages. Several criteria were developed to investigate the
importance of activities to engender economic expansion. Firstly, the simpler method - based
on the Leontief's contribution - involves the sum of lines of the coefficient matrix A to assess
backward (direct) linkages. It represents a measure of the total input required directly to
produce one unit of output. Further extensions employed the Leontief inverse matrix to give
the total effect. The sum of the rows of this matrix gives the direct and indirect (total) inputs
needed as a result of the increase of one unit of final demand. Moreover, there are plenty of
more sophisticated methods: fields of influence (Hewings et al., 1989), triangulation (Korte
and Oberhofer, 1971), hypothetical extraction (Schultz, 1977), and eigenvector method. The
latter presents an advantage since it gives a higher weight to inputs from sectors with high
backward linkage indicators. It is an iterative method, connected to networks. Here, we are
interested in the eigenvector procedure only. Now lets provide a brief introduction about the
backward and forward linkage indicators and review few studies that applied the eigenvector
technique. Our focus here is on the backward linkage indicator.
    One important and well-established method to find direct bacward linkage indicators was
developed by Chenery and Watanabe (C-W) (1958). They worked with the coefficient matrix
A. As before, the row sums indicate the total amount of inputs directly required to produce
one additional unit of output. Mathematicaly, it is represented by the left pre-multiplication of
the A matrix by a unitary vector. The weighted Chenery and Watanabe (1958) direct
backward linkage index (m) can be expressed as
                                              m= ne'A/e'Ae. (1)


Where n is the number of sectors in the economy; e' stands for a row summation vector (ei=1
for all i), A is the input coefficiente matrix, and e is the column summation vector (ei=1 for all
i).
     Rasmussen (1956) worked with the Leontief matrix to design an index of backward
linkages. Its index exhibits how much the output (direcly and indirectly) of the economy
should grow to match an increase in demand in one specific sector. It is represented by the
row sums of the Leontief matrix. The total (indirect plus direct) Rasmussen backward
linkages indicator z can be exhibited as



                                z = ne' ( I − A) −1 /[e' ( I − A) −1 e] (2)

where ( I − A) −1 is the Leontief matrix.

     Conversely, the forward linkage indicators are calculated as a sum of each column in the
Leontief matrix. They show how much a sector will produce (directly and indirectly) when
the demand of all sectors increases by one unit. Overall, key-sectors present high backward
and forward linkages (above average). Here again, our focus is on power of pull so we intend
to look at backward linkages only. Our concern is to investigate sectors' power to pull the
economy out of the recession.
     Now that we have sketched the basic features of backward linkages, we can proceed
reviewing some studies that apply the eigenvector method. Firstly, Dietzenbacher (1992)
measured interindustry linkages for The Netherlands from 1948 to 1984 to rank economic
sectors. He shows that using the eigenvector procedure researchers can find robust estimations
of backward and forward linkages. Moreover, this method is able to detect structural change
and to find clusters of producers. Dietzenbacher shows the method's superiority in comparison
to well-established procedures such as the Chenery and Watanabe (1958) and the Rasmussen
(1956) method.
     Another empirical paper that employes the procedure is Luo (2013). He analyses the
input-output data for U.S. during the 1998-2010 period. His goal was to rank the sectors that
should be first bailed out in the U.S. economy. He also applied a conterfactual analysis to
verify if the government stimulated the right sectors during the great recession of 2008/2009.
His results underscore the necessity to bail out the mothor vehicle sector, but it does not
support bailing out public infrastructure, health care, computer and electronics, and service
sectors. Overall, the author seems sckeptical concerning the policies adopted by president
Obama.
    Other studies concentrate the analysis on inter-industry linkages for regional input-output
(I-O) tables. In particular, Midmore at al. (2006) assess industry linkages through the Welsh
Financial I-O matrix. They employed Dietzenbacher (1992)'s method, finding different ranks
for sectors according to each method applied. Their results underscore the importance of
employing efficient techniques to capture inter-industry linkages, supporting regional
planning.


4. Data and Methodology

This section describes Dietzenbacher (1992)'s eigenvector method. The source of statistical
data comes from the national statistical accounts of the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estatística (IBGE). Because we have only the official I-O table for 2005, the Input-Output
table was derived from national statistical accounts for 2013. The Resources and Uses table
(containing 107 commodities and 51 activities) provides the complete information needed to
construct the I-O table. Specifically, we employed the Resources and Uses Table to built the
input-output (I-O) matrix following Guilhoto and Sesso (2005). For more details, see Morrone
(2015).
     The Input-Output table for Brazil contains 51 sectors. The sectors of the disaggregated I-
O are: agriculture, forestry, and logging (1), livestock and fisheries (2), oil and natural gas (3),
iron ore (4), other mining and quarrying (5), food and beverages (6), tobacco products (7),
textiles (8), articles of apparel and accessories (9), leather goods and footwear (10), wood
products - furniture exclusive (11), pulp and paper products (12), newspapers, magazines, and
discs (13), petroleum refining and coke (14), alcohol (15), chemicals (16), resin
manufacturing and elastomers (17), pharmaceutical products (18), pesticides (19), perfumery
hygiene and cleanliness (20), enamels varnishes paints and lacquers (21), various chemical
products and preparations (22), rubber and plastic (23), cement and other non- metallic
mineral products (24), steel manufacturing and derivatives (25), non- ferrous metallurgy (26),
metal products - except machinery and equipment (27), machinery and equipment including
maintenance and repairs (28), appliances and electronic equipment (29), office machines and
equipment, and electronic materials (30), automotive manufacturing (31), parts and
accessories for motor vehicles (32), other transport equipment (33), furniture and products of
various industries (34), production and distribution of electricity gas water sewage and urban
cleaning (35), construction (36), trade (37), transport storage and postal services (38),
information services (39), financial intermediation, insurance and pension plan, and related
services (40), real estate activities and rentals (41), maintenance and repair services (42),
accommodation and food services (43), business services (44), commercial education (45),
commercial health (46), services rendered to families and associations (47), domestic services
(48), public education (49), public Health (50), and public administration and social security
(51).


4.1 The Eigenvector Method
The Dietzenbacher's method represent an infinite iterative procedure to measure and rank
intersector backward and forward linkage indicators. The method addresses the infinite
iterative process of power of nodes in networks (Luo 2013, p. 160). Here, I borrow notation
from Luo (2013).
     The procedure can be presented as follows. Firstly, suppose ri stands for the vector of
backward linkage indicators of the activities of the economy. Next, the vector ri+1 through an
iterative procedure is updated as the summation of linkages (columns of the input coefficient
matrix A) and it is weighted by the normalized ri from the previous iteration. It makes sense
to give a larger weight to the inputs of the activities with high backward linkages than the
inputs from a sector with a smaller one. The indicators are normalized (to show an average of
1), and can be expressed as
                          ri+1 = nr'iA/(r'iAe)                    (3)



where n stands for the total number of activitities and e is the column summation vector (ei =
1 for all i). The estimation of power indicators is improved through iterations to infinitum
(i→∞).
     Dietzenbacher (1992, p. 420) shown that the outcome of the procedure converges to the
normalized left hand eigenvector which corresponds to the dominant eigenvalue (the Perron
vector) of the matrix A. The weighting vector is estimated as nq'/(q'e) with q'A = λq' (4).
Where q' represents the dominant eigenvalue of A. As a conclusion, the elements of nq'/(q'e)
reveal the power of sectors to pull the activities of the whole economy.
     Note that the "power of pull" (ri) is independent on the original weighting vector
employed. It means that the weighting vector might be chosen arbitrarily in the first iteration.
Moreover, taking the final weighting vector into both equations (1) and (2) implies that the
Chenery-Watanabe index and the Rasmussen index are identical.
     In summary, the eigenvector method considers both inter-sector linkage weighting and
infinite iterative process to capture the influences towards the whole economy. For further
information about this method, its superiority, and mathematical derivation, see
Dietzenbacher (1992). Next, we employ this procedure to measure and to rank interindustry
backward linkages for Brazil for 2013.


5. Results

This section reports on the results of the sector's backward linkage indicators. It serves as a
proxy of the 'power of pull' of the entire economy, revealing sectors that should be bailed out
first during a recession. We rank them according to their capacity to boost economic activity,
leading to a robust recovery. Here the purpose is threefold and displayed in the following
tables. Firstly, we compare the results of the Chenery and Watanabe (C-W) linkage with the
Rasmussen index and the eigenvector's method result. Next, the outcome of the eigenvector
method is analyzed. Then, we follow the ranked sectors from 2010 to 2013 and discuss them
in the context of Brazil.
     Table 1 exhibits the values and rankings of the 20 sectors with the highest Chenery and
Watanabe backward linkages and the Rasmussen and eigenvector indicators for 2013. Results
for the 51 sectors are in the appendix. At the top of the table is Petroleum refining and coke
(14) sector, followed by food and beverages (6), Alcohol (15), and pulp and paper products
(12). These sectors have potential to support the recovery.
    However, a closer look at the numbers reveal that they might be misleading. The
Rasmussen index presents a different sector ranking. For instance pulp and paper products
(12) presents the fourth highest score in the C-W method, but it is the third in the Rasmussen
index. In addition, sector 24 appears among the top 20 using only the Rasmussen index. For
the top 20 sectors in the C-W method, we found a Pearson correlation coefficient of 79.67%
in terms of rank. In conclusion, the results, although close, show some divergence. The high
correlation for C-W and Rasmussen indicators found, shows that there is not much difference
between the two methods.
     Turning now to the eigenvector's elements, we see that the divergence becomes deeper. If
we compare the correlation between C-W and the eigenvector method, the Pearson correlation
coefficient takes the value of only 47.64%. Looking at rank, it drops to 38.37%. For example,
articles of apparel and accessories (9) is only the seventeenth highest C-W score, but it is the
second using the eigenvector method. This sector has medium size, but it is powerful to
stimulate the rest of the economy through the network. It suggests that the C-W procedure
takes into account the size of the sector only, implying crucial negative consequences for
planning. These results are similar and in line with Dietzenbacher (1992), Midmore et al.
(2006), and Luo (2013).
    Last but not least, the Rasmussen index and the eigenvector indicator revealed modest
Pearson correlation coefficients. In a nutshell, it underscores the importance to estimate key
sectors employing efficient methods that detect network power.

     Finally, Table 3 depicts the eigenvector indicators for the top 20 sectors in 2010 and
follows them from 2010 to 2013. The results for the 51 sectors are in the Appendix. They
serve as a proxy for the structural transformation of the Brazilian economy. Here, the statistics
exhibit a substantial structural change. Sector 19 for instance, occupied second place in 2010,
dropping to eighth in 2013. Across the board, sector 14 delivers the highest results. Other
important sectors are resin manufacturing and elastomers (17) and various chemical products
and preparations (22). Taking the average and ranking the elements of Table 3, the five most
important sectors in the period are petroleum refining and coke (14), resin manufacturing and
elastomers (17), various chemical products and preparations (22), chemicals (16), and
pesticides (19).
     Pesticides (19), pulp and paper products (12), varnishes, paints and lacquers (21), non-
ferrous metallurgy (26), steel manufacturing and derivatives (25), automotive manufacturing
(31), and parts and accessories for motor vehicles (32) all showed deteriorated network power
to increase output of the economy. Food and beverages (6) and chemicals (16) are relatively
stable over the period. Notice the absence of traditional agriculture sectors in Table 3.
    Moreover, construction, a traditional sector, reveals limited capacity to pull the economy
out of the recession. Other sectors like automotive manufacturing (31) overall exhibited a
modest power to stimulate the economy, although its size is relevant. Information services
(39) and financial intermediaries (4) have little influence in triggering economic activity. For
details, see Table 6 in the Appendix.
     Nevertheless, the results should be interpreted around the benchmark year (2013) since
this is the lattest official statistic available to build the I-O matrix. Extensions of the results to
the current period should be interpreted with a grain of salt. In the absence of a profound
change in the Brazilian economic structure, then the sectors in Table 3 need to be stimulated.
    The results suggest therefore that traditional sectors have a limited power to foster
economic activity. The government's strategy should focus on sectors with large backward
linkages to rapidly overcome the recession. Simple policies of expanding credit supply and
giving tax cuts to the automotive manufacturing sector might not function this time. It seems
unlikely that the recovery will come from agriculture either.

6. Conclusion

This paper has applied the Dietzenbacher (1992)'s eigenvector method to rank sectors
according to their power to pull the Brazilian economy out of the recession. This innovative
method can shed light on the discussions about which sectors should be stimulated during the
crisis. We have built a recent 2013 I-O matrix to compute the backward linkage indicators.
     The results indicate that five activities are key to stimulate the economy: petroleum
refining and coke, resin manufacturing and elastomers, various chemical products and
preparations, non- ferrous metallurgy, and Chemicals. These results are crucial as a guide for
development policies. Traditional sectors do not exhibit high scores. In particular,
construction and automotive manufacturing show a poor and modest performance
respectively. It suggests that to overcome this recession requires other policies and incentives
for different sectors.
     The results thus show that governement policies must emphasize strategic sectors. Like
the ones displayed in Table 3. Taking extreme measures becomes vital to fight this recession.
The tradicional macro development models pay scant attention to mesoeconomics. In this
vein, the paper provides a mesoeconomic perspective to tackle Brazil's problems.
