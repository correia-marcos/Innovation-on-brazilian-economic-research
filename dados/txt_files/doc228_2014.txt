The empirical literature has produced strong evidence that, after controlling for pupils’ socioeconomic
characteristics, teacher quality is the most important school factor in explaining pupil’s performance in
standardized tests. However, there is no consensus on how public school systems could improve teacher
quality. Brazilian federal government introduced in 2009 a national minimum salary for public school
teachers that triggered an exogenous increase in municipal teacher’s salaries. The objectives of this paper
are twofold. The first objective is to investigate the compliance of municipal school system with the
national minimum teacher salary law. We find that unobserved factors are determinant in explaining
salary variability among municipalities and the compliance with the law. The second objective is to
assess the impact of salary on retention and recruitment of teachers by municipal school systems,
exploring the exogenous variation of municipal teacher salary and teacher longitudinal data. Using
difference-in-difference methods with selection on observables, we conclude that exogenous salary rise
do not move teachers in the first two years of the national teacher minimum salary policy.
Keywords: Impact evaluation; teachers’ minimum salary; teachers’ labor market.

Há, na literatura empírica, fortes evidências de que, após controlar as características socioeconômicas dos
alunos, a qualidade do professor é o fator mais importante a explicar a proficiência escolar. Entretanto,
não existe consenso em relação a como as redes e sistemas públicos de ensino podem promover a
qualidade de seus professores. Com a introdução pelo Governo Federal do piso nacional do magistério
público, houve elevação exógena dos salários dos professores do Ensino Fundamental da rede municipal.
Os objetivos deste artigo são: (i) investigar o cumprimento do piso salarial por parte dos municípios
brasileiros; (ii) estimar o impacto da elevação salarial sobre a retenção e o recrutamento de professores
por parte dos sistemas e redes de ensino municipais, explorando a variação exógena nos salários e um
painel de professores. Fatores não observados são determinantes para explicar a variabilidade dos salários
entre as redes municipais e também para explicar a propensão a cumprir a lei do piso salarial do
magistério. Usando o método de diferença em diferenças aliado a seleção em observáveis, concluímos
que a variação exógena dos salários dos professores não afetou o movimento dos professores entre redes
de ensino e não reduziu a evasão da profissão nos dois primeiros anos da política.

                                                      1 Introduction
        Teachers pay is the largest single budget item of any school system. In Brazilian municipalities,
for instance, about 60% of the education budget is spent with teachers’ payroll or is supposed to be,
considering Constitutional imposition5. Studies show that improving teacher quality could significantly
raise the performance of low-scoring students6 and after controlling for pupils’ socioeconomic
background, the most important school factor to explain pupils’ performance in standardized tests is
teacher quality7. Thus, an important policy issue is how countries can increase the quality of teachers.
        Studies also concluded that teacher quality is not explained by observable characteristics in terms
of experience and schooling, but mainly by unobservable characteristics8, making it even harder to
promote teacher quality, particularly in public schools since public school system salary schedules are
generally based on observables. A vast literature shows that higher relative teachers’ salaries increase the
likelihood that an individual enters into teacher profession and reduce the likelihood that a teacher leaves
the profession9. Imazeki (2005) found that teacher transfers between school systems respond most
strongly when district salaries are increased relative to nearby districts10.
        Intuitively, offering higher salaries and/or better work conditions is a necessary condition for
attracting high quality teachers. However, this condition is not sufficient since less motivated workers are
induced to apply for the vacancy by higher salaries too. Dal Bó et al (2013), using an experiment in
Mexico, find that higher wages attract more able applicants as measured by their IQ, personality, and
public service motivation. Thus, their results are against the hypothesis of adverse selection. Besides, they
find that distance and worse municipal characteristics strongly decrease acceptance rates, but higher
wages help bridge the recruitment gap in municipalities characterized by worse work conditions.
        Results from a large empirical literature indicate that salaries paid to teachers are negatively
related to their propensities to exit teaching profession and positively related to durations in first teaching
positions11. More related to our approach, Falch (2011) examines the effect of salaries on teacher leaving
decisions using a natural experiment. In Norway, teachers in schools with a lot of prior teacher vacancies
received a salary premium of about 10 percent during 1993-94 to 2002-03. Using a school fixed effects
model, he finds that the salary premium reduces the probability of voluntary quits by 6 p.p..
        There is a vast literature which investigates the effects of the minimum wage on labor market and
particularly on labor supply, and is beyond this article objectives review it. But, as far as we know, there
is not any study that analyzes and assesses the impact of salary variation on teacher retention, recruitment
or exits in the Brazilian context. A pre-requisite to properly address this question is a source of exogenous
variation in salaries. We explore the introduction of minimum salary for Brazil’s public school teacher as
an exogenous shock driving up teachers’ salaries in some municipalities. In Brazil, teacher salaries are
lower than in alternative occupations, and there is evidence that poor performing students are attracted to
the teaching profession (INEP, 2009 and 2010). But after the introduction of the teacher minimum salary
in 2008, there has been a noticeable increase in the real salary of municipal teachers. We show evidence
of an exogenous increase of teacher salaries due to the introduction of a mandatory teacher minimum
salary in 2009 by the Brazilian federal government, and estimate the impact of salary hikes on retention

   According to Controladoria-Geral da União (CGU), the Brazilian Federal Internal Control Agency, of 124 auditing done
(120 municipalities and 4 states), despite the imposition by the Brazilian Constitution, only 83 sub-national governments
observe this rule, about 2/3 of those scrutinized school systems, though.

students test scores variability, in a lesser degree than the variability in socioeconomic characteristics (15%), but in a higher
degree than the variability in school characteristics (5%).

and attraction of teachers by municipal school systems. Municipalities whose teachers’ salaries were
below the national minimum when the law was enacted experienced larger teachers’ salary increases than
the others between 2008 and 2011.
        Thus, the objectives of this article are twofold. First, we aim to investigate the compliance of
municipal school system with the national minimum teacher salary law. It is necessary to characterize
compliers and non-compliers and investigate the role of selection on observables in explaining
compliance with the law. After understanding compliance and characterizing treatment, as the second
objective of this work, we estimate the impact of an exogenous salary raise on attraction and retention of
teachers in Brazilian municipal school systems using teacher panel constructed with Brazilian School
Census. In order to verify whether municipalities are complying with the law and the magnitude of salary
variation due to the introduction of minimum salary regulation, we had to carry out a survey with
municipal department of education and get information about teacher career structure and base salaries
throughout the period since 2008.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some relevant institutional
features of Brazilian municipal school systems. Section 3 discusses the data used in this paper and
presents our survey methodology. The identification strategy is described in Section 4. Section 5 brings
the investigation about compliance with the law. The investigation whether salary hikes move teachers is
presented in Section 6 and, finally, Section 7 concludes.

                                            2 Institutional Background
        Brazil’s Constitution states the responsibilities of each government level in guaranteeing public
and free education for all their citizens. More broadly, the Brazilian public basic education system is
characterized by a decentralized nature and by a federal funding scheme. Each of these government actors
has its own public educational system and is responsible for its maintenance and for the administration of
its funds and financial resources.
        A federal funding scheme guarantees a minimum amount of resource per pupil in each municipal
and state school system. The Constitution reserves 25% of state and municipal taxes and 18% of federal
taxes for education. Most part of these resources makes up a fund, FUNDEB12, in each state of the
federation. Its resources distribution across public school systems is based on the quantity of pupils in
each system13. Accordingly to the Constitution, at least 60% of the FUNDEB resources have to be spent
with salaries of teachers and other professionals directly involved in teaching activity. Furthermore, each
municipality is supposed to have a Municipal Council for Social Monitoring and Control of FUNDEB, a
board composed of members of the government and the civil society which has as its main duty to
monitor and to control the distribution, transfer and use of resources from FUNDEB in the local context.
        Brazilian municipal school systems employ 1.07 million teachers, 471,266 teach in primary
school (62.4% of the total primary teachers) and 355,669 teach in lower secondary school (41.2% of the
total secondary teachers). Considering that the total amount of all FUNDEB funds transferred to
municipalities in 2012 summed R$ 64.88 billions, it is presumed that approximately R$ 38.93 bi were
paid to municipal school teachers and other school staff directly involved in teaching activities in 2012.
        The decentralized nature of Brazilian public basic education system gives great organizational
autonomy to sub-national governments in managing their educational systems. The maintenance of the
system, including the definition of teacher career and payment structures is decentralized. Therefore
municipal teachers’ salaries are decided by local governments. Until January 2009, the municipalities had
established the salary of teachers independently. After passing the Law No.11738, of July 16th, 2008, the
Federal Government began to set the minimum amount to be paid as base salary of teachers of all public

   Portuguese acronym for Basic Education Maintenance and Development Fund (Fundo de Manutenção e Desenvolvimento
da Educação Básica e de Valorização dos Profissionais da Educação). Roughly 20% of municipal and state taxes are allocated
to FUNDEB. Apart from FUNDEB, according to the Brazilian Constitution, municipalities also have to spend in education
25% of their own collected taxes in education, and 5% of the bunch of taxes associated to FUNDEB.
13
   Federal government supplements state FUNDEB when is necessary to guarantee the minimum national value of resources
per pupil. Since 2010, the total amount transferred by federal government to the 27 FUNDEB (one fund for each state and the
Federal District) corresponds to 10% of the total resources put in FUNDEB.
school systems14. In October 2008, soon after the minimum wage law was enacted, governors of five
states questioned the constitutionality of the law15. On April 6th, 2011, the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF)
decided for the constitutionality of the law. Since this decision became unappealable only on 14th April of
2014, perhaps public officials had not felt themselves obliged to comply with the law beforehand.
        According to the new law, every school system that were paying teachers a base salary of less
than R$ 950 per 40 hours of work per week16, or proportionally equivalent, must raise the salary on
January 2009 by at least 2/3 of the difference to the established minimum value. The transition to new
minimum base salary value should have been completed by January 2010, when the school systems must
pay at least the minimum salary as a base salary to their teachers, which was R$ 1,024.67 at the time.
According to decision of the Ministry of Education, supported by the STF, the teacher minimum salary is
yearly adjusted by the predicted rate of increase of the resources from FUNDEB per pupil.
        Public school system’s pay policy is based on salary formulae that reward teacher characteristics
such as possessing graduate degrees and master certificates, and, mainly, seniority. Despite its increasing
adoption among developed countries, performance-based pay is almost inexistent amongst municipal
school systems in Brazil17. Typically, teacher salary consists of two parts: (i) a base salary, established
accordingly to the teacher’s workload; and (ii) an additional part based on teacher’s seniority and number
of hours of graduate credits or graduate degrees teacher has. Generally these rewards are calculated as a
percentage of the base salary. Thus, if the education and experience of the average teacher in a school
system did not change from one year to the next, then average teacher pay would increase by the same
percentage as well. When school systems raise the pay of teachers, they normally increase all the cells of
these schedules by a fixed percentage.

                     3 Data and the Survey with Municipal Departments of Education
       In Brazil, except for the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS)18, there is no
comprehensive source of information about municipal teacher salary, and there is absolutely no
information about their beginning base salary. In order to determine whether municipal school systems
comply with the national minimum teacher salary we need a precise source of its teacher base salary. But
in RAIS we get the employee’s final remuneration, including some benefits and rewards for seniority, for
instance. Thus, to circumvent limitations of existing database, we carried out a survey with municipal
departments of education in partnership with the National Union of Municipal Secretaries of Education
(UNDIME19), to get precise information about teachers’ beginning salaries and career structures.
3.1) The Survey
       The survey questionnaire, which was inserted in a web platform and put into the UNDIME
website20, consisted of questions about teacher career and remuneration in every January of the period

   When introduced, the stipulated minimum base salary of R$ 950 was approximately equivalent to 2.04 minimum salaries in
2009. In 2013, national minimum salary of teachers corresponded to R$ 1,567, or 2.31 minimum salaries (R$ 678).
17
   Only 2.3%, or 22 municipalities, among 955 who answered this survey question, adopt a system of pay based on
performance.The state with more municipalities which has this kind of performance-based pay scheme is the state of Ceará,
with 5 municipalities, among 39 respondents (12.8%), followed by the state of São Paulo with 7 municipalities (out of 184
respondents). Only 7 of those 22 municipalities have adopted such a scheme of compensation during the period of analysis.
This extremely low number makes us confident in rejecting any influence of these schemes on any obtained results.

supported by contributions of its members, almost 5,000 municipal departments of Education. Its mission is to coordinate,
mobilize and integrate the municipal secretaries of education to improve public education. It organizes and promotes research,
meetings, seminars and forums and, in addition, maintains contacts with unions, non-governmental organizations, social
movements, and other entities of the civil society.

   UNDIME often carries out quick surveys about education issues and sometimes carries out broader surveys like ours. When
asked to answer the questionnaire, the members of the municipal departments of Education were told that their identity and
their municipality identity would not be disclosure and all the information would be displayed through averages or by group of
municipalities. Furthermore, no information would be passed on to third parties. Therefore, because respondents were
2008-201321. The survey worked as follows. UNDIME sent electronic messages to its mailing list,
composed of about 5,000 municipal departments of education and their heads. This message contains a
presentation of the research project, an invitation for participation and a link to access the questionnaire in
UNDIME website. Representatives of each municipal department of education, after registering into the
survey web system, informing their name, position and telephone number and e-mail contacts, filled the
survey questionnaire. UNDIME conditioned the partnership to confidentiality agreement. Municipal
department of education was told that their identity would not be unveiled to third parties. Therefore we
are not allowed to publicly identify municipalities or its representative in the database.
        The first phase of the field research took place between May 17th and July 31st, 2013, and
consisted of a pre-test. From UNDIME mailing contacts information, we constructed a stratified
representative sample of 399 municipalities to participate in the pre-test, whose purpose was, first, to test
the collection instrument and indicate further necessary improvements, and, second, to inform us the rate
of participation through each sample stratum, taken in consideration to define the final representative
sample. The second phase of the research has taken place from September 2013 until February 28th 2014.
        Even though UNDIME has sent messages to all its contacts and wanted that all its members take
part in the survey, we decided to stimulate the participation of municipalities included in a nationwide
representative sample of municipal school systems. Based on the experience of the pre-test we have
learned that we should check whether municipal departments of education had received the messages
from UNDIME and, more importantly, we should encourage them into answering the web survey through
telephone calls. Thus, to reduce the costs and the time spent in collecting data and to guarantee
representativeness of the respondents, we focus on the participation of a nationwide representative
sample. In order to guarantee that municipal school systems included in this sample actually had received
the the link to the web questionnaire, we tried to contact all of them and also tried subsequent contacts to
reassure them the importance of completing the questionnaire until the end of the survey deadline.
        In our survey with all municipal departments of education, 1,600 of them entered the
questionnaire web system and answered at least one question and 1,111 reached the end of the
questionnaire. However, only 905 school systems have informed beginning teacher base salaries of their
primary schools observed at least in January 2008 and January 2009 or January 2010, necessary values
for assessing salary variation in the period 2008-2010, which is the focus of our analysis.
        It is important to clarify that making contact with municipalities from the Northeast region and,
mainly, North region was much more difficult than making contact with municipalities of other regions.
Facing the challenge of trying to contact municipal departments of education from Northern parts of
Brazil, we asked several regional bureaus of UNDIME to help us in this task. After that we noticed that
participation rate raised in some states but not in others, where UNDIME’s mobilizing capacity seems
weaker, such as AP, AM, PA, RR, MA, PE, AL and SE. The participation rate of out of the sample
municipal department of education can be seen as a proxy of regional bureaus mobilizing capacity22.
Another factor that helps to explain such timid participation among Northern and Northeastern municipal
departments of education is their still restricted internet access and their poorer institutions.23
        Table 1 shows participation rate amongst Brazilian states, considering the representative sample
and out of the sample participants. From the representative sample we got 40.2% of participants. On the
other hand, only 8% of the municipalities out of the sample informed their teacher salaries. The huge gap



answering to their own peers, we believe that the survey brings us accurate information. Even though, we intend to do some
consistency checks with other databases.

   Except for regional bureaus of Acre and Rondônia because all of the municipalities of those states have taken part in the
sample.
23
   Some anecdotal evidence can be mentioned. Members of some municipal departments of education from Northeast Region
have told us that members of the former administration destroyed administrative records about teacher pay, and others, from
North, have told us they are having problems with internet access. From one municipal department we have heard that the
mayor has suffered an impeachment and all city head departments were dismissed. Few weeks later in a second contact, the
situation was still confused and the person we had the mobile-phone number, the only telephone number we had from that
department of education, was not working at the department of education anymore.
between those participation rates highlights the importance of our work of contacting municipal
departments of education and stimulating their participation in the survey.

        There are large differences in participation rate amongst Brazilian states and regions.
Municipalities from South, Southeast and Mid-West reached higher participation rate, of about 55% of
the representative sample against participation rate of 34.6% and 27.5% of Northern and Northeastern
municipalities, respectively. Consequently, to restore sample representativeness, we had to calculate
sample weights and consider them in order to properly analyze the data.
        In addition to our survey information, we gathered teacher longitudinal data obtained from School
Census between 2007 and 2010. The Census, which is carried out by the INEP yearly, identifies teachers
since 2007. It provides among a bunch of information, teachers characteristics such as gender, skin color,
whether they are graduated, the year of college graduation, whether they have post graduation diplomas,
and schools, grades and classes they teach. Thus we managed to link each year Census and built a teacher
panel from 2007 to 2010. Therefore we use the panel to investigate teachers move in and out school
systems, identifying their transition between school systems and drop outs. In order to investigate the
effect of exogenous salary hikes on teachers move, we calculated yearly proportions of new teachers,
teachers who stayed in, teachers who changed employer and teachers who drop out the profession for
each municipal school system.
3.2) Sample methodology
        Sample size was calculated assuming the following: (i) a standard deviation for the average Prova
Brasil pupils’ achievement test scores per municipality of about 55 points; (ii) a statistical power of 80%;
(iii) a statistical significance level of 5%; (iv) an expected participation rate of 60% (which was adjusted
to 50% after the pre-test); (v) that the intention of detecting differences of at least 10 points on the
average Prova Brasil pupil’s achievement test scores per municipality when statistically comparing the
group of municipalities that complied with the minimum salary policy in 2009 (group 1) with those which
did not complied (group 2)24; (vi) the selection of municipalities considering stratified simple random
sample; and (vii) a design effect of 1.
         An initial estimated survey sample size was then calculated as 1130 municipalities, with 565
municipalities from each of the considered groups. The sample size for the pre-test was defined as 30% of
the sample size estimated for the survey. Note that, after the realization of the pre-test, the survey sample
size was inflated to 1212 municipalities, considering the observed participation rate of 50%.
         After the sample size estimation, a stratified simple random sample was selected. Municipalities
were stratified by states, inclusion or not in the CONVIVA frame25, and by size with capitals and
municipalities with 100 thousand or more inhabitants, according to the 2010 Brazilian census, being
classified in a ‘large municipality’ stratum and the remaining ones in a ‘small and medium municipality’
stratum. An exception was made for the state of São Paulo, where the criteria for a municipality to be
classified in the ‘large municipality’ stratum has been having 200 thousands inhabitants or more.
         Sample allocation of municipalities among the strata was aimed to be made uniformly among
strata and disproportionally in the strata defined by the inclusion or not in the CONVIVA frame,
considering a larger probability of selection for those municipalities listed in the CONVIVA frame.
Moreover, municipalities classified in the ‘large municipality’ stratum were selected with certainty
(probability of one). Such sample size adjustments guided by the sample allocation over the strata in
addition to round procedures (to the next larger integer) in the sample size for each strata led to a final
sample size of 1441 municipalities.
         After survey data collection procedures were concluded, sample survey weights were calculated,
for each municipality, accounting for unequal selection probabilities and adjust for unit non response.
Therefore, the use of the calculated weights in data analysis procedures compensate for different selection
probabilities and non response and guarantees the property that weighted sample moments are consistent
for population moments with respect to the joint sampling/non response probability distribution. Non
response adjustment procedures adopted in this article assume a missing at random mechanism.
3.3) Descriptive Statistics
        Our weighted representative sample represents well the entire population of Brazilian
municipalities. Descriptive statistics that compare the weighted sample and the whole population of
municipalities in respect to some socioeconomic characteristics, their school system budget, their school
infrastructure and pupils’ family socioeconomic background are available from the authors upon request.
Our sample data recovers almost identical distribution of municipalities through Brazilian Regions and, in
terms of municipal socioeconomic characteristics, averages are quite similar between our sample and the
population, but adult illiteracy rate. Also average municipal school facilities are similar between our
weighted sample and the population municipal school systems. There are statistically significant
differences between our sample and the population only in part of the socioeconomic background
variables. In sum, although our weighted sample slightly overestimates population socioeconomic status
in some dimensions, we argue those differences are relatively small and do not taint the representation of
the population of Brazilian municipalities.

   This sample was originally designed to our other article whose objective is to assess the impact of teacher salary raise on
pupils’ proficiency.

   CONVIVA is a web platform, administered by UNDIME with partnership of several Brazilian NGOs, whose main objective
is to deliver, totally free of charges, information and management tools to Municipal Departments of Education in order to
improve local education policies. As the members of Municipal Departments of Education need to inform valid email
addresses to participate in the CONVIVA framework, we think that the probability of having our email messages been red, and
consequently of receiving the questionnaires back would be higher than in the cases of municipalities that have not signed in
CONVIVA’s platform. Besides, the involvement in CONVIVA would be a proxy for quality of the department of education.

        According to our survey, the majority of Brazilian municipal school systems were impinged by
the introduction of the national minimum salary26. Salaries are higher in the southern regions of Brazil,
where less than half of its municipalities (46.1%) have been impinged by the national minimum teacher
salary. Meanwhile, in the northern and mid-western regions 78.3% of its municipalities have been
impinged by the law27. Figure 1a shows the histogram of the lowest value of each municipal school
system base salary of beginning teachers in January 200828. We see that the defined minimum salary
(marked by the traced red line) was almost the national average considering the municipalities which
informed us their teacher salaries29. Figure 1b presents the histogram of municipal average teacher
beginning base salaries in January 2008. The histograms show that there is a relatively high dispersion in
Brazilian municipal base salary distribution.

   We find that actually 61.2% of the Brazilian municipal school systems had any teacher base salary smaller than R$950 in
2008, and consequently were impinged by the law introduction. In 2011, the percentage of municipal school systems which
were paying less than the legal minimum as a base salary fell 26.8 p.p., to 34.4% of Brazilian municipalities. Even though
there was a sharp reduction in the proportion of municipalities with minimum salaries below the national minimum, it is still a
high proportion of non-compliance with the law. In 2013, 32.9% of Brazilian municipalities remain on the margin of the law.
Here we had to assume that base salaries remained constant between January and June of 2008, when the law was enacted or,
if it had been raised, the lowest municipal base salary in June would be still below the established national minimum.
27
   Tables with detailed proportions are available from the authors upon request.
28
   Often the lowest base salary in each municipal school system is the one of the beginning teacher without college degree.
29
   Sample weights matter. The average of the municipal minimum base salary obtained applying sample weights (R$ 936.01 in
2008) is statistically different from the simple average (R$ 967.32 in 2008) at 5% level of significance.
        The institution of the minimum salary moved partially municipal teacher’s salaries as shown by
Figure 2. Looking at the distribution density of municipal lowest teacher base salary in the period from
2008 to 2011, we can see a decrease in the mass of municipalities that pay less than the national
minimum salary as base salary and, at the same time, an increase in the mass of school systems which
paid exactly or nearly around the stipulated minimum from 2009 (dashed red line) to 2010 (orange line)
or to 2011 (red line). From 2008 to 2009, Brazilian municipalities raised teacher base salaries on average
by 12.9% of variation, what represented a considerable gain in real terms for teachers since Brazilian
economy has witnessed an annual inflation rate of 5.9% that year.
        Our data reveals that municipal school systems which comply with the law raised salaries sharper
than non-impinged ones and non-compliers. As shown in Table 2, compliers raised salaries 16.2 p.p.
(113.84 Brazilian Reais) more than the others and 15.0 p.p. (130.31 Brazilian Reais) more than non-
compliers. And it is important to mention that we could not reject the null hypothesis that the difference
between salary variation of non-impinged and of non-compliers is zero.

        Enlarging the period of analysis do 2011 reveals the same pattern of comparison between
compliers with the law and the others municipal school systems. Between 2008 and 2011 the distribution
of teacher salary variation of school systems that do not comply with the national minimum salary has its
mode and mean near nominal GDP growth rate (24.9%), considerably smaller than the minimum salary
increase in the same period (41.7%), which is a little bit smaller than the mode and the mean of the
distribution of the teacher salary variation of municipal school systems that comply with the law at least
during one school year in the period (see Figure 3).

                   Note: Others here represents all other municipal school systems of our base.
        Impinged municipalities, split into non-compliers and compliers, are less populated, poorer, have
greater illiteracy rates and receive fewer resources from FUNDEB30. Differences between compliers and
non-compliers are milder than differences between each one of these groups and not impinged school
systems. Municipalities of school systems that complied with the law (Treatment Group) are different
from municipalities of those school systems that did not comply with the minimum teacher salary in
terms of per capita GDP, illiteracy rate and whether they have an own retirement system for public
servants. Also they are more concentrated in the Northeast Region. On the other hand, non-compliers are
more frequent in the South and Mid-West than compliers. However, in terms of school system
characteristics, those groups are similar. As expected because compliers are more concentrated in the
Northeast, the only significant difference against non-compliers are the higher proportions of school
systems that receive resources complementation from federal government and of pupils who study in
rural schools. Perhaps surprisingly, school infrastructure is poorer among compliers than in non-
compliers, considering some of the informed facilities, and pupils come from a more deprived
background. Furthermore, after controlling for states where municipalities are situated, mayors’ political
party affiliation revealed no significant correlation to compliance with the law31.
        On the other hand, impinged and non-impinged school systems and their municipalities are
different in almost every aspect. Thus, to avoid bias when estimating the impact of teacher salary hikes,
the utilization of non-impinged municipalities in the construction of a comparison group would require
the adoption of a selection on observables method.
        As part of our survey, school systems informed about the occurrence of teachers strike during the
period between 2009 and 2013. Strikes occurred in 16.1% of the municipalities, and were more frequent
in non-compliers (22.0%) than in municipalities whose school system complied with the law (18.2%),
however this difference is not statistically significant. On the other hand, municipalities classified as non-
impinged suffered less with strikes than both these former groups (12.5%), a difference statistically
significant.
        Based on the descriptive statistics presented, we can infer that the institution of the minimum
salary contributed for an increase in real terms of local teachers’ salaries, mainly among impinged
municipalities and more profoundly among compliers. Despite this, a significant part of municipalities
did not comply with the national teachers’ minimum salary, probably due to the absence of disciplinary
punishment under the law, the discussion about the constitutionality of the law and the existence of severe
budget constraints in some local governments.
        There are several ways to characterize treatment and determine whether each school system
underwent treatment or not. Unfortunately we could not get salary of each teacher therefore we have to
work with the average teacher beginning salary of each municipal school system. As noted before, there
is a large range of teacher workloads among Brazilian school systems. Another limitation of the School
Census database is that there is no information about teachers’ contracts relatively their workload. Thus,
in order to construct the average teacher salary, we suppose that each workload, whether more than one
existed in a certain school system, represents the same proportion of teachers. We make the simple
average of all workloads of teachers distinguishing those with college degree from those without college
degree, and, after that, to obtain the school system average salary we calculate the mean weighted by the
proportion of teachers with and without college degree, according to the School Census. We argue that
this hypothesis does not interfere in the analysis because the salary differences between different
workloads are very small whether exist. Teacher salary heterogeneity within school systems is mostly due
to college and post-graduation degrees and tenure.

   They receive fewer resources from FUNDEB because they tend to be located in poorer states which collect lesser amounts of
taxes and contributions. On average, impinged municipalities spent in 2008 a larger proportion of municipal budget in
education (29.7% against 27.6%, statistically significant at 1% level), probably because they are poorer and consequently have
smaller budget revenues and receive lesser resources from FUNDEB. Actually, our data showed a strong negative correlation
between municipal per capita GDP and the proportion of municipal budget spent in education.

   In the sample there are 23 different political parties, some with a very small number of affiliated mayors. We need to
aggregate those parties somehow. We intend to test for measures of party ideological spectrum in a next version.

Notes: (1) Others here represents municipal school systems that were not impinged by the law enactment in 2008, but become impinged after national minimum salary adjustment in subsequent years and eventually becomes non-compliers; (2) Subtotal
represents the aggregation of non-compliers, non-impinged and others. Every estimates consider complex sample design.
        In characterizing treatment we look at each teacher sub-career (with and without college degree)
of each school system and consider as treated units the school systems where at least one of the sub-
careers had its salary raised supposedly because of the minimum salary introduction.
        As already explained, minimum teacher salary has been adjusted every year since its introduction.
Therefore, it is possible, what is actually common, that one school system comply with the law one
certain year and in the subsequent, after the minimum salary has been adjusted, the same municipality do
not comply with the law. For instance, of the compliers in 2009, about one quarter do not comply with the
minimum salary in 2010, and of compliers in 2010, almost 30% do not comply in 2011. Therefore the law
is not binding and compliance is not perennial either.
        Table 3 summarize the average teacher beginning base salary in Brazilian municipal school
systems in 2008 and 2011 as well as the average salary variation and the average amount of increase of
teacher base salary in the period according to school system status based on been impinged by the law
enactment and compliance with the law. Interestingly, the average salary variation rate and the average
amount of salary increase among compliers, independently of how many years municipal school systems
comply with the law in the period between 2008 and 2011, are very similar among the groups of
compliers. Considering this similar pattern of salary increase among compliers, our treatment group is
formed by all compliers when assessing the impact of salaries on teachers move in 2011, and just
compliers in 2009 and/or 2010 when assessing the impact on teachers move in 2010. Comparison groups
are formed by all other units. We decided to leave the role of selecting controls to our selection on
observables model.
3.4) Tests on the confidence of our survey
         According to PNAD 2011, the average total salary of teachers without college degree employed by
Brazilian municipal school systems was R$1,393.77 for a workload of 40h/week. Meanwhile, the average
total salary for those who have a college degree was R$2,211.21. Taking the aggregate, we see that 2011
total salaries were on average R$2,171.41. In fact, according to PNAD, the average teacher total salary
raised 59.3% between 2008 and 2011, 6.2 p.p. higher than the raise of teacher salary in the private sector.
These figures show that our survey perhaps underestimates teacher salary variation. Our survey estimate
(46.3%) indicates a 13 p.p. lesser salary variation than the self-reported salaries in PNAD (see Table 3).
One possibility that we need to investigate is that total salaries grew faster than base salary. We plan to do
that in the next version of the paper, using RAIS and SIOPE data.
         An alternative explanation is that the weights used in PNAD are not adequate to accurately recover
teacher salaries and, then, introduce bias in the estimates with different directions in different versions of
the household survey. PNAD estimates for teacher salary variation in the period vary strongly across
states, from -6.5%, in Amazonas, to 128.2%, in Roraima. Meanwhile the estimates recovered by our
survey reveal a milder variation across states, from 26,1%, in São Paulo, to 92,6%, in Pernambuco. It is
particularly odd that the average salary variation of municipal teachers in the state of São Paulo reaches
106.4% in PNAD, about 80 p.p. higher than ours. One last possible explanation to this divergence is that
respondents in PNAD do inform wrong workloads or consider effective workload inside class instead of
real workloads, i.e. defined in labor contracts. We know that there had been occurring changes in
teachers’ workloads since 2008. In the next version of the paper we will present an analysis on those
workload changes and intend to better understand the inconsistencies between our data and PNAD.

4) Methodology
        Unfortunately we do not have information about each teacher salary. Then we could not link
salary to teachers’ decision of staying in the job and in the profession. Therefore we had to work with
municipal beginning base salaries and had to focus on aggregate movements at the level of municipal
school system. With the available information we were able to investigate if school systems which
experienced higher teacher salary increases have suffered less with teachers exit and if these school
systems have attracted new teachers or teachers from the private sector.
        It is difficult to disentangle the impact of the salary hike from effects of other kind of policy. A
simple estimator based on the difference in means between treated and untreated groups would be tainted.
The salary of teachers should be endogenous with respect to other policies of the school system and
decided simultaneously with other policies. Besides, salary definition happens simultaneously with
individuals’ decision concerning teacher profession. Hence, in order to deal with the problems associated
with endogeneity and simultaneity, the identification of an exogenous source of variation in teacher
salaries is required to identify a causal relation. We explore the introduction of the national minimum
teacher salary, by federal law, as exogenous variation in teacher’s pay.
        In the present context, as the introduction of the minimum teacher salary was decided at the
federal level and municipal leaders largely did not participate in the decision process, we argue that the
salary hikes induced by the minimum salary introduction work as an exogenous source of salary
variation. Thus it is possible to exploit this fact to identify the effect of teacher pay on teachers’ decision
about leaving job or the profession and entries. Besides it can be investigate if higher salaries attract
teachers from other school systems, particularly from private sector (Menezes-Filho and Pazello, 2007).
        However, as shown in the previous section, due to institutional characteristics of Brazilian school
systems and the absence of explicit penalties for disobeying the minimum salary imposition or the
existence of judicial appeals against the law, the assignment to treatment is not deterministic. Ultimately,
to observe the law is a decision of the local administrators. Thus, not all municipal school system
assigned to treatment underwent it. In other words, once assigned to treatment, municipalities self-select
themselves to the treatment.
        Such a decision can be greatly influenced by observable and unobservable characteristics of the
municipality and its school system. Considering what Brazilian Constitution determines, municipal
teachers’ salaries should be explained by municipal revenues; transfers received from FUNDEB, which
are based on the number of enrollees in each municipal school system; and the number of teachers
employed by the school system. On the other hand, salaries can also be explained by numerous other
observed characteristics and even ones that are unobservable by the analyst, as the relative importance
given to education by the current ruler of the municipality, or even by his/her predecessors, and the
influence and bargaining power of local teachers' unions, just to mention two examples. The important
role played by unobserved and unobservable variables in explaining salary differences and treatment
status give us support in applying Difference-in-Differences (DID) methods in the estimation of the
impacts of salary raises on pupils’ performance.
        Furthermore, to reduce self-selection bias we rely also on a selection on observables method. The
use of an estimated propensity score helps in limiting bias associated to observed characteristics that are
correlated to the treatment and to the potential outcome of interest at the same time. According to DuGoff
et al (2014), more than just essential for addressing confounding in observational studies, only propensity
score methods combined with survey weights may lead to results generalizable to the survey target
population when we have complex sample design. Not incorporating the survey weights would
compromises external validity, such that outcomes would not be generalized to national figure. That
paper clarifies the appropriate inferences for different propensity score methods and suggests guidelines
for selecting an appropriate propensity score method based on a researcher's goal. Aiming to obtain
consistent estimates, after estimating the propensity score using the nearest neighbor method32, we
calculate the ATT weights, according to Abadie (2005).
        We follow the recommendation of DuGoff et al (2014) and include the survey weight as a
predictor in the probit model chosen for propensity score estimation. As put by the authors, the survey
weight may capture relevant factors, and perhaps variables related to the units probability of responding
to the survey and to undergo treatment. Furthermore, we agree that the propensity score model does not
need to be survey-weighted, as we are not interested in generalizing the propensity score model to the
population. However, in the outcome model we need to incorporate survey weights as we aim to estimate

32
   Alternatively we use kernel matching as a robustness check. Results remained qualitatively the same. Asymptotically, all
different matching techniques produce the same estimate because in large samples they all compare only the exact matches.
However, in finite samples, they differ because of the way they construct counterfactual and choose the weights. There is a
trade-off between the bias and variance of matching estimators. The nearest-neighbor matching minimizes the bias, as it
chooses only the closest comparison group observation and assigns all the weight to it in constructing the counterfactual. In
contrast, kernel matching assigns positive weights to several control units, what implies a greater bias. At the same time, kernel
matching reduces the variance of the estimate.
Population Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (PATT). The propensity score weights and survey
weights are multiplied to form a new weight for the outcome regression. In that way, incorporating the
complex survey, we estimate the effect of increasing teacher salary on the entire treated population.
       The potential outcomes are determined by a set of covariates in addition to the treatment as in the
following model:

     =   +        +      { = 2011} +           { = 2011} ∙       +    ′
                                                                           +

where the dependent variable, , is a proportion of teachers of the municipal school system in year is
explained by a constant ( ); the treatment group fixed effect captured by the coefficient of an indicator
variable which assumes value 1 if the municipal school system were treated and 0 otherwise, ; the
common effect of the passage of time, represented by ; the parameter of interest, γ, representing the
impact of the treatment, the abnormal teacher salary hike, on the dependent variable; and a vector of
covariates X that helps to explain the dependent variable. The model becomes complete with the error
term, ε . The aforementioned municipal school systems teachers’ proportions we analyze are: (i) the
proportion of teachers who stayed in the job of previous year; (ii) the proportion of teachers who exit the
job of previous year; (iii) the proportion of teachers who entered into the profession; (iv) the proportion of
teachers who were recruited in the year of reference; (v) the proportion of teachers who exit private
school and entered municipal school system; and (vi) the proportion of teachers who have college degree.
        In the OLS regression we weighted each observation using the following weights:
weight = iptw ∙ sample_weight
                          *+,-. /0
                                 21
where: iptw = d + )           21
                                      3 and p54 is the estimated propensity score of being treated.
                            +,0
       The key identifying assumption is that γ would be zero in the absence of treatment after matching
on the propensity score (E7ε | {t = 1} ∙ d , p : = 0).
       We get OLS estimates for the constant term, , corresponding to the average performance of the
comparison group at baseline; for , representing time invariant differences between treatment and
comparison groups; for , summarizing the way both groups are influenced by time; for , the average
treatment effect (parameter of interest); and for ′ , the parameter vector associated with changes in
covariates.

5) Explaining differences in teacher salary and in compliance with the law
        How are differences in teacher base salary amongst Brazilian municipal school systems and
characteristics of municipalities and municipal school systems related? We test a wide spectrum of
covariates. The region and, more specifically, the state where the municipal school system is located is
the most important explanatory variable33 for teacher beginning base salary differences in 2008, before
the introduction of the national minimum teacher salary, and respond to 33.1% of the salary variability.
Socioeconomic characteristics of the municipality, such as its population, per capita GDP, average
individual income, and adult illiteracy rate are also important and explain a bit more than 15.7% of the
variability. Those variables, when are put together, explain about 35.4% of the variability in municipal
teacher beginning base salary in 2008.
        After including school system characteristics, such as the proportion of budget allocated to
education, its school infrastructure and facilities, and teachers characteristics, the explained part of the
variability in teacher salaries amongst municipal school systems in 2008 increase only to 41.1%. Finally,
when pupils’ socioeconomic characteristics are included, more 5 percentage points (p.p.) of the variability
are explained. Thus, observable characteristics are responsible for about 46.2% of the variability in the
level of teacher beginning base salary amongst municipal school systems.


33
  Here we refer to explanatory variable in statistics and econometrics sense. In Econometrics, we call explanatory variable(s)
the variable(s) that is(are) in the right side of a certain equation model. When we say that a variable explain part of the
variation or variability of another variable (dependent variable in the model) we mean that the former variable accounts for the
variation (dispersion) of a given data set. We are not inferring any causal relation here.
         Do those determinants change after the introduction of an exogenous source of salary variation,
i.e., after the introduction of the national minimum teacher salary? And do the same determinants explain
selection to treatment? When we substitute salaries of 2008 for salaries of 2011 in the OLS regressions,
we see a decrease in the proportion of salary variability explained by observables. The variability verified
in teacher beginning base salary that is explained by the state where the school system is located reduces
year by year since the introduction of the national minimum salary. It falls from 33.1% in 2008 to 26.5%
in 2011. Moreover, the contribution of socioeconomic characteristics of municipalities to the variability in
salaries falls from 15.7% to 7.6% in 2011, and those two groups of covariates now explain just 28% of
the variability amongst Brazilian municipal school systems, 7.4 p.p. less than in 2008. All the observable
covariates now explain just 37.4% of the variability in salaries. Therefore the role of unobserved
characteristics grew about 9 p.p. in 3 years, from 53.8% in 2008 to 62.6% of the variability in 2011.
         Considering a linear probability model, all covariates, including tax revenues variation in the
period and the political party of the mayor, explain 34.7% of the treatment status or the probability of
being treated or complying with the law. Therefore, unobservable/unobserved variables have an even
more crucial role in selecting units into treatment than in explaining salary differences amongst Brazilian
municipal school systems.
         Trying to unveil at least part of the contribution of unobserved variables in explaining selection
into treatment, we further add personal characteristics of Municipal Department of Education heads as
explaining covariates. The source of those characteristics is another survey carried out by INEP with the
partnership of UNDIME and UNESCO in 2010, Perfil dos Dirigentes Municipais de Educação. When we
merge our database with that other base, part of the original sample vanished, reducing the number of
municipalities to less than 400. The explained part of the linear probability with this restricted sample
raises to 50.3% without characteristics of the head of the municipal departments and to 53.5% after
introducing those characteristics into the model. Thus some personal characteristics of the head of the
Municipal Department of Education, such as gender, schooling, remuneration, being a politician (whether
from a political party that supports the mayor or from an opposition party), being a former school
principal, being from any docent career (whether of the same municipality, other municipality, the state
system or private school) and being or not a full-time head of department, increase the explained part of
the treatment status among municipal school systems by only a little more than 3 p.p..
         The important role played by unobserved and unobservable variables in explaining salary
differences and compliance with the national minimum salary gives us support in applying Difference-in-
Differences methods in the estimation of the impacts of salary raises on teachers move.

6) Estimating the effects of salary on teacher retention
        The ultimate objective of the imposition of a national teacher minimum salary was to enhance the
quality of the basic education provided by Brazilian public sector. The immediate purpose of the policy
was to attract and avoid drop outs of higher ability teachers.
        Tables 4 and 5 show that the estimates obtained with DID regressions are not statistically different
from zero, considering a statistical significance of 5%, for every teacher proportion we examined. Just for
the proportion of teachers who come from private schools raising salaries seems to have a positive effect
at 10% of significance, but the result is not robust to other specifications of the selection on observables.
Therefore, apparently, salary hikes were not enough to change teachers’ exits and transfers to municipal
school systems.

7) Concluding remarks
        Brazilian federal government introduced a national minimum teacher base salary to be observed in
every public school system from January 2009. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the
policy and its effects. The first objective of this work was to investigate the compliance of municipal
school system with the national minimum teacher salary and the effects of the law on teacher salary. We
carried out a survey based on a representative sample of municipal department of education to get precise
teacher base salaries of each municipal school system. The estimates obtained through our survey reveals
that the institution of the minimum salary moved teacher salaries of just part of the municipalities
impinged by the law.
        Our survey reveals that there are a high proportion of municipalities that do not comply with the
law, a proportion similar to the proportion of municipalities that, according to CGU, do not observe the
obligation of spending at least 60% of FUNDEB with teacher pay. According to our estimates, the role of
observable characteristics in explaining the compliance with the law is very limited, even when we
incorporate some characteristics of the head of the municipal department of education, what leaves
considerable place for unobserved characteristics in explaining teacher salaries and the compliance with
the law. Therefore, any attempt to assess the impacts of the exogenous salary variation brought by the
introduction of the minimum salary, should rely on any method that control for unobservables.
        Some inconsistencies found between our estimates and estimates obtained with PNAD should be
carefully investigated. We have to analyze the consistency of our data on teacher base salary considering
information available in RAIS and SIOPE, what we will do next.
        The main objective of the policy seems to be to enhance teacher quality in public schools through
better remuneration. Since the first year of the policy, municipal school systems which complied with the
law raised salaries sharper than non-impinged ones and non-compliers. Thus we tried to answer if
compliers perform better than non-compliers and non-impinged municipal school systems in retaining
and attracting teachers. However estimates based on DID and selection on observables show null effects
of the policy on teachers move in the first two years, 2009 and 2010. As a next step, we will extend our
analysis to 2011 and 2012 and we will enhance our identification considering salary increases relative to
nearby municipalities.
