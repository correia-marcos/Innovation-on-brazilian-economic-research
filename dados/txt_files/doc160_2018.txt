ABSTRACT: A new methodology is proposed to analyze the strategic decision about
firms’ location choice faced with the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. For this, we combine
Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) and Agent Based Simulation (ABS) approaches with
input-output analysis. A study of case is presented to empirically evaluate our model.
Firms are competing in two different sectors: (a) crop and animal production, hunting
and related service activities; (b) financial service activities, except insurance and pension
funding. We desegregate the European Union in manifold regions. To decide where to
locate, firms consider the following exogenous factors: (i) potential market; (ii) local
productive interdependence; (iii) labor costs and (iv) displacement cost. To generate the
results, we create hypothetical scenarios, in which firms can assign specific weights to
each of these factors. The results suggest that in traditional sectors firms tend to seek
unsaturated markets. Otherwise, in sectors related to services, the greater the uncertainty,
the greater the likelihood that firms will move.

RESUMO: Propõe-se uma nova metodologia para analisar a decisão de localização
das firmas em ambiente de incerteza diante do Brexit. Uma abordagem de Jogos Evolu-
cionários e Simulação por Agente em conjunto com a análise de insumo-produto foi
utilizada. Para avaliar empiricamente nosso modelo, consideramos que as firmas competem
em dois setores diferentes: (a) produção agrícola e animal, caça e atividades de serviços
relacionados; (b) atividades de serviços financeiros, exceto seguros e fundos de pensão.
Ao desagregar a União Europeia em países, a escolha de localização das firmas considera
os fatores exógenos: (i) mercado potencial; (ii) interdependência produtiva local; (iii)
custos de mão de obra e (iv) custo de deslocamento, os quais assumem pesos distintos.
Os resultados sugerem que nos setores tradicionais, as firmas tendem a buscar mercados
não saturados. Nos setores relacionados a serviços, quanto maior a incerteza, maior a
probabilidade das firmas se relocalizarem.

1 Introduction
       Firm’s strategic location decision is discussed in many fields of Economic literature.
From the Regional Economics perspective, the location decision is based on the balance
between a complex relation of attraction and repulsion of consumers and firms (1, 2).
In this way, the economic activity to be developed in a given region can be determined
by minimizing costs 1 or by maximizing market potential 2 . Recently, through the New
Economic Geography approach, firms’ location decision has been handled jointly by these
two perspectives, as can be seen in 12, 13.
       By it turns, the Industrial Organization (IO) framework is mostly concerned with
the theoretical understanding of the competition nature in markets when firms strategically
decide where to locate. According to 14, 15, by introducing interregional labor mobility
as one of the central aspects in locational decision, it is possible to establish a dialogue
between the regional economy, industrial organization, international trade and theories of
growth and economic development.
       According to 16, despite the vast literature3 that has been established about location
decision in these fields of study, there are few studies about spatial competition4 lying on
the interface of evolutionary game theory (EGT), Agent Based Simulation (ABS) models
and regional science, since the EGT and ABS models have been applied mainly in IO
researches. Although it may still be in its infancy, this theme should attract more interest
from regional analysis, because the competitive locational problem emerges as a prototype
of many economic situations involving dynamically interacting decisions in which firms
can learn with their own choices over time.
       A fact that illustrates the circumstances presented above is the issue involving
Brexit. As presented in 23, the possible withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from
the European Union (EU) may generate an environment of uncertainty and economic
instability. To be more precise, Brexit may imply uncertainties about firms’ locational
decision. 24 argue that the end of common markets could harm the customs union and
reduce competition and the scale of production. Another possible consequence is an increase
in legal and economic insecurity.
       In this way, the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union may imply in a
reconsideration of the optimal location by firms according to productivity differentials,
factor prices (25), regional characteristics, size of internal markets and regulatory issues
(26). Thus, under such conditions, EGT and ABS models may bring some insight into
the behavioral pattern of firms’ location decision. While the traditional theory of games
requires that players have a very high level of rationality, the EGT model has been used to
successfully explain a number of aspects of agents’ behavior. More specifically, EGT and
ABS may accomplish better success in describing and predicting the choices of locational
decisions, since it is better equipped to handle the weaker rationality assumptions5 .

    To illustrate the interface of these fields, we can mention 17, who considered a slightly modified version
    of Hotelling’s model, in which exists a tendency for both sellers to maximize their differentiation. This
    constitutes a counterexample to the conclusions originally presented by 18. By its turn, 19 provided
    the framework for a spatial competition model and the location of firms
4
    In 20, 21and 22 there is a useful compendium of spatial analysis techniques which points out the
    commonalities among models used to locate facilities one at a time and to forecast the economic
    development pattern in an entire region.
5
     A small sampling of topics that have been analyzed from the evolutionary perspective includes altruism
    (27) and behavior in public goods game (28).


                                                      2
        Considering the existent literature and the lack of contributions of EGT and ABS
approaches to spatial theories as mentioned before, in this work we develop a new model
that considers the projection made from the Regional Economic analysis for dynamically
guiding firms to the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS), i.e., to the optimal strategy
location decision in the long term, considering the possible occurrence of Brexit. The idea
behind an ESS is to ensure that a so called mutant strategy will not be able to dominate a
competitive environment that embraces the incumbent strategy. Furthermore, as explained
in 29, the EGT provides a refinement of the dynamic approach applied in the traditional
game theory, allowing an inference about which Nash Equilibrium (NE) corresponds to
an ESS. By it turns, the ABS method implements a stochastic learning rule in dynamic
equilibrium analysis and, in the face of more complex systems analysis, have provided
a robust way to find the ESS6 . Accordingly, using this dialogue among the metologies,
as evidenced by 33, a learning model based on the premise that agents have bounded
rationality is introduced to evaluate firms’ strategic locational decision.
        Therefore, we present a study of case with the objective of offering a reasonable
explanation about firms’ location patterns in the European Union countries due to the
possible occurrence of Brexit. In order to aim this goal, we evaluate the behavior of
firms under a new methodology. We consider that firms are competing in two different
sectors: (a) crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities (Sector 1);
(b) financial service activities, except insurance and pension funding (Sector 41). In the
evolutionary game presented here, we built the payoffs based on information received from
the input-output methods using the WIOD database.
        With the purpose of capturing the effects of exogenous variables that can affect
strategic location decisions, the payoffs incorporate weighted factors, whose weights vary
with each scenario we built. Since there are multiple possible outcomes that vary with
each weight we consider, our results show that the scenario and its inherent uncertainty
may affect the strategic decisions when the outputs cannot be predicted.
        On this matter, starting from an evolutionary perspective, the main objective of this
paper is to offer a reasonable contribution to the comprehension of the strategic behavior
pattern of firms’ spatial competition. Thus, we assume in our analysis representative
multinational firms that have to decide between United Kingdom (UK) and rest of
European Union (EU) whether to locate. To make that decision, firms assign probability
to the Brexit event and the following factors are considered: (i) potential market; (ii) local
productive interdependence; (iii) labor costs and (iv) Displacement Costs. In order to
reach our purpose and develop the discussion proposed in this introduction, this article
is subdivided into 4 more sections. Section 2 brings our methodology. The Evolutionary
Brexit Game is presented in section 3. The results will be analyzed and discussed in
section 4. Finally, section 5 will bring a brief conclusion and some important remarks to
be addressed in future research.


2 Methodology
2.1 Strategic Elements Evaluated in the Location Decision
       In order to develop the methodology, a game involving two types of firm is considered.
The T ypeA firm is situated in the rest of the European Union countries (EU) and assesses
the possibility of migrating to the United Kingdom (UK) in the face of the uncertainty
6
    See 30, 31 and 32.

surrounding Brexit. The T ypeB firm is situated in (UK) and assesses the possibility of
migrating to (EU). The payoffs of the game that mimic firms’ decision-making upon Brexit
occurrence were constructed based on the results of the regional input-output matrix,
made available by the WIOD for 2014, with sector opening of 43 countries and 56 sectors,
as well as an adjustment account called "Rest of the World".
       In addition, the 43 countries were aggregated so that the interregional input-output
matrix used in this paper contains the same 56 sectors for three regions: United Kingdom
(GBR), Rest of European Union (RoEU) and Rest of the World (RoW ).

2.2 Market Potential
       Firms see the maximization of the market area as an important factor in the
location decision (34, 8, 11). It can be measured by the input-output model, expressed as
in 35 by:

                                    X = (I − A)−1 F                                    (1)
where Xn×1 is a column vector with n rows, In×n is a dimension identity matrix n by n,
SAn×n is a matrix of technical coefficients, whose size is n × n, Fn×1 is the column vector
of final demand and (I − A)−1 is known in the economic literature as the inverse matrix
of Leontief, here denoted by B. Thus, we can rewrite equation (1) as follows:

                                        X = BF                                         (2)
       From 2 we can represent the model in its interregional form, as (36), by:

                                    BDX + F D = X                                      (3)

                                    BM X + F M = X                                     (4)

                                 µB D + µB M + Bv = µ                                  (5)
where B represents a n × n matrix of the coefficients for domestic production. F is a final
demand vector, of size 1 × n, which includes the gross fixed capital formation, public and
private consumption, and exports. M is a import vector n × 1. Bv is a vector of size 1 × n
which indicates the rate of value added on the total production for the sector i from the
country j. µ is a unit vector of size 1 × n. The overwritten D indicates that the variables
are domestic and the overwritten M indicates that the variables are exported. Subscribers
i and j indicates the sector and the country, respectively.
        Equations (3) and (4) represents the equilibrium conditions for the production of
domestic amd imported goods, respectively. Equation (5) is the equilibrium condition that
adds a constraint in the input-output coefficients. The sum of the elements on the rows of
the sector i in equation (3) must be equal to the sum of the sales for all domestic and
intermediate use in the economy for this same sector i.
        Similarly, in equation (4), the sum of the column elements j indicate the total
imports of the sector i, which must be equal to the sum of the sales of the product of
country j in the same sector for all users of the economy, including intermediate inputs
for all sectors, final household consumption and gross fixed capital formation. Finally,
the elements of equation (5) imply that the total production, X, in each sector i must


                                            4
be equal to the sum of the value added directly in the sector i and equal to the cost of
intermediate inputs for all domestic and imported production.
        In fact, the market potential for non-Brexit cases will be expressed as the sum of
the technical production coefficients for all i sectors of j countries of the European Union.
In the case of Brexit, the market potential will be measured by means of the hypothetical
extraction of the United Kingdom from the European Union 7 . The United Kingdom’s
market potential will be the sum of the United Kingdom’s own technical production
coefficients weighted by the intersectoral reduction of total production as a result of the
extraction of the sector j in the United Kingdom. The market potential of the Rest of the
European Union will be the sum of the technical coefficients of all i sectors of j countries
of the European Union and the complement of the United Kingdom’s market potential.

2.3 Productive Integration
       To measure the degree of productive integration, defined as the degree of productive
interdependence among i sectors of j countries, we made use of the value-added indicator
on gross exports (VAX rate), which is a traditional measure of the Global Value Chains.
The higher the coefficient, the lower the degree of productive integration of the country in
this segment (36, 39). Following 36, 40, 41, 42, we can obtain the domestic content from
an interregional model of input-output, as shown in equations (3) a (5), by:
                                                  0
                                      V AX = Av (I − A)−1 F DM                                          (6)
           0
       Av represents the row vector Av transposed share of total value added for the sector
i from the country j, of size 1 × n, (I − A)−1 is the inverse of Leontief and F DM is a
column vector of final demand for domestic D and imported M products. Each element of
the column vector of equation (6), with size n × 1, can be interpreted as the externally
share of value added in the production of exported domestic goods. According to 39, 40, it
can be considered as a measure of productive integration.

2.4 Labor Cost
       Firms consider that the cost of the labor force is a key variable for the location
decision process (43, 44, 3, 4, 5). Therefore, this variable should reflect the costs absorbed
by firms taking into account a skilled Ψ1 and unskilled Ψ2 labor force for the same amount
of production X in each sector i and in each country j. The cost of the high skilled labor
and low skilled labor can be obtained by the product between the participation of each
type of labor in the total remunerations 8 and the gross value of the production of each
sector i and for each country j, Xij .

2.5 Displacement Costs
       The displacement costs impact the relocation decision of firms (6, 46, 44). In this
sense, the higher the displacement costs, the lower the firm’s i availability to locate in
another j country. As an result, the displacement costs should mimic the firm’s ability
to obtain productive advantages associated with its relocation in the new region. For the
purposes of this paper, displacement costs are associated with differences in the share of

high skilled labor and low skilled labor between different countries for the same quantity
produced:

                                      µ = (ψ1ij − ψ2ij )Xij , ∀s                        (7)

                                  M = (Ψ1ij − Ψ2ij )Xij , ∀(1 − s)                      (8)
        Ψ1ij represents the share of the remuneration of high skilled labor over total
remuneration in the sector i of country j, Ψ2ij represents the share of the remuneration of
low skilled labor over total remuneration in the sector i of country j and Xij is the total
production in each sector i of country j. The intuition is that when the participation of
the high skilled labor in the sector i of country j is higher than the participation of the
low skilled labor, the cost of displacement is positive for the same amount of production
Xij . It indicates that the cost will be the same per unit of production, but with more
participation of the high skilled labor, which may represent, for example, productivity
gains (42, 24, 39).


3 The Evolutionary Brexit Game Model
        In an evolutionary game it is assumed bounded rationality, a large population, n,
of players (n → ∞) and an implicit recognition that agents learn. Every period, a player
is randomly matched with another player and they play a two-player game. Each agent
is randomly assigned a strategy at the initial step (t = 0), which can be updated over
time via the systematic interaction with other agents. Thus, one player can imitate other
players’ strategies.
        Following this intuition, now we intend to evaluate how robust is the strategic
behavior of firms that will decide whether to locate in the United Kingdom (U K) or the
rest of the European Union (EU ). Initially, the strategies available to each player are U K
and EU . Now, consider two representative firms tagged as firm A and firm B. Firm A
belongs to a population of firms that have a manufacturing plant in one of the European
Union member countries, excluding U K. Firm B belongs to a population of firms that
have a production plant in the U K.
        At each interaction, a firm tagged by type A randomly competes with a firm
tagged by type B. According to the evolutionary game theory approach, this situation
characterizes a two-dimensional9 game, in which two populations of firms compete against
each other. Players are invited to play multiple times and do not compete against their
peers. In this sense, there will only be competition among rivals’ population of firms. For
simplicity, the intra-population’s competition is not considered. The two population of
firms (Type A; Type B) evaluate the possibility of relocation according to the probability
of occurrence (s) or not (1 − s) of Brexit. Let the row player be one representative firm of
type A and the column player be one representative firm of type B. The payoff matrix of
the stage game is given by (9):

        The factors described in the previous section are contemplated in the game payoff
matrix. Thus, given the (non) occurrence of Brexit with probability (1 − s) s, the market
potential is given by (P) ρ. The measure of the productive integration is provided by
(Θ) θ. The factors (Ψ1 ) ψ1 and (Ψ2 ) ψ2 measures the cost of skilled and unskilled labor,
respectively. The displacement cost is given by (M) µ. The weight assigned to each of the
factors, conditioned to the (non) occurrence of Brexit with probability (1 − s) s is given
by (WI ) wi , where (I = {P, Θ, Ψ, M}) i = {ρ, θ, ψ, µ} and (ΣWI = 1) Σwi = 1. Generally,
we can understand the structure of payoffs presented in(9) as follows.
        If the Type A firm (row player) plays U K against a Type B firm (column player)
that plays U K, both will split the market but only the Type A firm incurs in displacement
costs, given that its production base is already established in EU . Thus, we have:
   A
  πuk,uk = s[1/2 wρ ρuk,uk + 1/2 wθ θuk,uk + 1/2 wψ (ψ1uk + ψ2uk ) − wµ µuk,uk ]+
      (1 − s) [1/2 WP Puk,uk + 1/2 WΘ Θuk,uk + 1/2 WΨ (Ψ1uk + Ψ2uk ) − WM Muk,uk ] (10)

In contrast, Type B firm, which already has a production base in the U K, will not incur
in displacement costs:
   B
  πuk,uk = s[1/2 wρ ρuk,uk + 1/2 wθ θuk,uk + 1/2 wψ (ψ1,uk + ψ2,uk )]+
                    (1 − s) [1/2 WP Puk,uk + 1/2 WΘ Θuk,uk + 1/2 WΨ (Ψ1,uk + Ψ2,uk )] (11)

The other payoffs in the game follow this structure. And the argument is analogous to the
case in which both firms are located in the EU . When firms adopt distinct localization
strategies, there will be no market splitting. In addition, they will not incur in displacement
costs if, and only if, they decide to remain located where they are already established.
        For simplicity, the payoff matrix presented in (9) is normalized. This procedure
will not affect the best response structure of the game and will simplify the analysis.
                         A        A               B        B                A        A
Assume that ηA = (πeu,uk     − πuk,uk ), ηB = (πeu,uk  − πuk,uk ), υA = (πeu,uk  − πuk,eu ), and
         B        B
υB = (πeu,eu − πuk,eu ). Players are randomly matched and compete against each other in a
one-shot game. The level of aggregate strategies of populations do not change all at once.
In fact, they continuously update their strategic behavior over time. The matrix (12) is
the basis of the evolutionary dynamics of the game.

Let fi be the fraction of firms using strategy U K in population i, so the fraction of firms
adopting EU in population i is 1 − fi , i = A, B. The observed variations in the proportion
of players who adopt each of the strategies reflects their evolutionary process within each
population. Note that this relative frequency can be understood as the probability that a
player will play a given strategy. Both the evolution of the game and the strategic behavior
of the firms is conditioned to the fitness of their strategies.
        The fitness, according to 47 and 48, depends on the player’s payoff for a given
strategy and on the relative frequency of the strategies observed in both populations.
That is, players make decisions based on the expected utility of their payoffs. As we will
see in the results section, it is possible that from the normalized matrix (12) we have a

situation in which more than one Nash equilibrium compose the solution set. Therefore,
the following question arises: departing from an initial game condition, which equilibrium
will be reached?
         Without loss of generality, to answer this question, we first analyze the evolution
and the robustness of firm’s strategic behavior with the analytic solution of the replicator
dynamics (RD) system (49), which is a very general ordinary differential equation (ODE)
system in evolutionary game theory. As presented in 50, in a dynamic system, the growth
rate f˙A /fA equals the strategy U K’s fitness e1 A(fB , 1 − fB )T less the average fitness
(fA , 1 − fA )A(fB , 1 − fB )T of population A, where f˙A = dfA /dt and e1 = (1, 0) represents
that all firms from population  A chooses strategy U K.

         Let A =                be the payoff matrix of a representative firm A. After

                        0 υA
some trivial matrix algebra, the replicator dynamics equation for population A is f˙A =
fA ((e1 − (fA , 1 − fA ))A(fB , 1 − fB )T . Substituting the values of A (payoffs earned by the
representative firm A), in order to derive the replicator dynamics system for population A
and B:
                             f˙A = fA (1 − fA )[ηA fB − υA (1 − fB )]                      (13)

                              f˙B = fB (1 − fB )[ηB fA − υB (1 − fA )]                         (14)
        f˙A and f˙B represent the growth rate of the proportion of firms that adopt the
first pure strategy (U K) within each population (A and B). The stability of the system
is a coordinate (fA , fB ) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1], in which f˙A = f˙B = 0 is a necessary condition
for the stationarity of (13) and (14). To check the stability of the points candidates

3.1 Agent Based Simulation Algorithm
      In this subsection, an algorithm to complement the evolutionary game and to guide
the dynamic interaction among firms is presented. In this way, a stochastic component is
implemented11 in the analysis of evolutionary equilibria using the ABS method, which has

been largely used in the understanding of the evolution of cooperative behavior in social
dilemmas12 , as can be seen in (31) and (32).
       To implement the computational simulation, the intuition presented by (32) is
followed. In this sense, at a time t = 0, we establish an initial proportion of firms’ A
and B in each population, (fA , fB ), that play each one of the pure strategies available.
Evolutionary dynamics are introduced in sequence and, at each Monte Carlo time Step
(MCS), a Focal Agent i, which can update13 its strategy, is chosen randomly. This occurs
simultaneously in both populations. Focal Agent i, in turn, plays against a random
opponent from the rival population and starts the game presented in matrix (9). Thus,
Focal Agent i will obtain a payoff Vi . At the same time, an agent j is randomly chosen as a
Reference Agent, which randomly plays against an opponent from the rival population and
obtains a payoff Vj . Notice that focal and reference players belong to the same population.
The Focal Agent i compares Vi and Vj to analyze the possibility of updating his strategy
in two stages as stated ahead: (i) If Vi ≥ Vj , focal player keeps his strategy; (ii) If Vi < Vj ,
focal player might update his strategy to the one adopted by reference player with a
probability given by the variable w:
                                                Vj − Vi
                                  w=                                                                 (15)
                                        max.payof f − min.payof f
         The maximum and minimum payoffs are obtained from the game matrix. By doing
this procedure, we guarantee that w ∈ (0, 1). To establish a decision criterion whether
Focal Agent i updates his strategy or not, a random number generator is used, and is
conveniently named rnd ∈ (0, 1). In this way, a stochastic component on the dynamics of
the game is implemented. Focal Agent i compares rnd with the probability w, so that:
(iii) If w ≥ rnd, Focal Agent i updates its strategy and imitates the Reference Agent j;
(iv) If w ≤ rnd, Focal Agent i does not update its strategy.
         At every MCS, randomly selected individuals from both populations have the
opportunity to, on average, change strategy at least once, comparing their payoffs with
the Reference Agent j. We say that, on average, individuals can update strategies once,
because within a MCS the same player may be invited to play many times, and other
players may not, since the process of players’ selection is random. Thus, when all players
in both populations, on average, have the opportunity to update their strategies, a MCS
is completed and a new MCS starts in order to repeat the dynamics of the game. This
procedure characterizes the ABS model.

3.2 Spatial-structured Two-population
       When applying this procedure in regular lattices, the number of opponents with
which individuals interact depends on the spatial arrangement of the game and directly
impacts the value of w. It is important to notice that, in a spatial-structured network, the
concept of local neighborhood emerges, and there only will be competition among players
that belong to certain positions in the N × N dimensional matrix.

     In (30), the study of social dilemmas is defined as the study of the conflict between individual and
     collective rationality. In a social dilemma, individually reasonable behavior leads to a situation in
     which everyone is worse off.
13
     Two mechanisms to update the population regarding the strategic interactions are largely used in
     agent based simulation methods: synchronous and asynchronous. Here, we use the second, since it
     allows the overlapping generations interactions. See (52) and (31).

           Figure 1 – Interaction among players in a spatial- structure population.


         Figure 1 presents an illustration of the two-dimensional game dynamics in a spatial-
structure format. It is possible to identify the neighborhood of each focal and reference
agent according to their position in the matrix. In this paper we consider the von-Neuman14
neighborhood. Suppose that the element {a33 }, ilustred on the right side of Figure 1, is the
focal agent that is programmed to play the strategy U K. According to the von-Neuman
neighborhood, the reference agent of {a33 }, i.e., the one which he will compare his payoff,
to decide whether he updates his strategy or not, could be randomly selected between the
elements {a34 , a32 , a23 , a43 }. Suppose, for example, that {a34 }, who is programmed to play
EU , is selected as the reference agent.
         The elements of the rival population (B) with which the focal agent {a33 } competes
are {b33 , b23 , b43 , b34 , b32 }. The reference agent {a34 } competes with the individuals located
at {b34 , b33 , b35 , b24 , b44 }. The same interaction happens simultaneously in the opposite
direction, that is, there is competition between players of population B with the population
A and vice verse. Attention should be paid in considering the strategic interactions of those
players located on the border of the spatial structure. The local neighbor with which element
{a11 } randomly selects to compare his payoff is one of the elements {a51 , a21 , a15 , a12 } and
the set of players from the rival population that {a11 } compete are located in the cells
{b11 , b12 , b15 , b21 , b51 }. In this matter, we can see the spatial structure similar to a toroid15 .
         The strategy update criterion is calculated by the average payoff of each player,
founded by the arithmetic mean of the payments (V ) obtained in each interaction with
the n players that compose the local neighborhood. The Focal Agent i and the Reference
Agent j now receive a payoff given by, respectively:

       As explained before, if Vj > Vi , the focal agent may imitate reference agents’
strategic behavior with probability w. Note that w is based on the averages received by
the focal and reference agents. The worse the focal players’ performance in relation to the
reference, the greater the probability that he imitates reference agents’ strategy.

       To generate the following results, we assign weights to the variables obtained from
the input-output16 analysis for sectors 1 and 41. Table 2 summarizes the values chosen
for each of the evaluated cases. In the homogeneous scenario, firms are considering that
the probability of Brexit occurrence is s = 1/2 and they are attributing homogeneous
weights for each of the factors considered. In scenario II it is assigned a high probability of
Brexit occurrence, (s = 0.7), with firms attributing more weight to the variables associated
with market potential(θ, Θ) and productive integration (ρ, P). In scenario III it is also
considered a high probability of occurrence of Brexit (s = 0.7), with firms assigning greater
weight to the variables associated with labor cost (ψ, Ψ) and displacement cost (µ, M).

4.1       Homogeneous Scenario
        The homogeneous scenario features a unique balance for both Sector 1 and Sector 41.
In figure 2 we present the phase diagrams. The black dots correspond to the ESS strategies
and the white dots are unstable. The colors of the phase diagram can be interpreted as
follows: the region in red (blue) corresponds to the maximum (lowest) speed of convergence
of the system. In this way, let ΦESS be the set of evolutionary stable strategies. For firms
operating in Sector 1 and in Sector 41, we have ΦESS = {(U K, EU )}. Note that the ESS
matches with the Nash equilibrium.

        We observed firms that were initially operating in the EU updating its locational
decision to U K. On the other hand, firms established in U K, observing this movement, will
do the opposite movement, that is, they will start to migrate to EU . The economic intuition
of this equilibrium is that firms has some benefits when incurring at the displacement cost,
since it relocates in an unsaturated market. Therefore, we observe that this result may
reflect the characteristics of Sector 1, since costs of labor and costs of displacement are
relatively low. Another argument may be due to the low product differentiation in this
sector. The economic intuition of this result reflects that the benefits of exploring a new
market outweigh the displacement costs in a scenario of high uncertainty and homogeneous
weights for the factors considered in the location decision.

        By considering a low level of spatial desegregation, in addition to not providing
greater relevance to any of the factors considered in the analysis, there is a need to better
evaluate the trade-off between the advantages of agglomeration (ρ and θ) and production
costs (ψ and µ). In addition, another relevant issue is to know more precisely in which
of the EU countries firms will decide to locate. In this sense, we apply the ABS model
presented in subsections 3.1 and 3.2 in order to better evaluate and understand the dynamic
equilibrium of the spatial competition among firms.
        As previously described, there are results in the literature that emphasize a robust-
ness between the analytical solution of the replicator dynamics (RD) and that obtained
through numerical simulations via ABS. By comparing figure 2 with figures 3 and 4, we can
observe the convergence between the methods of evaluation of the spatial game. In MCS 1,
the initial distribution of the available strategies for the homogeneous scenario is obtained.
For both sector 1 (top) and sector 41 (bottom), market shares were considered as the initial
condition of the game, i.e., (fU K 1 ; fEU 1 ) = (0.18; 0.82) and (fU K 41 ; fEU 41 ) = (0.52; 0.48).
        From then on, notice that the learning rule is linked to the spatial neighborhood
competition. In other words, observing a higher relative frequency of firms playing EU in
MCS 10, there is an increase in the relative frequency of firms adopting the U K strategy in
both populations. As already stated, this graphically illustrates the search for unsaturated
markets. This movement is interrupted as the frequency of firms playing U K in both
populations rises concomitantly - which equals the cost-benefit ratio of relocation. In MCS
30, we observe a large clustering of type A firms playing U K, while type B firms choose
to update their strategy towards U K. Finally, from figure 3, the balance occurs with type
A firms migrating to U K and type B firms migrating to EU . From this homogeneous
scenario, we might conclude that the benefit from the less exploited market outweighs the
costs of moving towards this market. The rationale is analogous for sector 41.

       Using the convergence between RD and ABS obtained in this scenario, only the
numerical simulation method will be applied in order to evaluate scenarios II and III. By
increasing the number of available strategies for each player our analysis will be more
complex, making the analytical treatment very costly and difficult to estimate.

4.2 Scenario II
        Based on the homogeneous scenario, it is possible to observe that the equilibrium
in the location decision depend on the sectoral characteristics and the dichotomy between
the advantages associated to the productive integration and the displacement costs. These
outcomes suggest that it is possible to evaluate location decisions due to a greater degree
of country desegregation and by attributing different weights for each of the strategic
variables for the location decision.
        Following in this direction, scenario II assigns greater weights to the variables
associated with the agglomeration advantages such as market potential, (ρ, P), and
productive integration, (θ, Θ), (8, 9, 10, 11). Therefore, the regions were desegregated in
accordance to their relevance in terms of market potential and productive integration, as
expressed in Table 2, available in the appendix. For sector I, in addition to the U K and
EU , Luxembourg (LU ) and Portugal (P O) countries were included as strategies.

          From the payoff matrix, we can see that for both sector 1 and sector 41, the proposed
desegregation was able to provide a more accurate analysis about firms’ location decision. It
is still possible to identify that U K and EU strategies are strictly dominated by LU and P O
in sector 1, and by F R and F I in sector 41. Thus, considering (fU K 1 ; fEU 1 ; fLU 1 ; fP O1 ) =
(0.16; 0.76; 0.04; 0.04), the dynamic balance of the game consists of the LU and P O
strategies. The result suggests that, although initially few firms adopt the strategy of
locating in Luxembourg or Portugal, to the extent that this behavior generates larger
payoffs, neighboring firms tend to imitate it. This process is visible at the left side of figure

population of firms migrating to P O and by the other population migrating to LU 17 .

       Similarly, considering (fU K 41 ; fEU 41 ; fF R41 ; fF I 41 ) = (0.38; 0.34; 0.26; 0.02), U K and
EU strategies are strictly dominated by F R and F I. So, the economic intuition suggests
that, despite the peculiarities attached to each sector, a behavioral pattern is observed.
Firms always decide to locate in countries where they observe greater advantages of
agglomeration, reflected by ρ and θ. This result is maintained even when we assign higher
probabilities to the occurrence of Brexit.

          By it turns, for sector 41 the following countries are listed as possible destinations:
(fU K 1 ; fEU 1 ; fGR1 ; fF I 1 ; fDE 1 ; fAU 1 ) = (0.33; 0.29; 0.03; 0.02; 0.29; 0.04). In the same way as
in the previous scenario, it is possible to observe a behavioral pattern in the locational
decision of firms. The results show an equilibrium in dominant strategy for both sectors.
          Thus, in the face of Brexit’s uncertainty, if firms uphold their location decision on
the factors associated with cost minimization, the observed net effect is that firms initially
established in both the U K and the EU will re-establish themselves in the French and
German markets for sectors 1 and 41, respectively. The fact that convergence has occurred
more rapidly in sector 41 may be linked to greater mobility of the productive factors in this
sector. On the other hand, sector 1, which is strongly associated with natural resources,
showed a slower convergence. So, the result may suggest that in the case in which one
firm bases its decision on the advantages of cost minimization, indirectly, it will take into
account the degree of productive integration in order to maximize the payoff utility.

5 Conclusion
        The objective of this article was to analyze the influence of Brexit on firm’s location
decision. In order to achieve this goal, we proposed a model based on the bounded rationality
assumptions. From then on, a stochastic learning rule was created, in which the agents
could imitate the behavior of neighboring firms over time with a probability generated
from the relative distance between the payoffs earned. Two sectors with very particular
characteristics were chosen: (i) Sector 1, Crop and animal production, hunting and related
service activities, characterized by high locational advantages, strong dependence on
natural resources and largely subsidized by local governments; (ii) Sector 41, Financial
services activities, except insurance and pension funding, characterized by being a service
provider, with high integration and relevance in the United Kingdom economy.
        Thus, the results indicated that the occurrence of Brexit can be determinant in
the decision of firm location. It was possible to find evidence that it may modify the
distribution of the relevant geographic market on the European continent. On this matter,
the sensitivity of the firms due to the Brexit is conditioned to the sector of performance
and the relevance given to each of the factors evaluated in the decision process. In this
sense, in sectors associated with high locational advantages, strong dependence on natural
resources and traditionally benefited by fiscal subsidies, the prospect of Brexit indicates
that in an environment of uncertainty, firms tend to search for unsaturated markets.
        Given the above, we can observe the following behavior pattern of firms for the
proposed game: (a) if the greater motivation is tied to agglomerative advantages, the
associated displacement costs are irrelevant, and firms always see greater benefits when
moving from the host country; (b) on the other hand, when the strategic variable is
cost minimization, firms weigh these factors (indirectly) with regions that have greater
productive integration, so that they can maximize the utility of their payoff.
        Therefore, when firms determine the degree of agglomeration as a key variable in
their location decision making, we observe from the desegregation proposed in scenario
II, that the most successful strategy for a firm competing in sector 1 (41) is to migrate
to LU or P O (F R or F I). In the opposite direction, If they are concerned with cost
minimization, firms in sector 1 (41) decide to locate in France (Germany). Note that under
these conditions, they see greater benefits in dividing the same market. This suggests that
the advantages found in such regions outweigh the costs linked to the displacement of the
productive base. Therefore, the net effect is a migration of firms previously established in
both the U K and the EU to France and Germany, respectively.
        Concluding, there are many direction to extent this research. One could consider
a different degree of desegregation of countries and other productive factors. Another
possibility is to elaborate a payoff structure of the game in which it is possible to endogenize
the sensitivity of the game balance according to the incentive of the "nth firm" to migrate,
given the proportion of its rivals that have already made that decision.
