       Abstract. In this paper we use a flash flood that occurred in the Brazilian state
       of Santa Catarina in 2008 to investigate the existence of spatial spillovers from nat-
       ural disasters in geographically linked areas. For that, we estimate a difference-in-
       differences model that explicitly allows for the existence of spatial interactions within
       affected and non-affected regions. Our results show that municipalities directly af-
       fected by the flood suffered a 8.47% decrease in GDP per capita on the year of the
       disaster. Three years after the flood however GDP per capita rebounded back to
       pre-disaster levels in all sectors but the Agricultural sector. Finally, our spatial esti-
       mations show that spillovers exist and are economically relevant.

       Resumo. Este artigo utiliza as fortes chuvas ocorridas em Santa Catarina, no ano de
       2008, para investigar a existência de spillovers espaciais em decorrência do desastre
       natural em regiões geograficamente relacionadas. Utiliza-se o método de diferença-
       em-diferenças que explicitamente permite a existência de interações espaciais entre
       regiões afetadas e não afetadas. Os resultados mostram que os municípios direta-
       mente afetados sofreram uma queda de cerca de 8,47% no PIB per capita no ano do
       desastre. Três anos depois, no entanto, o PIB per capita retorna ao nível pré-disastre
       em todos os setores da economia, com exceção do setor agrícola. Por fim, os estima-
       dores espaciais mostram que spillovers existem e são economicamente relevantes.

   In this paper we use a flash flood that occurred in the Brazilian state of Santa Cata-
rina in 2008 to investigate the existence of spatial spillovers from natural disasters in
geographically linked areas. For that we compare the GDP trajectory of municipalities
affected by the flash flood to the trajectory of municipalities not affected by the flood in
the years immediately before and after the occurrence of the disaster using a difference-
in-differences model that explicitly considers temporal dynamics (Autor et al., 2008;
Husby et al., 2014) and allows for the existence of spatial interactions within affected
and non-affected regions (along the lines of Delgado and Florax (2015)). While the
literature analyzing the economic effects of natural disasters is quite large, spatial in-
teractions – to the author’s knowledge – have been largely overlooked and neglected in
previous studies. Our study therefore aims at answering the following two questions:
first, what was the economic effects of this natural disaster on directly affected munic-
ipalities? Second, and more importantly, how much (if any) were neighbouring regions
indirectly affected by it?

2         NATURAL DISASTERS, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SPATIAL SPILLOVERS

   The direct impacts of environmental catastrophes have for long been in the research
agenda of empirical economists, specially considering the huge effects that tsunamis,
hurricanes, earthquakes and flooding may cause to economies throughout the world.
For instance, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction
(UNISDR), between 2000 and 2012 natural disasters affected the lives of 2.9 billion
people, killed around 1.2 million people and caused more than $1.7 trillion worth of
economic damage. In the United States, the Hurricane Katrina, one of the strongest
storms to impact the coast of the country during the last 100 years, left about mil-
lions of homeless and an economic impact of approximately $150 billion (Neumayer,
Plümper, and Barthel, 2014).
   These massive shocks led many to wonder about the true effect of a natural disaster.
From a theoretical perspective, the notion that environmental disasters might have
permanent long-run effects on income is not obvious (Hsiang and Jina, 2014). Income
response to shocks may depend on the type and magnitude of the environmental disrup-
tion (Kahn, 2005) as well as on the level of development and institutional arrangement.
More developed societies for instance may experience lower human and economic losses
when compared to less well-off societies (Kahn, 2005; Toya and Skidmore, 2007; Noy,
2009).
   Following this rationale, prior literature have laid out four competing possibilities
for the growth trajectory succeeding a shock. The first, known as the “no recovery”
possibility, argues that a natural disaster may result in damage to infrastructure and
physical capital, which hinders the capital accumulation and thus negatively affects the
rate of economic growth. In addition, the disaster can also alter business expectations,
scaring away new investments and may trigger the migration of skilled and educated
workers to unaffected areas (Barone and Mocetti, 2014), leaving post-disaster output
to be permanently lower than its pre-disaster trajectory. A second possibility, the
“recovery to trend” hypothesis, argues that a short-run negative shock exists but income
levels should converge in the long-run back to their pre-disaster trend. According to
Strobl (2011) and Yang (2008), the rebound back to pre-disaster trend may occur
because individuals and wealth will migrate into devastated locations due to increases
in the marginal product of capital when capital and labor become relatively scarce
after the disaster due to destruction and mortality.
   A third possibility, the “build back better” hypothesis, states that the shock may
generate incentives for gradually building new and more efficient infra-structure com-
pared to the capital that was destroyed in the disaster, leading to a positive net effect
on long-run income levels (Cuaresma et al., 2008). A final possibility, known as “cre-
ative destruction” hypothesis, argues that income may increase in the short-run due
to greater inflow of financial aid arising from donations and loans and to increases in
demand for goods and services as destroyed capital is replaced with new assets. The
environmental disruption may even provide the impetus to adopt new technologies,
leading to improvements in total factor productivity (Skidmore and Toya, 2002).
   From an empirical perspective, the debate however is far from settled. Cross-country
evidence provide mixed empirical support for the hypotheses considered. Cavallo et al.
(2013) for instance found no statistical relation between catastrophic natural disasters
and economic growth, neither in the short nor long-run; the only exception occur-
ring in extremely large disasters that were followed by radical political revolutions.
More recently, Hsiang and Jina (2014), who analyzed 6,700 tropical cyclones during
1950-2008, showed that there was a long-term contraction in the income of affected
countries.1 The analysis based on cross-country data however may be subject to bias.

First, with few exceptions, natural disasters occur in very specific areas, making the
assumption that the entire country has been affected a little implausible. Second,
since in the cornerstone of these analysis is the assumption that treated and untreated
countries can be compared, substantial unobserved, and difficult to control for, hetero-
geneity across countries may prevent one from obtaining a clean identification of causal
effects. These motivated researchers to focus on investigating the economic impacts of
natural hazards from a regional perspective, analyzing specific events and using more
disaggregated data.
   Along this line, Xiao et al. (2013) recently investigated the economic effects of the
1993 flood that occurred in the Midwest region of the United States using a matching
algorithm to select non-flooded control counties and an ARIMA intervention model.
They showed that the flood caused severe economic disturbances, mostly in the short-
run, although a persistent contraction in the agricultural sector was observed. Barone
and Mocetti (2014) examined two large-scale earthquakes that occurred in two different
Italian regions in 1976 and 1980, one in the Friuli region (north of the country) and
other in the Irpina region (south of the country). Using a synthetic control approach,
the authors show that, discounting financial aid, both quakes had a negative impact in
the short-term GDP. In the long-run however their findings indicate a positive effect
in one case and a negative effect in the other. While the Friule region experienced
increases to its per capita GDP, the Irpina region suffered a 12% decrease in GDP per
capita. They suggest that differences in institutional quality between the regions may
explain post disaster behaviors.
   Using nightlight data from satellite images, Elliott et al. (2015) evaluated the impact
of typhoons on economic activity in the coastal area of China. The results show that
typhoons generated heavy short-term losses to the local economy. Their estimates
also show a net economic loss of U$ 28.34 billion from 1992 to 2010. Tanaka (2015)
investigated the economic impact of an Earthquake that struck the Japanese city of
Kobe, in 1995. Using plant level data and a methodology based on a difference-in-
differences strategy with matching, the author showed that the plants that survived
in Kobe’s most devastated districts experienced severe negative shocks to employment
and value added growth during the following three years after the quake.
   While the main motivation of these cross-country and cross-regional papers has been
to investigate the positive/negative effects of natural disasters on economic outcomes,2
issues related to spatial interactions have largely been overlooked. This is especially
important in cross-regional analysis, since economies interact with each other, either
through commercial transactions, labor mobility, technology diffusion and/or sharing
of infrastructure assets (Ertur and Koch, 2007; LeSage and Fischer, 2008; Sardadvar,
2012). It is reasonable therefore to expect that neighbouring regions also suffer the
consequences of a natural disaster, even indirectly. For instance, the destruction of
important infrastructures, such as bridges and highways, might compromise economic
growth of all economies that share its use in some way (Crescenzi and Rodríguez-
Pose, 2012). Additionally, when a region suffers a negative shock, their ability to
transact goods and disburse funds for new investments is reduced, compromising also
the performance of neighbouring areas who would eventually benefit from spillover
effects. Therefore, ignoring spatial interactions by treating regions as isolated islands
may cause the model to (potentially) underestimate the economic consequences of
natural disasters.
2
    Recently, researchers started using micro-level data to investigate the long run effects and inter-
    generational transmission of disasters on individual’s outcomes. See, for instance, Vigdor (2008);
    Imberman et al. (2012); Caruso (2015).
4          NATURAL DISASTERS, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SPATIAL SPILLOVERS

   Our study aims to contribute to this literature by explicitly considering the spatial
interactions of natural disasters. We evaluate therefore not only the direct effect of
the disaster, but allow our difference-in-differences model to capture also the indirect
effects of the shock on neighbouring regions. For that, we apply the spatial extension of
the difference-in-differences estimator recently proposed by Delgado and Florax (2015).
As a case study, we investigate the economic impact of the flash flood that occurred
on the northern coast of the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina in 2008. According to
the state’s Civil Defense, this was the worst disaster in the state history, with over
1.5 million people affected, 32,853 displaced, 5,617 homeless and 135 killed. This is
an interesting case to be evaluated, since it occurred in a relatively rich region of a
developing country3. In addition to considering spillover effects, our paper is among
the few that use disaggregated data at municipality level to evaluate how each of the
three economic sectors – agriculture, industry and services – respond to the flash flood.
   Our difference-in-differences results show that municipalities directly affected by the
flood suffered a 10% decrease in GDP per capita on the year following the disaster.
Three years after the flood however GDP per capita rebounded back to pre-disaster
levels; the only exception occurring in the agricultural sector, which experienced a
decrease of about 22% in the first year after the shock and a statistically significant
decrease of about 8% three years after the flood. Regarding our spatial estimations,
our results show that spillovers exist and are economically relevant. We find an indirect
impact of the flash flood of about -1.4% to -3.6%. In this way, ignoring the spatial
spillovers leads to an underestimation of disasters effects and can generate sub-optimal
recovery policies.
   Our study is structured as follows: in section 2 we describe the study area and
provide details about the natural disaster to be evaluated. Section 3 presents the
empirical strategy and section 4 describes the data and variables used in the analysis.
In section 5 we present the results and in section 6 we discuss the main empirical
findings and policy implications.

                                  2. The 2008 Flash Flood
   Our study area comprises the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, located in the south-
ern part of Brazil. With an area of 95,736.165 km2 , the state has a population of 6.8
million inhabitants and is one of the most developed regions in the country, with a
GDP per capita of R$ 29,350 (IBGE, 2013). Compared to other Brazilian states, Santa
Catarina has the lowest illiteracy rate (3.2%), the lowest infant mortality rate (9.49%),
the highest life expectancy (78.77 years) and the lowest levels of income inequality
(Brazilian Demographic Census, 2010).
   The state is located in a geographic area highly vulnerable to natural hazards. From
1992 to 2012, according to official records provided by Brazilian Atlas of Natural Disas-
ter (2012), the state registered 4,999 natural disasters, 34% of those being flash floods,
followed by dry spells and droughts (30%), windstorms (13%), hail (11%) and floods
(9%). The flash floods and floods4 occur predominantly in the basin of the Itajaí River
(northeastern region of Santa Catarina) and its potential for destruction is amplified
3
 To our knowledge, the study of Ribeiro et al. (2014) is the only one that assesses the economic
 impact of this event. Using a synthetic control method, the authors show that the flash flood caused
 a monthly reduction of 5.13% in industrial production in the state of Santa Catarina. A drawback of
 their analysis is the use of aggregate data at the state level, which can lead to imprecise estimates,
 especially since the disaster occurred in a very specific and concentrated area of the state.
4The flash floods differ from floods due to their sudden occurrence, being caused by heavy rains (short
 time), having quick shifts and are more associated with hilly areas.

due to increasing urbanization pressures on the natural environment (Stevaux et al.,
2009). These events often occur in the summer and spring seasons, due to increases
in wet that facilitates tropical convections and to the mesoscale convective complexes
(MCC), specifically favoring the occurrence of flash floods (Brazilian Atlas of Natural
Disaster, 2012).

   In November 2008, the state of Santa Catarina was hit by a series of heavy rains
that resulted in a catastrophic flash flood, impacting more than seventy cities concen-
trated in the northeast area of the state. In the affected municipalities, like Blumenau
and Joinville, total rainfall of November 2008 almost surpassed 1,000 mm, way above
Novembers’ historic average of 150 mm. In the case of Blumenau, for instance, such
volume exceeded total rainfall observed in October 2008 by 355%. Figure 1 gives us a
clear picture of the magnitude of the phenomenon. The figure plots the monthly rain-
fall observed in November/2008 and the maximum historic values recorded by Epagri,
a Santa Catarina government think tank, and the National Water Agency (ANA) for
five affected cities.
   According to Stevaux et al. (2009), the event was a result of two simultaneous weather
events: a high pressure anticyclone that spread in the southern Atlantic Ocean coast
and a cyclonic vortex of low pressure, which caused the ascension of air masses and
the formation of rain clouds. The 2008 flash flood caused immense human damage
due to landslides. According to the Civil Defense of Santa Catarina, 1.5 million people
were affected by the event, 32,853 were displaced, 5,617 were homeless and 135 were
killed. The severity of the 2008 event was such that it accounts for 80.3% of deaths
from all flash floods that have occurred in the state during the period from 1992 to
2012 (Brazilian Atlas of Natural Disaster, 2012).
   In terms of economic damage, the natural disaster occurred in an area with high
industrial concentration and affected major urban centers like Florianópolis, Blumenau,
Joinville and Itajaí, cities that concentrate 34.4% of the state GDP and 22.8% of its
population (Brazilian Demographic Census, 2010). Regarding the infrastructure, the
6         NATURAL DISASTERS, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SPATIAL SPILLOVERS

floods and landslides caused interceptions on roadways and highways, disrupted the
Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline (Gasbol), interrupted business in the Itajaí harbor, caused
the destruction of agricultural assets and deteriorated most residential capital around
the affected region. In the state, 63 municipalities declared state of emergency and 14
declared a state of public calamity. Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of
these municipalities.

  Due to its tremendous socioeconomic consequences and the amount of lives affected,
the November 2008 disaster is considered by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) and by the United Nations (UN) as the worst catastrophe in the history of
the state of Santa Catarina.

                                3. Empirical Strategy
   In this section, we first present the empirical strategy we adopt to identify the impact
of the 2008 Santa Catarina flash flood on GDP per capita of affected municipalities.
We then describe the method through which we investigate the existence of potential
spillover effects.
   Direct effects. Regarding the direct effects of the 2008 Santa Catarina flash flood
on GDP, we start with a standard municipal-level fixed-effects model that calculates
the difference between the GDP before and after the flash flood for treated and un-
treated municipalities. This strategy, widely used in all areas of empirical economics,
has recently been used to measure the economic impact of unanticipated natural dis-
asters on a regional perspective by Husby et al. (2014) and Tanaka (2015). Our basic
specification is given by the following equation:
                                       X
(3.1)          yit = φF loodi2008 +            ηk F loodik + γXit + µi + λt + εit ,
                                      k>2008

where yit is the log of GDP per capita of municipality i at year t, F loodi2008 is a
dummy variable that assumes the value of 1 if municipality i was affected by the
natural disaster in 2008 and 0 otherwise, and F loodik , where k > 2008, are dummy
variables representing treatment effects for k years after 2008. Xit is a vector of controls
and µi and λt are, respectively, municipality and year fixed effects. εit is an error term,
             NATURAL DISASTERS, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SPATIAL SPILLOVERS                    7

clustered at the municipality level in all estimations to allow for an arbitrary covariance
structure within municipalities over time.
   The municipality fixed effect included in the model control non-parametrically for
municipality time-invariant unobservable characteristics, such as municipalities fixed
geographical aspects. The time fixed effect control nonparametrically for yearly dif-
ferences in GDP level common to all municipalities, such as macroeconomic aspects
that can affect GDP. Finally, the vector of municipality characteristics, Xit , controls
for time-varying characteristics that might be correlated with the shock and with mu-
nicipalities GDP.5
   The parameters of interest are given by φ and ηk , for k > 2008. φ represents the
causal effect of the shock on GDP for the first year directly affected by the treatment.
It calculates therefore the difference between the average of the outcome of interest
for the first year after the shock minus the average of this outcome before the shock
for treated and untreated municipalities. In a similar manner, ηk allows us to evaluate
the time heterogeneity of the impact (temporal dynamics), assessing therefore if the
impact of the natural disaster is temporary or persistent.
   As is widely known, to interpret these parameters as causal we must rely on the
assumption that there is no time-varying unobserved variable that is simultaneously
correlated with our treatment and outcome variables, hence excluding the possibility
of omitted variable bias (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). Although this assumption may
seem strong for several empirical applications, we highlight that the natural disaster
we analyze is hardly anticipated. Municipalities can predict rainfall a few days/hours
before it happens, but not months before. Hence, simple comparison between affected
and non-affected region may deliver the causal effect of interest.
   We note however that a few natural disasters, such as floods and flash floods, may
impact certain regions more frequently than others. It might be therefore that these
regions may invest more in disaster preparedness, alleviating the potential impacts of
a flood. If these investment differences changes between municipalities but are fixed
across time, the municipality fixed effect we include in the model should be sufficient to
allow for a causal interpretation of the estimates. If however investment changes across
the time span we consider in our analysis, then we might face problems in identifying
the isolated impact of the 2008 flash flood. We note however that preparedness tends to
alleviate destruction, making our estimates likely to be a lower bound of the potential
effect.
   As it follows, although we cannot directly test if trajectories differ substantially be-
tween treated and control municipalities, since we cannot observe the treated group in
the absence of treatment (Angrist and Pischke, 2008), we can test the robustness of our
estimates to the existence of dynamic changes that might coincide with the occurrence
of the flood. For that, we consider estimating model 3.1 with additional dummies in-
dicating years before the disaster. We check therefore whether causes happen before
consequences, in line with Granger (1969), by allowing the model to have heteroge-
neous anticipatory effects (leads), denoted by F loodik , where k < 2008, in addition to
the heterogeneous post-treatment effects (lags) already included in the model (Autor,
2003). We estimate therefore:
               X                                  X
(3.2) yit =          ωk F loodik + φF loodi2008 +      ηk F loodik + γXit + µi + λt + εit .
                 k<2008                                 k>2008

  If the model we estimate in equation 3.1 incorrectly attributes pre-existing trends
in the outcome to our treatment effect, then dummies indicating years before the
5In   the next section we specify in more detail the variables included in this vector.
8         NATURAL DISASTERS, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SPATIAL SPILLOVERS

occurrence of the flash flood should matter in equation 3.2 and anticipatory effects,
captured in ωk , should show up as significant.
   Indirect effects. Moving to estimates of potential spillover effects, we relax an
important assumption required for the validity of the basic difference-in-differences
estimator which is the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). This as-
sumption implies that potential outcomes for the unit i are unrelated to treatment
status of units j (Angrist et al., 1996; Delgado and Florax, 2015). As we argue above,
however, we expect to find significant spillover effects within the municipalities stud-
ied because of spatial dependence between local economies. In fact, there are strong
evidences in favor of a positive spatial relation in the economic growth of Brazilian
regional economies (Resende, 2011; Özyurt and Daumal, 2013; Lima and Silveira Neto,
2016).
   Following this rationale, we apply the spatial extension of the difference-in-differences
estimator recently proposed by Delgado and Florax (2015). This strategy allows us to
explicitly consider the local spatial dependence of the treatment variable, so that the
outcome of municipality i depends not only on their own treatment, but also on the
treatment status of close neighbors. This framework has been increasingly adopted in
the impact evaluation literature (Heckert and Mennis, 2012; Chagas et al., 2016; Dubé
et al., 2014) to measure spatial treatment effects. The extension we consider is given

   This equation includes a spatial lag of the treatment dummy (second term on the
right hand side) as well as spatial lags for post-treatment dummies (fourth term on
the right hand side). The coefficient φ measures the average direct treatment effect
(ADTE) and the coefficient δ multiplied by the average proportion of treated neighbors
measures the average indirect treatment effect (AITE), or the spillover effect of the flash
flood. In this case, the control group is composed of municipalities that are neither
directly nor indirectly treated (Delgado and Florax, 2015).
   The terms wij are elements of the spatial weight matrix W , which capture the
neighborly relationship between municipality i and municipality j. In the present
study, we use two types of spatial matrices: I) Binary Contiguity: wij takes the value
of 1 if i borders j and 0, otherwise; II) k-Nearest Neighbors: wij takes the value of 1
if j is one of the k-nearest neighbors of i and 0, otherwise.

                                   4. Variables and Data
   The data we use to investigate the direct and indirect effects of the 2008 flash flood on
the economic performance of the Santa Catarina municipalities consists of a balanced
panel for the years between 2006 and 2010. Since our study area is often affected by
natural disasters, we choose this small time interval to eliminate two less intense shocks
that might affect/confound our estimates. In 2004 for instance the southern Brazilian
states were hit by the “Catarina” hurricane, which affected about 40 municipalities in
the State of Santa Catarina and caused four deaths. In January 2011 another flash
flood occurred in the state and affected 83 cities and caused six deaths.

   Treatment definition. An important issue when estimating the effects of disasters
relates to the criteria used to define municipalities affected by the shock. A common
choice has been to use rainfall levels and their deviations from historic averages as a
measure of disaster exposure. As we argued in section 2, however, the 2008 flash floods
were characterized by a combination of heavy rain, flooding and landslides. Since
these floods and landslides were responsible for most of the damage, and these are not
perfectly predicted by rainfall variation within municipalities, using rainfall as proxy
for exposure may be inadequate. We choose therefore to use a more objective measure
of disaster exposure: areas declared under a state of public calamity. Accordingly,
the Brazilian Ministry of Integration establishes a few objective criteria that must be
satisfied for cities to declare a state of public calamity: I) 10 or more individuals killed,
or 100 individuals affected; II) 10 or more public health/education facilities destroyed;
and III) economic loss above 8.33% of the municipality’s net current revenue. Hence,
due to these strict criteria, we expect only municipalities that were heavily affected by
the floods to be considered as treated.
   Aside from those who declared a state of public calamity, a few municipalities ge-
ographically far from the most heavily affected region (northeastern state) declared
state of emergency. This is a milder signalling of a natural hazard, but more prone
to endogeneity since no objective criteria has to be satisfied for those who declare an
emergency status. There is in fact evidence that the recognition of emergency status by
the federal government is related to partisan position (political alignment) of the mu-
nicipality mayor (Cavalcanti, 2016), as a mechanism to facilitate federal transfers. In
that regard, we add political controls (as described below) to test for this heterogeneity
and perform sensitivity analysis. As a robustness exercise, we also define treatment
based on a measure of human damage; we consider treated municipalities as those who
had homeless or dead individuals.6
   Outcome and control variables. The dependent variable is the municipality GDP
per capita, constructed annually by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statis-
tics (IBGE). The choice of covariates was based on the empirical literature of regional
growth (Lall and Shalizi, 2003; LeSage and Fischer, 2008; Crescenzi and Rodríguez-
Pose, 2012). From IBGE we use data on population size, urbanization rates7 and the
share of agricultural and manufacturing sector on the GDP. We also include public
investment in capital as a proxy for physical capital investment, which is measured an-
nually by the Department of National Treasury (STN), subordinated to the Brazilian
Ministry of Finance. Related to urban infrastructure we use information on proportion
of households with access to piped water, access to electricity and garbage collec-
tion. These information are available annually by the primary care information system
(SIAB), from the Health Ministry.
   In addition to the socioeconomic variables that might determine our outcome vari-
able, we consider adding covariates related to local politics. Following Barone and
Mocetti (2014), we include election turnout as proxy for civic engagement, which is a
measure of institutional quality. In addition, as partisan alignment has been shown
to affect local growth (Novosad and Asher, 2016), we add two dummy variables that
link the political alignment between local and state (federal) governments. This vari-
able assumes value equal to 1 when the mayor and the governor (president) share the
same party and 0, otherwise. All political variables were obtained from the Brazilian
Electoral Superior Court (TSE).
6Thereare 25 municipalities matching this criterion.
7Asthe urban population size is only available for the years 2007 and 2010, values for the other years
were estimated via interpolation since it has a steady trend.

  In table 1 we present descriptive statistics for the variables used in our analysis.
We note that municipalities affected by the flash flood are richer when compared to
unaffected municipalities. Also, they present higher volume of public investment, better
urban infrastructure and are more industrialized.

                                          5. Results
   In this section we present the direct and indirect effects of the 2008 Santa Catarina’s
flash flood on GDP per capita of the affected municipalities. We also present the effects
taking into account the three economic sectors. At the end of the section we access the
spatial spillover effects on geographically linked regions.

5.1. Direct effects of the 2008 flash flood. Table 2 presents the direct effect es-
timates of the Santa Catarina flash flood on GDP of the affected municipalities. As
stated above, the empirical strategy consists in estimating the presence of short-run or
persistent effects on GDP of the affected units. Column (1) refers to the model with
time and municipality fixed effects, while in columns (2) and (3) we include socioeco-
nomic and political control variables, respectively.
   According to the column (1) the flash flood lead to an average fall of approximately
10% on GDP per capita in the year that municipalities were hit by the disaster. The
same intense and significant result was obtained when we look at the year succeeding
the flash flood. Only in 2010 the GDP per capita rebounded back to the patterns
observed for the non affected municipalities. These findings suggest the existence of
short-term negative effects on economic activity, with a quick recovery to pre-disaster
levels. This is along the lines of the “recovery to trend” hypothesis, also observed in
the recent cross-regional literature reported in Xiao et al. (2013); Husby et al. (2014);
Elliott et al. (2015); Tanaka (2015). Results are quantitatively the same when we
add socioeconomic controls in our main specification (column 2), and present marginal
changes when political controls are added (column 3). The reduction of the magnitude
of the damage observed in column (3) may indicate that the political alignment between
the executive power of the different entities of the federation can facilitate the reception

of transfers, political windfalls and donations, in line with the work of Cavalcanti
(2016).
   In order to capture any pre-trend differences between treated and control units, table
3 presents the results considering anticipatory effects, as depicted in equation 3.2. Here
we consider the specification with one lead and two lags time periods. Column 1 rep-
resents the model with time-fixed effect, municipality fixed-effects, and socioeconomic
control variables; and column 2 controls for political variables.
   For both specifications, the coefficients measuring anticipatory effects are not statisti-
cally significant. Put another way, one can argue that there is no significant differences
between the GDP trajectories for control and later affected municipalities. If there was
another unobserved factor leading to a drop in GDP per capita of the affected munic-
ipalities, then it would have contemporaneous effects to the same economies, which is
hardly credible. The lagged coefficients for 2009 and 2010 have the same pattern as
the results obtained in table 2.
   In table 4 we present the results of two robustness tests. In the first test we use as
alternative treatment status municipalities that suffered some human damage, defined
as rather homeless or dead people as consequence of the flood. This criterion is less
restrictive than the state of public calamity declaration and comprises a larger number
of affected municipalities. In the second robustness test, the control group is composed
by municipalities with similar observable characteristics as the affected ones (columns
3 and 4). The matching procedure consists in estimating the propensity score for each
municipality8 before the parametric estimation (Ho et al., 2007). To improve balance
between treated and control units, the matching estimation is useful to reduce the
model dependence, remove outliers and minimize potential selection bias.
   According to table 4, changes in treatment criteria and the composition of the control
group do not change the results for the year the flash flood occurred, even tough the

    For more details about this methodology, see Caliendo and Kopeinig (2008). We employ a nearest
    neighbour algorithm for the construction of a new control group, composed by 14 municipalities.

results are quantitatively smaller. Worth to note that the negative impact disappears
one year before the natural disaster took place (columns 3 and 4) mainly because the
sample size is drastically reduced after matching.
5.2. Heterogeneity by intensity of damage and by economic sectors. The use
of public calamity declaration as a proxy for disaster exposure may be tricky because it
does not reveal the intensity of the damage. Even if one knows weather the municipality
was affected by the disaster there is no a clear picture about the size of the damage.
An intuitive way to obtain some insights regarding the destruction level is creating an
alternative treatment group composed by those municipalities affected by the flood,
but at a lower magnitude than those that invoked for public calamity. As discussed in
section 4, when a natural event occurs in a particular region the local government can
claim for emergency or public calamity status. Thus, the use of the state of emergency
dummies in equation 3.1 as treatment status is a reasonable strategy to attain the
differences in shock intensity9. One can expect that municipalities that have enacted
state of emergency also suffer from the shock, but less intensively than those who
required for public calamity. Table 5 shows the results of this empirical exercise.

who enacted public calamity presented a drop of 9.66% (see column 2). It is worth
to note that the effect fades away immediately in the year following the disaster in
the case of emergency status. These evidences suggest the existence of heterogeneous
effects in the disaster exposure and the use of emergency and calamity status resemble
this fact.
   The results presented so far show that the 2008 flash flood intensively harmed the
economic activity of the affected municipalities. An important aspect for the design
of damage management policies and financial aid plans is to understand how these
effects spread out to different economic sectors. Although some quantitative research
is focused in measuring the economic impact of natural disasters on the economic
outcomes, little is known about their impact on distinct economic sectors. This gap in
literature avoids the development of better mechanisms to promote the reestablishment
of affect areas. In this sense, the shock affects the economic sectors in different ways and
to test this hypothesis we re-estimated equation 3.1 considering the GDP per capita
in different economic sectors: agriculture, manufacturing and services. Table 6 below
summarizes the results.

                 errors that were grouped at the municipal level. The standard deviations
                 are presented in parentheses. The dependent variable is the logarithm of
                 GDP per capita. We exclude the sharing of agriculture and manufacture
                 from the time-varying controls. Non-dichotomous control variables are in
                 logarithm format.


   All economic sectors are negatively affected by the natural disaster, although in
different magnitudes. The agricultural sector is the most damaged by the flash flood10.
In the year of the disaster, the agricultural GDP of the treated municipalities are
reduced on average by 19.49%. This figure is twice as large as the impact size on

10
     As the share of manufacturing and services in the economy of the damaged areas is much higher
     than the share of agriculture, the absolute impact of the disaster is greater in the first sectors.
     Considering the average GDP of the affected municipalities and the coefficients described in table 6,
     it’s estimated that the shock caused (per municipality) a reduction of R$ 3.71 million in agriculture,
     R$ 56.17 million in industry and R$ 49.7 million in services.
           NATURAL DISASTERS, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SPATIAL SPILLOVERS                                  15

manufacturing GDP, and approximately four times the size on GDP of the tertiary
sector.
  Due to the nature of the shock, this result is quite expected. The floods can destroy
completely the agricultural production systems, and it is almost impossible to protect
the farms and agriculture assets from shocks like this. As mentioned in introduction,
the study of Xiao et al. (2013), which investigated the economic consequences of a 1993
Midwest flood, also found that the impact on the agricultural sector were negative and
long-lasting. Additionally, this evidence is also consistent with the finding of a recent
report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2015), which
found that in developing countries, the agricultural sector absorbs about 22% of the
economic damage caused by natural disasters.


5.3. Spatial Spillovers. The evidence shown above reveal that the flash flood caused
a negative economic impact on the affected municipalities, but one may consider the
existence of spillover effect in neighbouring areas. Due to the regional linkage between
economic activity, it is feasible to expect that there is some spatial effects neglected
by the previous results. A particular region may be directly affected by the disaster
(when the event occurs in your own boundary) or may be affected indirectly (when
the event occurs in the vicinity of the region). Additionally, the SUTVA is unlikely to
hold in studies focused on the impact of disasters in a regional perspective. Following
the methodology proposed by Delgado and Florax (2015), table 7 shows the estimated
results from equation 3.3.
   Column (1), (2) and (3) show model specifications similar to those estimated in
section 5.1, while column (4) presents the specification that considers the spatial lags
of the covariates. This model is widely used in spatial econometric literature11 and is
known as SLX model (Halleck Vega and Elhorst, 2015).
   As can be observed, the results related to the direct impact remains unchanged
when compared to the benchmark specification (see table 2). However, there is some
evidences that a particular economy is also affected indirectly by the shock: the lags co-
efficients for the neighbour treatment variable are negative and statistically significant.
Thus, one year after the event, municipalities that have a neighbour affected by the
2008 flash flood showed a decline in its per capita GDP of about 1.4% (0.27x0.0526)12
and a contraction of 1.24% (0.2361x0.0526) two years after the event.These findings
reveal that the municipalities indirectly affected by the natural hazard did not suffer
the consequences immediately, only in years after the shock (2009 and 2010).
   There are two possibilities that may help explain this result. Firstly, the intensity of
economic interactions among directly affected and neighbouring areas can have some
degree of time seasonality. For example, such interactions may occur predominantly
in the early months of the year, so that in November 2008 (month that the flash flood
occurred), most of the interactions had already been materialized. Secondly, it is likely
that the economic effect of a demand drop for goods and services from the neighbours
only be felt with a certain degree of delay.

11
   Besides adding spatial lag in the covariates, another option would also include the spatial lag in the
   dependent variable, specification known as Spatial Durbin Model (SDM). However, the consideration
   of global spatial dependence on a difference-in-differences framework is still a developing point
   (Delgado and Florax, 2015).
12
   As discussed in section 3, the average indirect treatment effect (AITE) is measured as the multiplica-
   tion between the spatial lag coefficient and the respective average proportion of treated neighbours.
   Using the binary contiguity matrix, we observed this value is 0.0526 (Table 9).

   Finally, table A1 in the Appendix A shows that indirect impacts are insensitive to
specifications with different spatial matrices (k-Nearest Neighbor), indicating robust-
ness. Thus, the evidences showed in this section indicates that spillovers effects are far
from negligible and neglect them may lead to undermined results of the real economic
impacts of the natural disasters. Further, aid-relief policies should take into account
the potential indirect effects of natural disasters.

                              6. Concluding Remarks
   This paper access both direct and indirect effects caused by the flash flood that
occurred in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. In order to deal with the endogeneity
of the treatment definition of which municipalities were affected by the disaster we use
as objective criteria of disaster exposure those municipalities declared under a state of
emergency or public calamity status. We estimate contemporary and dynamic effects
of the flash flood on the economic performance of the affected areas. Also, we allow
the existence of spillover effects on unaffected but geographically related areas in the
state.
   We find that municipalities directly affected by the flash flood presented a significant
drop of 8.5% on GDP per capita immediately after the disaster and a decrease of 7.71%
in the year following. The economic performance of the municipalities rebounded to the
pre-disaster level only after two year. When considering different economic sectors we
observe that the agriculture sector does not present the same recovery pattern and has
more permanent consequences. The results for spatial spillover suggest that indirect
effects are far from negligible due the economic and social interactions between mu-
nicipalities. These results are particularly important for aid policies aimed to mitigate
overall loses, which also should consider the neighboring affected regions.

      Note: *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. We use robust standard errors that were grouped
     at the municipal level. The standard deviations are presented in parentheses. The dependent
     variable is the logarithm of GDP per capita. The time-varying controls are reported in table
     1. Non-dichotomous control variables are in logarithm format. We use the k-nearest neighbor
     matrix (weighted) in the estimations.
