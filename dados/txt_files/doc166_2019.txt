Abstract
The reversal of the increasing trend of crime in the state of São Paulo has raised interest to determine
its possible causes. Several factors have been suggested by literature to explain this great crime
decline. Our hypothesis is that the police productivity shock generated by INFOCRIM was the crucial
factor for explaining the decline. Thus, this work aims to evaluate the impact of INFOCRIM on crime
in the state of São Paulo. We adopted the synthetic control method to perform a case study of the
impact of INFOCRIM on homicide rates in the state of São Paulo. We compare outcomes under
INFOCRIM against a counterfactual of “state of São Paulo without INFOCRIM”. We estimated that
the homicide rate with INFOCRIM decreased 37 per cent in comparison to the homicide rate in the
synthetic São Paulo scenario without INFOCRIM.

Key words: Police productivity shock; synthetic control; INFOCRIM; homicide rate.

A inversão da tendência crescente do crime no estado de São Paulo despertou interesse em determinar

declínio do crime. A hipótese adotada é a de que o choque de produtividade da polícia gerado pelo
INFOCRIM foi o fator crucial para explicar o declínio. Assim, este trabalho tem como objetivo
avaliar o impacto do INFOCRIM no crime no estado de São Paulo. Para tanto, adotou-se o método
de controle sintético para realizar um estudo de caso do impacto do INFOCRIM nas taxas de
homicídio no estado de São Paulo. Comparou-se os resultados no INFOCRIM com um contrafactual
do “estado de São Paulo sem o INFOCRIM”. Estimou-se que a taxa de homicídios com INFOCRIM
diminuiu 37% em comparação com a taxa de homicídios no cenário sintético de São Paulo sem o
INFOCRIM.

1. Introduction
        Crime imposes immense social costs and negative externalities, representing the pernicious
effects on economic activity and the quality of people’s life (Lochner and Moretti, 2004). For
instance, the cost of violence in Brazil was estimated to be 5.9% of 2016 GDP (Anuário Brasileiro
da Segurança Pública, 2017). Obviously, the violence cost is high because the criminality rates are
high in Brazil, which concentrates 14% of all homicides in the world, thus being part of the top ten
of the violence ranking, according to Health World Organization (Waiselfsz, 2015).
        As reported in table 1, there is a clear uptrend in Brazil’s homicide rate over the years. In
1980, there were 10.8 homicides per one hundred thousand people in Brazil, whereas in 2014 the
homicide rate was already of 34.6. Over this period, crime in Brazil increased more than 220%.
        The regional distribution reveals that crime has spread out to all Brazilian macro-regions. In
the period of 1980 to 1999, all macro-regions faced an increase in homicide rates (table 1). Some
regions are above the Brazilian average, such as the Southeast (149%), the North (135%) and the
Central-West (151%), while other regions are below the Brazilian average, namely, the Northeast
(94%) and the South (60%). The leading Brazilian state in crime growth during this period was São
Paulo (220%), with a homicide rate of 44.1, higher than the Brazilian average (24.1). From 1999 to
2014, Brazil had a slowdown in crime growth, but even so, it faced an increase of 43%. In this period,
all regions, except the Southeast, showed an increase in their homicide rates. The negative highlight
was the crime growth in the Northeast region (160%).

        In contrast to this crime surge in Brazil, the homicide rate in the state of São Paulo,1 after a
skyrocketing trend, reversed this trend in 2000 by showing a sharp drop in incidence, returning to the
crime level of the early eighties, as in figure 1. There was a decline of almost 70% in the homicide
rate in the state of São Paulo, making it one of the three states with the lowest crime levels in the
country.2 This is the “Great Paulista Crime Decline Puzzle”. The reversal of criminality in São Paulo
was celebrated by the United Nations as a successful case, along with New York and Bogota.
        The fundamental question that arises is the following: while Brazil and the other states are
facing increasing criminality, what is the cause of this great crime decline in the state of São Paulo?
Such a great crime decline in the 2000s has motivated intense debate in the literature to try to address
this question. There are several competing hypotheses to explain it. Some hypotheses involve
nationally scoped policies and, while others involve policies that occurred only in São Paulo.

        As to national scoped events, there is a suggested hypothesis about the impact of Brazil’s gun
control laws on the crime decline in the state of São Paulo (Hartung, 2009; Cerqueira, 2010; Cerqueira
and Mello, 2012; Souza et al. 2007). 3 This hypothesis hinges on the argument of "less weapons, less
crimes". In Brazil, 88% of all homicides involve firearms. In this context, the argument is that fewer
circulating weapons would reduce crimes motivated by interpersonal conflict. Gun control laws have
increased the cost of carrying firearms, reducing their demand, alongside with the voluntary
devolution of firearms in exchange for money (buy-back). The hypothesis is that such a policy has
reduced the stock of firearms.4
        From an empirical approach, Cerqueira and Mello (2012) adopt a panel data model to estimate
the effect of guns on violent crimes and on property crime, using a proxy for the prevalence of
firearms (suicides committed with firearms divided by total of suicides) and using also an
instrumental variable for this proxy to correct endogeneity. The authors presented evidence that gun
control measures, operated in the state of São Paulo between 2001 and 2007, decreased violent
crimes. The problem with this explanation is that gun control laws were implemented throughout
Brazil after June 2004, but the study used only information from the state of São Paulo. If gun control
laws reduce crime, it must be valid for the entire national territory. The authors did not validate the
gun control laws hypothesis by expanding the study area for Brazil as a whole. In the guise of partial
validation, using information from all Brazilian federative units,5 we ran the first differences in
homicide rates between 2000 and 2010 (DHOMRATE) on the same proxy variable for prevalence of
firearms used by the authors, also in first differences (DSAF), in the same period. There is no
correlation between these variables.
        The soundest evidence on the impact of the buy-back program on crime is from Scorzafave et
al. (2015). The authors analyzed its impact on deaths, using a quasi-experimental study based on
matched difference-in-differences. The treatment group was composed by Paraná’s municipalities,

  According to Scorzafave et al (2015), only 3% of the stock of firearms in Brazil was withdrawn from circulation by the
buy-back campaign.

  Brazil is divided into 27 federative units, being 26 states and one federal district. The map with the Brazilian states and
federal district is in figure A.1 in the appendix. The list with names and initials of the Brazilian states and macro-regions
is in table A.1 in the appendix as well.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3
whereas the control group was composed by municipalities of other Brazilian states. No impact of
the buy-back program was found out at all.
         Another explanation given for the great crime decline is the demographic transition
experimented by Brazilian society (Mello and Schneider, 2010). The basic idea behind this hypothesis
is that young males aged fifteen to twenty-four are prone to commit offenses, representing a high-risk
age group in terms of involvement with offenses. Consequently, this demographic transition has
provoked the decline of the percentage of males between fifteen and twenty- four years old in the
population, which caused the reduction of crime. Once again, the validation test of this hypothesis
was not done using information from all levels of Brazilian society.
         By ways of partial validation, using information from all Brazilian federative units, we ran the
differences between homicide rates over the period of 2000-2010 (dhomrate) regarding the
differences of the group of young men aged 15-24 years for the same period (dcrimeage). The
correlation between these variables was not significant at the 10% level, casting doubt on the possible
causal link.
         Sixty-seven municipal police forces were created over the period of 1999-2014 in São Paulo
(Kahn and Zanetic, 2005). One might therefore conjecture that security policies at the municipal level
may have been responsible for reducing crime in São Paulo. However, there was also the creation of
municipal police forces throughout the country. Analyzing the implementation of municipal guards
only for the state of São Paulo, and using a fixed-effect model for the period 2004-2009, Ferreira et
al. (2016) found evidence of a drop in both the homicide rate and the robbery and theft rates due to
the impact of the implementation of municipal police forces. The problem is that the study did not
control for the regression of INFOCRIM, which is a technological information system similar to
COMPSTAT. In this sense, INFOCRIM is a confounding factor because it is correlated with the
implementation of municipal police forces and, at the same time, related to crime, thus overshadowing
the causal effect.
         In turn, Vital (2018) assessed the impact of this kind of policy on both homicide and vehicle
theft rates, but now controlling for INFOCRIM. The author did not find evidences that the creation
of municipal police forces had an impact on crime rates (homicide rates and vehicle theft rates) in
São Paulo or Brazil, ruling out that this hypothesis is valid to explain the “great Paulista crime
decline”. The absence of statistical significance lies in the fact that the assignment of municipal police
forces is intended by law to protect public property and not to fight crime. In fact, what causes the
decline of crime in São Paulo must be another factor that is missing in the estimation of the model,
operating exclusively in this state.
         As to policies that were just implemented in the state of São Paulo, dry law hypothesis is
regarded as a potential reason to explain the crime decline (Biderman et al, 2010; Kahn and Zanetic,
2005; Dualibi et al, 2007). Sixteen municipalities in São Paulo enacted dry laws that impose
compulsory closing hours for bars and restaurants from 11pm to 6am all week long (Biderman et al,
2010). The idea behind this hypothesis lies in the fact that dry laws restrain recreational alcohol
consumption and sales by imposing compulsory closing hours. The restriction of alcohol
consumption avoids the interpersonal confrontation that might lead to murders. There are two caveats
with this explanation, acknowledged by the authors themselves (Biderman et al, 2010). First, it is not
a general explanation since only 2.5% of the municipalities of the state adopted dry laws, therefore,
insufficient to have an impact on the whole state. Second, the timing of implementation of the dry
law does not match the onset of crime decline. All these cities implemented the dry law after 2001,
except one, while the criminal drop started in the state of São Paulo in 2000.
         Another explanation claims that there was a monopolization of crime in the prison system by
the PCC6 gang. The PCC Hypothesis would explain the reduction of crime by means of administering
justice and of the meditation of personal conflicts and the monopolization of drug trade (Biderman et

    The acronym PCC means “Primeiro Comando da Capital”, that is, “First Command of State’s Capital”.
                                                                                                        4
al, 2014). 7 Working with data from January 2005 to October 2009, Biderman et al (2014) found a
negative effect on crime in some slums in the metropolitan area of São Paulo. Once again, it is
noteworthy that the crime decline happened earlier. In addition, Justus et al (2016) dismantle this
hypothesis, arguing that there was a crime decline in most of the municipalities of the state of São
Paulo where there were no attacks by the PCC gang. Using a proxy for presence of the PCC gang,
the authors did not find out any effect of PCC on crime.
        The bottom line is that we are skeptical about the identification of the causal effect of these
hypotheses suggested by the literature to explain the great crime decline in São Paulo. The
aforementioned explanations suffer from three potential shortcomings. First, the timing of the
implementation of these policies (gun control laws, dry laws and the PCC hypothesis) does not match
the onset of the crime decline in São Paulo. Second, nationally scoped factors should be tested not
only for São Paulo, but also for Brazil as a whole in order to validate their causal link (gun control
laws, demographic transition and municipal police forces). Third, the majority of the studies did not
control for the INFOCRIM, the technology oriented to the public security, being this one kind of
confounding factor.
        Our alternative hypothesis is that the police productivity shock experienced in the State of São
Paulo, generated by INFOCRIM, was the crucial factor to explain its great crime decline. The causal
channel that explains the crime reduction is as follows: the adoption of INFOCRIM in 1999/2000
represented a police productivity shock, thereby increasing the probability of a criminal being
arrested. Consequently, there was a change in the behavior of potential criminals that reduced their
chance of committing offenses. We consider this hypothesis more plausible than the others because
the date of implementation of INFOCRIM matches the onset of the crime decline. In addition to, our
hypothesis involves a distinctive factor that only happened in São Paulo.
        In our empirical strategy, we investigate the hypothesis of a police productivity shock as the
main factor responsible for the great crime decline, using a synthetic control method. Our findings
indicate that the police productivity shock caused a drop in the homicide rate of around 37% in
comparison to what would have happened with the crime rates in São Paulo, if it had not experimented
this police productivity shock generated by the adoption of INFOCRIM.
        The organization of the paper is as follows. Next section describes the public security oriented
policy, INFOCRIM. The third section explains the empirical strategy adopted and the data set
compiled. The fourth section discusses the results, whereas the final part concludes.

2. Police Productivity Shock in the state of São Paulo
        We claim that the “great Paulista crime decline puzzle” is caused by the police productivity
shock in São Paulo. The policy that had the greatest impact on the increase of police efficiency in São
Paulo was the integrated technological information system, INFOCRIM, implemented when crime in
São Paulo reached its peak.
        From 1999 onward, the state of São Paulo began to invest heavily in technological systems
dedicated to fighting crime. This investment in technology at the service of public security has
intensified the efficiency of police operations, increasing the likelihood of potential criminals to be
arrested. This moment coincides with the onset of the reversal in the trajectory of the homicide rate
for the state of São Paulo in 2000.
        INFOCRIM is a technological crime tracking system, which is able to compile in online
databases the entire information about criminality in the state of São Paulo. This information system
is similar to COMPSTAT and includes the type of crime and the location of its occurrence on map.
This unified criminal data and intelligence system geocodes police reports, detecting crime spots and
allocating police forces to fight crime where and when it occurs.8 Besides, by transmitting crime
information in real-time and online, INFOCRIM allows coordinating police activities.

  Some studies use ethnographic evidence in favor of the crime reduction in geographic areas dominated by PCC gangs
(Dias, 2011; Willis, 2013 and 2015).
8
  Besides, INFOCRIM now includes FOTOCRIM, which is a photo database that contains prisoners’ photos.
                                                                                                                 5
        All police departments have online access to INFOCRIM and police officers on streets can
consult the system by means of computers installed on the vehicles. INFOCRIM has affected all
stages of fighting crime, whether at the stage of prevention, repression or further investigation of
crimes.
        An important step towards the implementation of INFOCRIM was the geocoding of police
reports, which started in the biennium of 1999-2000 in the city of São Paulo, since it had one of
highest crime rates in the state of São Paulo.9 From 2001 to 2003, INFOCRIM was taken to 38
municipalities that make up the metropolitan region of the city of São Paulo. These 39 cities
concentrate 54% of all homicides in the state. Over the period of 2003-2005, INFOCRIM was
implemented in five big cities in the countryside of São Paulo. In 2008, INFOCRIM was taken to
eighteen other cities. The spatial distribution of municipalities with INFOCRIM in 2008 is shown in
figure 2.
        Cabral (2016) carried out the only work in the literature that investigated the impact of
INFOCRIM on crime in São Paulo. By means of the variation of the data within the state of São Paulo
in a difference-in-differences approach, the main finding indicates that the municipalities that
received INFOCRIM had a lower homicide rate than the municipalities that were not contemplated
with the program.

        The result of this increase in police productivity in São Paulo is the crucial factor explaining
the large decline of approximately 70% in the homicide rate between 2000 and 2014. In addition, the
increase in police productivity also explains the reduction of crimes against property. Figure 3 shows
the downward trajectory of vehicle theft and vehicle robbery rates.10 In the period 2001-2014, the
vehicle theft and robbery rate fell, respectively, 51% and 55%. Extending the time interval to 2017,
the vehicle theft and robbery rate decreased, respectively, 63% and 73%.
        Therefore, our hypothesis is that INFOCRIM, a technological system at the service of public
security, has increased police productivity, raising the likelihood of criminals being arrested and
thereby reducing crime. Such an increase in police productivity was the distinguishing factor in
relation to the situation of the other states, which did not have this technological shock. Moreover,
the starting date of INFOCRIM (1999/2000) coincides with the beginning of the reversal of the crime
trend in São Paulo (2000).

3. Empirical Strategy
3.1. Construction of Synthetic Control
        In order to evaluate the impact on crime generated by the police productivity shock generated
by the adoption of INFOCRIM in São Paulo, it is necessary to compare the situation of this state after
the occurrence of the productivity shock with the situation that would prevail in the same state if there
had not been a productivity shock. Clearly, the last outcome is not observed. Therefore, such outcome
should be conjectured by building up a counterfactual for São Paulo in such a way that the only
difference between São Paulo and the control group would be the police productivity shock generated
by INFOCRIM.
        A way to build up a counterfactual is to make an experiment by randomly choosing a treatment
group and a control group. However, the difficulty for building up a controlled experiment in
economics is widely known. Most frequently, economists and social scientists have to use
observational data instead of sampling data, in order to assess a policy impact. Therefore, economists
endeavor to find some options in order to build up a quasi-experiment, which attempts to mimic a
random experiment (Cameron and Trivedi, 2005).
        First of all, one should notice the peculiarities of this particular quasi-experiment. We have
only one Brazilian state that has adopted INFOCRIM in our study. In addition, the set of untreated
regions that can make up the control group is limited to, at most, the other 26 federative units. Given
this quasi-experimental scenario, the lack of observations makes it unfeasible to adopt some of the
most popular approaches to implement impact assessment, such as differences-in-differences (DID)
and the data-panel approach estimated by the instrumental variables method.
        Alternatively, the synthetic control method is adopted in the literature for studying several
subjects when geocoded data are used (as for example, regions, census tracts, districts, planning areas,
counties, municipalities, states, countries, etc.). Such a method has proved to have several advantages
(Abadie and Garzeabadal, 2003; Abadie et al, 2010). For instance, an advantage of synthetic control
over differences-in-differences method rests on the fact that synthetic control takes into account non
observable idiosyncratic characteristics, both time invariant and time variant (Abadie et al, 2010). It
is noteworthy to remember that the differences-in-differences approach considers only these
characteristics invariant in time that are removed from the estimation by double differencing.
        In view of these advantages, the synthetic control was adopted for the elaboration of the
counterfactual by seeking a synthetic trajectory of the homicide rate to the state of São Paulo. The
creation of a control group aims to synthesize the trajectory of counterfactual result for this particular
region, using information from similar regions. The basic goal is that the synthetic São Paulo should
accurately resemble the trajectory of the homicide rate of the actual São Paulo. To do so, we used a
data-driven procedure to choose control groups in order to reduce the discretion of this choice.
        The synthetic group is formed by a weighted average of potential other states that do not suffer
the same treatment. There are two elements in this creation of synthetic control, namely, choice of
control states and the choice of weights of the states in the computation of the weighted average.
Weights are chosen to minimize the difference between the previous level of the homicide rate for
the synthetic São Paulo and the previous level of the homicide rate for the actual São Paulo. Besides,
these weights on each state in the control group are constrained to be non-negative and their sum
equals one.11
        For the same reason, the choice of control states was made with the purpose of having similar
characteristics to the state of São Paulo. This similarity hinges on the homicide rate and its predictors
grounded by theoretical concerns. In our case, the predictors used here are based on crime literature
(Becker, 1968; Ehrlicht, 1977; Kelly, 2000).
        The basic assumption of identification is that the synthetic São Paulo accurately reproduces
what would happen to the actual São Paulo, if that state had not implemented INFOCRIM.
Nonetheless, there are other identification challenges. A problem often overlooked is the violation of
the assumption of no interference between units (Rosenbaum, 2007). The explicit assumption of

                                                                                                        8
synthetic control is that the assumption of no interference between units is valid. There are two
possibilities that may violate this assumption in our study. First, other states may have been influenced
by INFOCRIM implemented in São Paulo and may have imitated it. Therefore, we should exclude
all those states from the donor pool utilized to construct the synthetic control. Second, this assumption
can be violated in the presence of spatial displacement of crime. If this does occur, the police
productivity shock in São Paulo will contaminate its contiguous neighbors. The way to handle this
kind of contamination within the synthetic control approach is also to eliminate these neighbors from
the donor pool.

3.2. Data and Sample
        In this study, we adopted annual state-level panel data for the period of 1980-2014 for the
state of São Paulo and for other states that belong the donor pool. As INFOCRIM was implemented
in 1999, there are 14 years before the intervention under study. Due to the lack of information for our
outcome variable (homicide rate) prior to 1988, we removed Tocantins from the donor pool.
        In Brazil, no other state had adopted a public security oriented technology quite like
INFOCRIM. Notwithstanding, some states adopted other innovative public security policies, such as
Rio de Janeiro with Peaceful Police Units , Minas Gerais with “Fica-Vivo” (Stay Alive) and Olho
Vivo, Ceará with community policing policy, and, finally, Pernambuco with the "Pact for Life".
Including these states in the pool donor could contaminate the synthetic control group, thereby
mitigating the effect of police productivity shock in São Paulo. Therefore, as exposed previously,
these states were excluded from the donor pool.
        One must be aware that Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul are
neighbors to the São Paulo State. If there has been a spatial displacement of crime, such an effect
could have contaminated the Synthetic São Paulo, which would attenuate the effect of productivity
shock on crime. Thus, we excluded these neighboring states in the donor pool as well.
        Consequently, the potential donor pool to elaborate the synthetic São Paulo is composed of
19 states. Since none of these potential control states has been treated, the synthetic control group
should be independent of the direct effects of the treatment.
        Our outcome variable is homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants. This proxy for crime was
chosen because the under-reporting is low. Besides, this crime information has been available to all
Brazilian states for several years since 1980. The homicide data come from DataSus, which is a
database of the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
        The variables used as predictors for the construction of synthetic control were income per
capita, poverty rate, education, population density, income inequality and serially lagged homicide
rates (1998, 1990, 1985 and 1980). More information on these variables is reported in table 3.

4. Results
       To evaluate the impact of the police productivity shock on crime, it is necessary to build up a
control group to furnish a counterfactual if São Paulo had not had such a shock. Figure 4 shows the
increasing temporal trajectory of the homicide rate of the other states in comparison with São Paulo.
One perceives that it would not be appropriate to use this control group to do the counterfactual since
the parallel-trend assumption is not met.

        In order to be regarded as a good counterfactual, a control group requires that its observable
and non-observable characteristics must be similar, on average, to the State of São Paulo. Table 4
reports the means of the predictors used in the implementation of the synthetic control. As can be
observed, the synthetic group for the state of São Paulo displays averages for these predictors close
in magnitude, except for income and density.

        When implementing the synthetic control, five donor states received weights greater than zero
to form the control group for the State of São Paulo, namely Rondônia (0.340), Amapá (0.406),
Alagoas (0.032), Espírito Santo (0.092) and Mato Grosso (0.129). This weighting structure points out
that the homicide rate trend in São Paulo is best represented by a weighted average of these states.
        Figure 5 depicts our assumption of identification, tracing the trajectories of the actual São
Paulo and the synthetic São Paulo for the homicide rate. Looking at this figure, at first we verify that
the synthetic series behaved as a good counterfactual, since it predicted adequately the homicide rate
in the absence of INFOCRIM. This is confirmed by the root mean square prediction error (RMSPE)
of synthetic series in comparison with the original series. During the pre-treatment period, the
RMSPE value was 1.46, considered a very good fit for the homicide rate in São Paulo prior to
INFOCRIM.

        The homicide rate trends for the Synthetic São Paulo and the actual São Paulo are parallel
until approximately 1999. During the period of 2000-2003, there is a detachment in this trend. In
contrast, after 2003, the synthetic trajectory was above the trajectory of the series for actual São Paulo.
Thus, one concludes that the police productivity shock of the state of São Paulo was able to reduce
homicide rates considerably.

                                                                                                        11
         In addition to the graphical analysis, it is possible to calculate the average effect of the police
productivity shock on crime. To do so, one must calculate the ratio between the actual and the
synthetic homicide rates. Afterwards, the average is calculated for the periods subsequent to the
treatment. Our results indicate that for the entire 2000-2014 period, the homicide rate had a decline
of 36.9%.
         In order to check the falsification of the results, three placebo tests were performed. In the
first placebo test, we applied the synthetic control to estimate the impact of INFOCRIM in São Paulo
to every state in the donor pool. In each placebo run one control state is considered as treated in 1999
(that is, adopting INFOCRIM), shifting São Paulo to the donor pool. The idea is to check if the gap
in Figure 5 was created by factors other than INFOCRIM (Abadie et al, 2010).
         The purpose of the test was to check if the difference for the treated state of São Paulo
generates some different behavior when compared to the differences of the other non-treated states.
If the effect of São Paulo is located at the extremities of figure 6, there is statistical significance of
the police productivity shock generated by INFOCRIM. Figure 6 depicts the results of this placebo
test. The gray lines stand for the gap related to each placebo run, displaying the difference in homicide
rate between each state in the donor pool and its synthetic control. Similarly, the red line describes
the gap in homicide rate estimated for São Paulo. As can be observed in figure 6, the line representing
the gap in homicide rate for São Paulo starts to be located at the lower end of the distribution of the
gaps for states in the donor pool, denoting the statistical significance of the impact of the police
productivity shock.

        In turn, the second test stands for a temporal placebo. The intuitive idea behind this test was
to check if the effect found in 1999 is not spurious. To do so, new synthetic series was generated with
pretreatment periods set back in five years (1994). Even with the new pretreatment period, our
expectation was that there would be no changes in the point where the synthetic and treated series
                                                                                                         12
actually separated. The synthetic trajectory constructed by figure 7 followed the trajectory of the
treated series, similar to the results of figure 5. This means that the pre-shock period receded in time
to 1994 did not alter the previous results.

        At last, we checked the robustness when the assumption of no interference between units was
relaxed. Therefore, we included the neighbors of São Paulo, as well as the states that implemented
innovative security policies in the donor pool. We got then a new synthetic control, which is
composed of 21.0% Rondônia (RO), 13.5% Amapá (AP), 14.0% Pernambuco (PE), 2.3% Alagoas
(AL), 14.2% Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), 14.9% Mato Grosso (MT) and 20.1% Distrito Federal (DF).
It is noteworthy that the synthetic control had then a state that implemented an innovative security
policy (PE) and another state (MS), which is neighbor of São Paulo, violating, thereby, the assumption
of no interference between units. Figure 8 depicts the homicide rate trajectories for the actual São
Paulo and for the synthetic São Paulo, but now allowing an enlarged donor pool with 25 potential
control states. Our result indicates a decline in crime of 37.4%, which is very similar to the result
obtained with a synthetic control without neighbors and states that adopted innovative security
policies. Thus, our results seem to be robust.

5. Final Remarks
         The article evaluated the impact on crime of the police productivity shock generated by the
adoption of INFOCRIM in the state of São Paulo. Our findings indicate a decline in crime of
approximately 37% compared to the state of São Paulo's crime trajectory, had it not had this
productivity shock. Therefore, we consider that the police productivity shock was the crucial factor
to explain the great Paulista crime decline and to solve the puzzle.
         In the end, this article has two messages: one pessimistic and another optimistic. The
pessimistic message is that crime in Brazil has spread over the last fifteen years, practically
throughout the country, with an increasing trend, except for the state of São Paulo. The optimistic one
is that all other Brazilian states may also reduce their crime rates by adopting a public security policy
similar to INFOCRIM.
