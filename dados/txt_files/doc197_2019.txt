There is evidence of a relationship between in utero exposure to catastrophic events and adverse
birth outcomes, usually attributed to heightened maternal stress. The objective of our work
was to evaluate if the breakage of a dam containing waste from a mining cite in Brazil, in 2015,
an event popularly known as the Mariana Tragedy, affected the health of newborns exposed in
utero. We used administrative data on birth records and reports on the Mariana Tragedy to
identify all births from newborns exposed in utero and the intensity of that exposure, according
to the mother’s municipality of residence. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we esti-
mated the impact of different intensities of exposure on birth outcomes. We found that being
directly exposed in utero to the Tragedy resulted in 1.86 days shorter gestational age and 2.6
percentage points higher incidence of preterm birth (< 37 weeks). We found no impact on birth-
weight related outcomes. The effect is larger than previously identified for other catastrophic
events. We hypothesize that this is probably due to the Tragedy impacting birth outcomes not
exclusively through heightened maternal stress, but also through depressed economic activity
in directly affected municipalities.

1         Introduction
1.1         Catastrophic events, stress and neonatal health
The relevance of the prenatal environment for fetal development and its long-lasting conse-
quences has attracted attention not only from the biomedical sciences, but also from economics
and public health (Almond and Currie 2011; Almond, Currie, and Duque 2018; Gluckman et al.
2008). In relation to this, an important line of research is the relationship between maternal
exposure to stress during pregnancy and neonatal health. Bussières et al. (2015) identify dif-
ferent forms used in the literature to measure and conceptualize maternal stress, among them
the exposure to natural disasters or other catastrophic events.
     The main hypothesized mechanism to explain the relationship between prenatal maternal
stress and health at birth is the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis). When a
pregnant woman is exposed to stress, the HPA axis is activated and heightens the levels of cor-
tisol, which in turn leads to higher levels of placental corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH).
Increased levels of CRH are associated with decreased fetal growth and pre-term delivery (Bei-
jers, Buitelaar, and Weerth 2014; Wadhwa et al. 2004). Even though this mechanism is widely
accepted as relevant, it is possible that heightened maternal stress during pregnancy affects
birth outcomes also through other mechanisms, like a depressed immune system, which in-
creases the risk of inflammatory reactions that might lead to pre-term birth (Beijers, Buitelaar,
and Weerth 2014; Dunkel Schetter 2011). Also, higher stress levels might lead to prejudicial
habits or health behaviors, like smoking or drinking alcohol, which could also be prejudicial for
the newborn (Beijers, Buitelaar, and Weerth 2014; Dunkel Schetter 2011; Dunkel-Schetter and
Lobel 2012).
     Maternal exposure to stress during pregnancy may also have long-lasting effects. Some
studies have found evidence that health at birth –measured by birthweight or gestational age-
is positively correlated with cognitive development, educational outcomes and income in adult
life (Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2007; Figlio et al. 2014; Moster, Lie, and Markestad 2008).
There is also evidence of longer lasting effects of stress during pregnancy on children health and
educational attainment, independently of any manifestation at birth (Aizer, Stroud, and Buka
2016; King et al. 2012).
     A frequently studied source of maternal stress is exposure to natural disasters or other kinds
of catastrophic events. Following the definition of the United Nation Agency for Disaster Risk
Reduction (UNISDR), a disaster can be defined as: “A serious disruption of the functioning of
a community or a society at any scale due to hazardous events interacting with conditions of
exposure, vulnerability and capacity, leading to one or more of the following: human, material,
economic and environmental losses and impacts”1 . Defining “crisis” in a similar fashion, Vogl
and Bharadwaj (2015) highlight three relevant criterions for an event to be defined as such: it
must be acute –meaning not long-lasting-, severe –meaning a large shock that profoundly affects
an area- and unexpected –difficult to anticipate by individuals-.
     A limitation of studies on the impact of in utero exposure to catastrophic events on neonatal
health is that it is frequently not possible to directly measure maternal stress levels. In those
cases, it is difficult to discard other possible causal channels through which disasters could affect
health at birth. Specifically, if a large disaster disrupts economic activity, it might generate
income reduction or job loss, which in turn could affect birth outcomes. In the literature about
the impact of economic downturns on birth outcomes (Bozzoli and Quintana-Domeque 2014;
Margerison-Zilko, Li, and Luo 2017; Olafsson 2016; Wehby, Gimenez, and López-Camelo 2017)
two mechanisms are discussed. On the one hand, financial insecurity might increase maternal
stress, which can lead to the same effects described above. On the other hand, there might be
an income effect that leads to the reduction in the consumption of health-enhancing products,

mainly a nutritionally healthy diet.
     In utero exposure to disasters and related stress have been measured in different forms.
Some studies have directly measured stress levels of pregnant women exposed to disasters,
either by measuring their levels of cortisol or by applying standardized questionnaires. Other
studies have solely considered exposure to a natural disaster or other kind of catastrophic event
as given by the pregnant women place of residence (Harville, Xiong, and Buekens 2010). The
first kind of studies (King et al. 2012; Tan et al. 2009; Xiong et al. 2008) can directly assess
stress levels and therefore discard other potential mechanisms through which in utero exposure
to disasters could be harmful for neonatal health. However, the second kind of studies (Bozzoli
and Quintana-Domeque 2014; Camacho 2008; Currie and Rossin-Slater 2013; Eskenazi et al.
2007; Kim, Carruthers, and Harris 2017; Quintana-Domeque and Ródenas-Serrano 2017; Tong,
Zotti, and Hsia 2011; Torche 2011; Torche and Shwed 2015) usually work with administrative
data on whole populations, which gives them an advantage in terms of the unbiasedness and
size of the samples they work with. That allows them to make stronger causal claims about
the effects of exposure to disasters on neonatal health but makes it difficult to disentangle the
precise transmission mechanisms.
     The kind of disasters considered in the reviewed studies can be grouped in two different
kinds: natural disasters and acute armed violence. Quintana-Domeque and Ródenas-Serrano
(2017) analyzed the impact of exposure during pregnancy to a terrorist attack in the mother’s
province of residence in Spain between 1980 and 2003. Using a database of birth registries in
Israel between 2003 and 2009 that includes individual identifiers for the mother, Torche and
Shwed (2015) exploited the outburst of the 2006 Second Lebanon War as a natural experiment
to assess the effect of prenatal exposure to stress in Israel. Eskenazi et al. (2007) analyzed birth
outcomes in New York City and upstate New York before and after the terrorist attack of 11
September 20012 . All three studies used administrative data on birth records and their results
pointed similar directions. Both Quintana-Domeque and Ródenas-Serrano (2017) and Torche
and Shwed (2015) found that exposure to armed violence was related with lower birthweight and
a higher prevalence of low birth weight when it occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy.
Torche and Shwed (ibid.) additionally report a negative effect on the duration of pregnancy
when exposure happened in any of the first two trimesters. Eskenazi et al. (2007) found that
exposure to the stress associated with the events of September 11, 2001, in New York, were
associated with increases in low-birth weight when exposure was during the first or second
trimester of pregnancy.
     Studies on the effects of fetal exposure to natural disasters have focused either in earthquakes
(Kim, Carruthers, and Harris 2017; Tan et al. 2009; Torche 2011) or different kind of storms:
hurricanes (Currie and Rossin-Slater 2013), floods (Tong, Zotti, and Hsia 2011), and ice storms
(King et al. 2012). The most relevant to us are the ones that make use of large datasets
of administrative data on birth records, like our database. Currie and Rossin-Slater (2013)
analyzed the impact of in utero exposure to hurricanes in Texas, USA, between 1996 and 2008,
using a mother-fixed-effect model. They found no robust evidence of an impact on birthweight
or gestational age but did find robust effects of disaster exposure during the third trimester on
the probability of being born with an abnormal condition that originates in the perinatal period
(e.g. meconium aspiration syndrome or assisted ventilation).
     Torche (2011) evaluates the effects of the 2005 earthquake in Tarapaca, Chile, as a source of
maternal stress on birth outcomes and finds a significant effect on birthweight, gestational age
(both negative) and the probability of being born premature (positive), when exposed in utero
during the first trimester in the region where the earthquake was more intense. Kim, Carruthers,
   2
     The authors exclude all records from births close to the place where the World Trade Center was to
exclude cases in which there was exposure to the toxic dust cloud. Currie and Schwandt (2016) analyze
fetal exposure to the dust and link their results to the existing literature on the effects of air pollution
on neonatal health.

and Harris (2017) did a similar exercise with the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles,
California, in the USA and found a positive, albeit little, effect on the probability of being
born with low birthweight. These last two works rely on the unexpected and acute character
of the earthquakes to exploit them as natural experiments, using a difference-in-differences
methodology.
    The objective of our work is to evaluate if the breakage of a dam containing waste from a
mining cite in Brazil, in 2015, affected the health of newborns exposed in utero. This event
had similar characteristics to other disasters: it was a large shock with a considerable impact
on a circumscribable geographical area and was mostly unexpected to residents. However, an
interesting difference is that while earthquakes and hurricanes are natural disasters, the Mariana
Tragedy was an environmental disaster whose occurrence was responsibility of human actions,
and, thus, potentially preventable. The occurrence of a similar disaster involving a tailing dam
in the same region in January 2019 highlights the relevance of assessing every possible impact
of those events.
    Even though there is consensus about the prejudicial effects of exposure to catastrophic
events during pregnancy, there is still debate on the most vulnerable periods of the gestational
process and the specific birth outcomes affected. Also, considering that the event occurred in
a middle-income country, with high poverty rates and low access to care in some regions, the
effect of disasters is expectedly higher, because measures aimed at buffering the consequences
of exposure are presumably weaker.


1.2    The Mariana Tragedy
On November 5, 2015, a dam containing mining waste from the Samarco mining company
in Bento Rodrigues, a district of the Mariana municipality in Minas Gerais, a southeastern
Brazilian state, had a breakage. Consequently, a mudflow containing mining waste advanced on
parts of four different municipalities, all in Minas Gerais: Mariana, Barra Longa, Rio Doce, and
Santa Cruz do Escalvado. The mudflow reached also the Rio Doce river and spread through its
waters for approximately 600 kilometers, affecting 34 other municipalities (31 in Minas Gerais
and 3 in Espı́rito Santo, a neighboring state). Due to the magnitude of the event and the extent
of the damages, it remained popularly known as the Mariana Tragedy.
    The report made by the task force organized by the government of Minas Gerais to assess the
consequences of the dam breakage divides its effects according to two different regions: the four
municipalities directly hit by the mudflow and the remaining municipalities, mainly affected by
the pollution of the Rio Doce watercourse (Grupo da Força Tarefa 2016).
    In the four municipalities directly affected, the mudflow caused 19 deaths and 256 injured
people. In addition, over 600 people lost their house and 280 suffered related illnesses. Consid-
ering also other consequences (e.g. interruption of electricity and water supply, of health care
and educational services, and destruction of physical infrastructure), 10,482 residents of those
four municipalities were considered to have been directly impacted (ibid.).
    In the municipalities affected by the pollution of the Rio Doce, the immediate consequences
were linked to restrictions in the availability and quality of water. In 14 municipalities water
supply was suspended due to the presence of toxic waste or turbidity above tolerable levels.
This did not only temporally impact water for human consumption but also agriculture, fishing,
tourism, and celluloid production, i.e., economic activities relevant for the region (Fernandes
et al. 2016; Grupo da Força Tarefa 2016).

2       Methods
2.1     Data
In order to assess the effect of in utero exposure on birth outcomes , we used the microdata
from the SINASC-DATASUS, the System of Information on Life Births from the Department
of Informatics of the Unified Health System, i.e., the Brazilian National Health Service. As
registration is compulsory and there is near total compliance, the system includes the universe
of births in Brazil. Each observation corresponds to one live birth and provides information on
the pregnancy, newborn, and mother characteristics. Additionally, we used data from the SIM-
DATASUS, the System of Information on Mortality, that includes data from all death records,
including fetal deaths, to estimate fetal mortality rates3 .
    We first selected all births between 2013 and 2016 in the two states affected by the Mariana
Tragedy: Minas Gerais and Espı́rito Santo. Further, we dropped all multiple births (2.4% of
total observations), because the interpretation of indicators of neonatal health is different for
those cases, and births that occurred outside hospitals (0.5%), in which recorded information
is presumably less accurate (n = 1,231,567 births).
    To avoid any potential selection problems that could arise from reproductive decisions being
affected by exposure to the Mariana Tragedy, we limited our sample to births that occurred
until July 2016, i.e. the ninth month since the dam breakage. We further dropped all births
prior to August 2013 to have 3 full years of data (n = 914,795).
    We then collapsed all birth data by municipality of residence of the mother and month and
year of birth and constructed a panel with birth data from all municipalities from the states of
Minas Gerais and Espı́rito Santo. We also estimated the count of fetal deaths by municipality
of residence of the pregnant women and added that data to our panel. Our final database
consists of a panel of 36 birth cohorts (from August 2013 to July 2016) in 931 municipalities
and includes data from live births and fetal deaths.
    We used data from reports on the consequences of the Tragedy (Grupo da Força Tarefa,
2016) that identify all 38 municipalities directly or indirectly affected: 35 in Minas Gerais -four
directly and 31 indirectly- and three in Espı́rito Santo –all indirectly. We added binary variables
indicating if the municipality of residence of the mother was directly or indirectly affected. As
the Tragedy might have had an economic impact in some neighboring municipalities (Cavalcante
Simonato et al, 2018), we added a third binary variable for municipalities that pertain to the
same microregion4 as a directly or indirectly affected one and might have been potentially
affected. Figure 1 shows the location of affected municipalities, differentiating by the intensity
of exposure to the Tragedy.

2.1.1    Dependent variables
We used data on the following birth outcomes: mean birthweight (in grams), mean gestational
age (in weeks), proportion of low birthweight births (LBW, under 2500 grams), and proportion
of preterm births (PTB, less than 37 weeks of gestation). As it is possible that injuries in utero
result in miscarriages, we used two different measures to check for this: proportion of male
births5 and fetal deaths rate (fetal deaths per 1000 potential births, i.e. live births plus fetal
deaths). We also checked if exposure to the Mariana Tragedy affected the number of births, as
    3
     All data from SINASC/DATASUS and SIM/DATASUS is open access and is available in:

13/08/2018).

     The micro-regions were geographical areas defined by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics until 2017 for the elaboration of statistical information.
   5
     There is evidence of a link between stress inducing events and a decline in the proportion of male
births, due to selective fetal loss (Catalano and Bruckner 2006; Catalano, Bruckner, et al. 2006).

a way of measuring attrition due to migration.

2.1.2    Explanatory variables
We identified all births in affected and neighboring municipalities between November 2015
(the month of the dam breakage) and July 2016 (the ninth month). We considered three
different levels of in utero exposure intensity. We adopted the classification of official reports
and considered birth in those months in municipalities reached by the mudflow as directly
affected and in municipalities near the Rio Doce as indirectly affected. We also considered
births in those months in proximate municipalities (defined as those in the same microrregion
as a directly or indirectly affected one) as potentially affected because we cannot discard that
psychological or material effects of the Tragedy were not felt in neighboring cities. We therefore
had three binary variables indicating if the newborn was potentially, indirectly or directly in
utero affected by the consequences of the dam breakage. Additionally, we differentiated the
timing of the exposure to identify if the specific gestational trimester of exposure was relevant.

2.1.3    Covariates
In the base specification of our difference-in-differences model, we included fixed effects for
municipality of residence, for each month-and-year of birth -i.e., for the 36 birth cohorts-, for
calendar month of birth, and a municipality-specific linear trend. In additional specifications, we
added state-specific year fixed effects and/or maternal characteristics (i.e., percentage of mothers
under 20 years old, percentage of black and brown mothers, percentage of single mothers and
percentage of mothers with up to 7 years of education).


2.2     Estimation Strategy
To estimate the impact of the Mariana Tragedy on health at birth, we used a difference-in-
differences framework. We estimated regressions of the following form (model 1):

         ycmt = α + β1 directly af f ectedcmt + β2 indirectly af f ectedcmt
                                                                                                (1)
                   + β3 potentially af f ectedcmt + γc + λmt + ηm + ϕ T rendcmt + εcmt

Where ycmt is one of the dependent variables described above in municipality c, in month m,
and year t. directly af f ectedcmt indicates cohorts of newborns in municipalities reached by
the mudflow between November 2015 and July 2016. indirectly af f ectedcmt indicates cohorts
of newborns in municipalities next to the Rio Doce between November 2015 and July 2016.
potentially af f ectedcmt indicates cohorts of newborns in that period in municipalities proxi-
mate to directly or indirectly affected ones. γc is a municipality fixed effect, λmt is a cohort
(i.e, month-and-year of birth) fixed effect, ηm is a calendar-month fixed effect to control for sea-
sonality and T rendcmt is a municipality-specific time trend to allow for possible differences in
pre-exposure trends. In additional specifications, we added state-specific year fixed effects. For
regressions with birth outcomes as dependent variables, we also added maternal characteristics
as covariates.
     We also assessed the impact of the different levels of exposure to the Mariana Tragedy on
birth outcomes according to the gestational trimester of exposure, estimating regressions of the

                     G=1

In all cases, robust standard errors were clustered at the municipality level to account for serial
correlation and all regressions were estimated by least squares, weighted by the municipality
average monthly number of births during the whole period.


3     Results
Table 1 shows summary statistics from all birth records grouped by the intensity of exposure
to the Tragedy for the whole period (August 2013 - July 2016). The directly affected region
is comparatively small, and comprises only one municipality with sizable population, Mariana,
which had 58,802 inhabitants in 2015, i.e. 81% of the directly affected population. The indirectly
affected region is considerably bigger and includes two cities with over 250,000 inhabitants in
2015: Ipatinga and Governador Valadares.
    Considering the whole period, the incidence of LBW and PTB is lower in the indirectly
and directly affected regions when compared to unaffected and potentially affected ones. Mean
birthweight and gestational age are also higher. Maternal characteristics also differ among un-
affected and affected regions. In unaffected municipalities there are proportionally less mothers
with less than 8 years of schooling, but more single mothers, than in indirectly or directly
affected municipalities. In directly affected municipalities, the proportion of teenage mothers
is smaller and in indirectly affected municipalities the fraction of black and brown mothers is
smaller than in all other regions.
    Table 2 shows the results of estimating model 1 for four different birth outcomes: birthweight
(in grams), gestational age (in weeks), and proportion of the newborns with LBW and PTB.
For each dependent variable, the first column shows the results for our base model, the second
column for the model adding maternal characteristics and the third column for the model adding
also state-specific year fixed effects.
    The results show that in utero exposure to the Mariana Tragedy in directly affected munic-
ipalities resulted in shorter pregnancies and a higher incidence of preterm births. Considering
our base model, being directly exposed in utero to the Tragedy resulted in 1.86 days shorter
mean gestational age and, more importantly, 2.6 percentage points higher incidence of preterm
birth . Those results are robust to the inclusion of maternal characteristics and state-specific
year fixed effects as additional controls in our regression, and in all cases significant at the 1%
level. In utero exposure in those municipalities did not have a significant impact neither on
mean birthweight nor on the incidence of LBW, although it is worth noting that the sign of the
coefficient for LBW is opposite to the expected one for directly and indirectly affected cohorts.
    A potential problem when estimating the impact of in utero exposure to some phenomena
on birth outcomes is attrition in the affected cohorts. There is evidence that stressful conditions
during pregnancy lead to fetal loss, and that they disproportionately affect male fetus. If that
were the case in our study, we would have attenuation bias, because there would be missing
newborns whose birth outcomes would be presumably worse. To check for this, we used two
different measures: fetal deaths rate (number of fetal deaths per 1000 potential births) and the
proportion of male births. An additional source of attrition could be maternal migration. If
pregnant women residing in affected municipalities moved to other cities as a response to the
Tragedy and after delivery the new city was recorded in birth certificates as the city of residence,

                                                    7
we would expect the number of births in affected municipalities to decrease -and the number of
births could in turn also be affected by fetal losses.
    To check for the existence of those different forms of attrition, we estimated model 1 with
number of births, fetal deaths rate and proportion of male births as dependent variables. Table
3 shows the results of our estimations. In all cases, we estimated both our base model and
a model including state-specific year fixed effects. According to our results, there is evidence
that in utero exposure to the Tragedy in indirectly affected municipalities -i.e., municipalities
that are next to the Rio Doce but were not reached by the mudflow- led to miscarriages. In
those municipalities, the Tragedy resulted in an increase of 4.2 fetal deaths per month per 1000
potential births (live births plus fetal deaths). However, as we did not find any effect on the
number of births or the proportion of male births, these results should be taken with caution
because fetal deaths are likely underreported and reporting rates might not be uniform among
municipalities. In potentially and directly affected municipalities, we found no impact of the
Mariana Tragedy on the number of births, fetal deaths rate or the proportion of male newborns.
We interpret these results as a sign of absence of in utero selection and attrition due to maternal
migration.
    We further analyzed the relevance of the timing of in utero exposure to the Mariana Tragedy.
We focused exclusively on gestational age and the incidence of PTB, the two outcomes for which
we found an impact considering the whole gestation. The results are shown in table 4. We
estimated the same three models as in table 2: our base model and models including state-
specific year fixed effects and maternal characteristics. We found that in utero exposure during
all gestational trimesters in directly affected municipalities significantly altered gestational age
and the incidence of PTB, and the impact was larger when exposure was during the first
trimester. Focusing on PTB as outcome and our base model (column 4), we found an impact of
3.6 p.p. on the incidence of PTB among the cohorts exposed during the first trimester. During
the second and third trimester the impact was 2.1 and 2.5 percentage points, respectively.
    Finally, we realized a series of robustness checks. We focused on PTB because it is the
most interesting outcome, as it is the one associated with medical complications early in life
and educational outcomes and income in adult life (Behrman and Butler 2007; Moster, Lie,
and Markestad 2008). The results are shown in table 5. Columns 1 to 3 shows the results of
running the same regressions as in columns 10 to 12 of table 2 but restricting the sample to
municipalities in the state of Minas Gerais (where all directly affected municipalities are). This
implied changing the composition of the control group by dropping all observations from the
state of Espı́rito Santo. The coefficients for the impact of in utero exposure to the Mariana
Tragedy on the incidence of PTB remain basically unchanged when compared to the ones in
table 2. Columns 4 and 5 show the results of regressions ran directly from the microdata,
without constructing the panel of municipalities, both including and not including maternal
characteristics as covariates. The coefficients are somewhat smaller than in table 2 but point
in the same direction and remain significant at the 1% threshold.
    Additionally, as is common practice when applying the difference in differences methodology,
we realized placebo tests. We first dropped all observations posterior to July 2015 and estimated
the impact as if the Mariana Tragedy had occurred in November 2014 (column 6 of table 5).
We did not find any impact of this mock Tragedy. Our second placebo, depicted in column 7,
was a lead -i.e. we tested if there was an impact in the 9 months before it actually happened.
Again, the coefficient for the fake exposure was non-significant, which adds credibility to our
results.
    Finally, Column 8 shows the results of adopting as interest variable the interaction between
the binary variables indicating the level of in utero exposure and the proximity to the geo-
graphical location of the broken dam, measured by the inverse of the distance in kilometers
from the geographical center of the city. The impact among newborns exposed in directly af-
fected municipalities is similar to the one without considering the distance. For the municipality


                                                 8
of Mariana, with a center located 19.72 kilometers of the dam and where most directly exposed
cases are, the 0.525 coefficient implies a 2.7 p.p. increase in the percentage of children born
premature, similar to the effect we had previously found. Taken together, all these robustness
checks increase our confidence in the estimated impact of the Mariana Tragedy on prematurity.


4     Discussion
We found a significant and large impact of in utero exposure to the Mariana Tragedy in directly
affected municipalities on mean gestational age at birth and the proportion of preterm newborns.
Considering our base model, exposure in those municipalities resulted in gestations around
1.9 days shorter (0.266 weeks) and a 2.64 percentage points higher proportion of premature
newborns. The impact was larger among those exposed in the first three months of gestation
(2.79 days shorter gestation and a 3.64 p.p. increase in the proportion of premature babies)
than in the second (1.99 days and 2.11 p.p.) or in the third (1.25 days and 2.51 p.p.). These
results were robust to the inclusion of different covariates, to the restriction of our sample to
births only in the most affected state, and to the use of microdata instead of a panel of data
aggregated at the municipality level.
    Even though we cannot completely discard migration of pregnant women as a result of
exposure to the Tragedy, which seems likely in directly affected municipalities, we found no
effect on the number of births, which gives us confidence in our results not being completely
driven by endogenous migration. Additionally, we found no evidence of in utero selection due to
fetal deaths in directly affected municipalities. We found an increase of fetal deaths in indirectly
affected ones. Even though this result should be interpreted with caution due to problems with
reporting of fetal deaths, it could mean that we underestimated the effect in those municipalities
if more fragile fetus died in utero.
    The results found are in line with previous studies indicating negative impacts of unexpected
natural disasters on neonatal health. In our case, we only found those effects for weeks of
gestation and preterm delivery, and notably larger in magnitude. Of the two studies most
similar to ours, Torche (2011) and Kim, Carruthers, and Harris (2017), only the first one found
an effect of in utero exposure to a disaster on gestational age and prematurity. In cities were
the intensity of the analyzed earthquake was high, Torche (2011) found a 0.188 weeks reduction
in gestational age and a 2.6 percentage points increased probability of being born premature
among newborns affected in utero during the first trimester. She found no impact among those
exposed in later trimesters. Additionally, in the context of exposure to acute armed violence,
Torche and Shwed (2015) found a reduction of 0.099 weeks of gestation when exposed during
the first trimester and of 0.095 when exposed during the second trimester of gestation.
    The main limitation of our study, shared by many analyses on the impact of large-scale
catastrophic events on neonatal health, is that we cannot directly test for the main hypothesized
causal mechanism -i.e., that exposure heightens maternal stress levels, which in turn affects birth
outcomes. We showed the existence of an association between in utero exposure to the Mariana
Tragedy in highly affected municipalities and worse neonatal health, i.e. a higher proportion of
premature births. However, it is not possible to state that the causal channel goes exclusively
through heightened maternal stress.
    In fact, it is possible that the higher effect found, when compared to exposure to other
natural and non-natural disasters, is due to the presence of more than one channel linking
exposure to the Tragedy and birth outcomes. According to the official report of the government
of Minas Gerais (the state in which all four directly affected municipalities are located), the
event did not only cause direct human harm, but had also a significant impact on infrastructure
and disrupted economic activity. A study based on simulations using a computable general
equilibrium model (Cavalcante Simonato, Domingues, and Souza Magalhães 2018) estimated
a decrease in private consumption between 1.22% and 1.74% due to the Tragedy in Mariana,

                                                 9
the most affected municipality and where 87.4% of newborns directly affected were born. Even
though that is an estimation based on a simulation, and we cannot extrapolate it directly to
pregnant women, the magnitude of the impact of the event in directly affected municipalities
makes it unlikely that the effect on birth outcomes goes exclusively through heightened maternal
stress level due to exposure to the dam breakage. Disruption of local economic activity can be
an additional source of maternal stress, but it might also have a negative impact on personal
income and reduce the consumption of health-enhancing products. It is therefore likely that
our estimates reflect both stress-related and not stress-related channels through which exposure
led to worsened birth outcomes.
    Despite the difficulties in identifying the causal channel, the magnitude of the association
between exposure to the Mariana Tragedy and preterm birth highlights the necessity of designing
and implementing interventions focused on pregnant women during natural or environmental
disasters. Preterm infants are more likely to develop complications early in life (e.g., respiratory
conditions, a compromised immune system, cardiovascular disorders), which leads to an increase
in the need of medical care services and higher neonatal (under 28 days) and infant (under 1 year)
mortality rates (Behrman and Butler 2007; Moster, Lie, and Markestad 2008). Additionally,
preterm birth has been associated with lower wages and educational levels in adult life (Moster,
Lie, and Markestad 2008).


5     Conclusion
We showed that the breakage of a tailings dam in Southeastern Brazil was related with shorter
pregnancies and an increase in the proportion of preterm births (< 37 weeks of gestational age)
for newborns exposed in utero in municipalities directly affected -i.e, reached by the mudflow.
Our results are robust to different model specifications and in line with previous findings about
the impacts of catastrophic events on neonatal health but considerably larger, possibly due to
the combination of stress-related and not stress-related channels through which exposure led to
worsened birth outcomes.

     Note: robust standard errors clustered at the municipality level between parentheses. Columns 1 to 3 include only municipalities in the state
     of Minas Gerais. Columns 4 and 5 include results from microdata (each birth is one observation) instead of the panel of municipalities. In
     column 6 the interest variable is a placebo Tragedy in November 2014. In column 7, we have both our original interest variables and a lead
     (a placebo Tragedy 9 months before the real one). In column 8, our interest variable are the original ones interacted with the inverse of the
     distance between the geographical center of the municipality and the broken mining dam. All regressions include municipality of residence of
     the mother and month-and-year fixed effects, as well as municipality-specific linear trends. PTB: preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation). When
     considered in panel models, maternal characteristics are the proportion of mothers: younger than 20 years old, black or brown, less than 8 years
     of education, single. When considered in models with microdata are binary variables indicating the age (younger than 20, 20 to 24, 25 to 34,
     35 or older), education (less than 8 years, 8 to 11 years, 12 years or more, ignored), race (black, brown, white, indigenous, Asian, ignored), and
     marital status (single, married, divorced, widow, consensual union, ignored).* p-value < 0.1, ** p-value < 0.05, *** p-value < 0.01.
