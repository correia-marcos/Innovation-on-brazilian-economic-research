Abstract

   Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, known as SEANICs (South East Asian Newly Industrialized
Countries), were initially specialized in primary exports but within a short period of time they succeeded
in achieving extensive export and productive diversification towards manufacturing. These countries had
registered rapid growth of GDP and per capita GDP between 1980 e 2010, and had passed through
remarkable structural change in their economies. The objective of this paper is to analyze the
development paths of SEANICs, investigating its main source of economic growth, especially related to
the regional economic integration. Although the usual developmental literature emphasize the importance
of manufacturing export diversification to generate high growth rates and to allow technological catch up,
SEANICs’ cases demonstrate that this is not necessarily true. These processes were experienced in a
small scale, so manufacture development did not guarantee the overcoming of structural heterogeneity
nor of technological catch-up.

Resumo
Indonésia, Malásia e Tailândia, conhecidas como SEANICs (Países Recentemente Industrializados do
Sudeste Asiático), tiveram economias inicialmente especializadas em exportações primárias, mas que
dentro de um curto período de tempo conseguiram alcançar extensa exportação e diversificação produtiva
na indústria de transformação. Estes países registraram um rápido crescimento do PIB e do PIB per capita
entre 1980 e 201, e passou por uma mudança estrutural notável em suas economias. O objetivo deste
trabalho é analisar as trajetórias de desenvolvimento dos SEANICs, investigando sua principal fonte de
crescimento econômico, especialmente relacionada à integração econômica regional. Embora a literatura
desenvolvimentista costume enfatizar a importância da diversificação das exportações e da de produção
para gerar altas taxas de crescimento e recuperar o atraso tecnológico, o estudo de caso dos SEANICs
demonstrar que isso não é necessariamente verdade. Estes processos foram experimentados em pequena
escala, de modo desenvolvimento que o desenvolvimento industrial não tenha garantido a superação da
heterogeneidade estrutural tampouco o catch-up tecnológico.

From export specialization in natural resources to diversification in manufacturing: the
development strategies of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since 1980

Introduction
   Since the end of Bretton Woods the world’s eyes are turned to the Asian region, stage of the major
recent cases of fast and great economic growths witnessed in the globe. After the robust rise of Japan in
the post-war period, the Asian “Tigers” or NICs (Newly Industrialized Countries: Korea, Taiwan, Honk
Kong and Singapore) and later the Asian “Dragons” or SEANICs (South East Asian NICs: Indonesia,
Malaysia and Thailand)3 experienced a tremendous structural change in their trade and productive profiles
towards manufacturing. Many analysts studied their development paths, trying to identify the roots of the
expansion. Assuredly the concomitant growth of so many countries in one single same region cannot be
understood without a regional perspective. The most known one is the “flying geese” framework put
originally by Akamatsu (1962), in which Japan is the leader goose that diversifies its production and trade
towards higher value-added activities that are exported to third countries, and import from the followers
geese (Asian economies) primary products and low value-added manufacturing. However, the original
flying geese theory fits only to the vertical case of linear development (YOKOKAWA, 2012), so some
authors prefer the expression “bamboo capitalism” to name the horizontal modeling of regional economic
integration (XING, 2007). Despite their important contributions both approaches are limited for
considering only the role of supply factors on the process of productive diversification of production,
therefore as its discussed in the next section, demand dimension must be included in this analytical
scheme for understanding SEANICs’ high growth rates.
    SEANICS have been being a space of dispute that deserves special attention because -, differently
than NICs and Japan - Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are resource-abundant and energy provider
economies that had diversified towards manufacturing, apparently neglecting initial comparative
advantages. To some extent their economic growths also contradicts the literature that considers natural
resources (NR) a curse (SACHS & WARNER, 1995). Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in the eighties
were specialized in primary exports but within a short period of time succeeded in achieving extensive
export and productive diversification. These countries had experienced rapid growth of GDP and per
capita GDP between 1980 e 2010, respectively with annual averages of 5.4% and 4.0% in Indonesia,
6.0% and 2.7% in Malaysia, and 5.6% and 3.4% in Thailand (WDI, 2011). Manufacturing value added in
SEANICs has annually grown 8% in average in the same period. It is clear that this sector has pushed
SEANICs’ expressive rates of growth and a remarkable structural change towards manufacturing.
However, and contrary to what occurred to the NICs, the rise of South East Asian Tigers’ share in world
manufacturing exports has not been accompanied by an analogous rise in its share of world income. In
spite of their per capita income have doubled between 1980 and 2010, those nations remain out of the
ranking of the top sixty countries in terms of personal income (in dollars, according to WDI (2011)).
   In the early eighties Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were highly centralized military States, 4 under
heavy influence of the U.S. and Japan. SEANICs States had to deal with complex tasks of late
industrialization, particularly related to foreign capital and demand dependence. They implemented
development plans5 that essentially allowed the attraction of foreign direct investments of multinational
companies and the empowerment of domestic industrial groups in some economic activities. Japan has
been playing an important role on these development paths, not only due to its foreign direct investment
or as an importer of SEANICs’ exports, but also politically – mainly as a leader of their regional
integration in the international value chains and financial flows, in a dynamic where the US have been
being the consumer of last resource. Since the beginning of the last decade, China is becoming a big

  The inaugural fragile democracy in Indonesia reverted to a military regime after the coup of General Sukarno in 1959,
pursued by another coup of General Suharto in 1967, who remained head of state until 1999. The current Malaysia State was
formed in 1965 (after the separation of Singapore), ruled by the Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad for 21 years between
1981-2003. In Thailand, dictatorships began prior to WWII and lasted until 1988, and there was another State coup in 2006.

and Thailand as a final or for processing exports .
        The objective of this paper is to critically analyze the development paths of SEANICs, showing its
evolution and contradictions. The analysis particularly investigates the role of regional integration in the
promotion of structural change both in exports and production of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, from
a macroeconomic perspective. Traditionally, the literature on Asian development discusses whether the
reasons for the economic development were “pro-market” (related to financial and trade opening, and
“less State”) or “nationalistic” (related to industrial policy and protectionism; “more State”). Here this
dichotomy is avoided because their economic regimes were hybrid, i.e. both phenomena occurred in the
three countries under study in different degrees and temporalities, 6 but accommodating external trends
towards globalization.
        First section of the paper presents the dynamics of trade and productive integration of SEANICs,
emphasizing the contribution of macroeconomic regime – especially the exchange rate – and of foreign
direct investment. Second section examines foreign trade and it describes the process of manufacturing
diversification related to the engagement in global values chains (GVC), led by Japanese industrial
conglomerates. Final notes summarize main contributions of the paper.


    1) The dynamics of productive integration and the macroeconomic regime

   Let us understand the dynamic of the demand related to the rapid GDP growth in SEANICs. Their high
rates of economic growth between 1980 and 2010 are closely related to export growth (see Charts 1 to 3).
Due to greater integration in the value chains of the electronics industry, both Malaysia and Thailand have
their rates of GDP and investment growth more correlated to the rate of exports growth. As Table A10
shows, the investment to GDP ratio recorded higher levels in Thailand, reaching a maximum rate of 44%
in average from 1990 to 1994. Despite the crisis, SEANICs registered the highest investment rates in the
nineties, above 30%. But there was a significant reduction in the share of investment in GDP in the 2000s.
Consumption has lost relative importance vis-à-vis other demand components during the eighties and the
nineties in the three countries, but then it started to grow again in the 2000s in Indonesia and Malaysia –
reaching 50% and 58% of GDP share in the second half of the decade. Thus, in the current decade the
decline of investment share was compensated replaced by consumption in these two countries. According
to Jetin (2012) the main mechanism that triggered the increase in domestic consumption was the strong
expansion of formal employment, in spite of low wages, which also grew. Similarly, government
spending lost share in GDP from 1980 to 1999 in SEANICs but increased slightly in the 2000s, mainly in
Malaysia (13% of GDP).
   The most impressive structural changes took place in foreign trade, mainly in Malaysia and Thailand.
In Malaysia, exports expanded uninterruptedly from a level of 50% of GDP between 1980 and 1984 to
nearly 120% between 2005 and 2009. The rise in the export share in GDP in Thailand was also amazing:
from 20% to 70% of the GDP at the same period. By its turn, Indonesian exports have fallen between
1980 and 1984 because of the drop in oil exports, thus it stayed at a level of 40% of GDP until a new rise
in the end of the period pulled by natural resources. Analogously imports grew at a fast rate, very close to
that of exports in Indonesia and Malaysia, and even higher in the case of Thailand. Therefore net exports
of these countries were small or negative between 1980 and 2009. This was due to the strong process of
industrialization through import substitution and also to the way of integration into global value chains,
which was importing intermediate goods to re-export low value-added manufacturing goods.
   Impressive rates of export growth were followed by high growth rates of imports too, but except in
Thailand before the 1997 crisis, in general these countries had surplus in trade in goods (Table 1). Until
the financial crisis the surplus in net exports helped to alleviate, though not solved, the deficit in current
account – which was generalized in this period in SEANICs. This means that the balance of services plus

 Whilst SEANICs were consolidating their independence process and reorganizing their primary-exporting economies, Japan,
Korea and NICs attracted large inflows of productive and financial investments of the great powers, leveraging their economy
before the rest of the region.

royalties, profit and yields remittances were causing a leak in foreign exchanges until the 2000s.
Differently, in the last decade, the surplus in trade balance grew tremendously, enabling also positive
current accounts. The huge Chinese demand of raw material and other traditional exports seemed to play
an important contribution for this change.

   The importance of public investment in SEANIC’s gross fixed capital formation is remarkable. It
corresponded to almost half of the total in Malaysia more recently, and 25% in Thailand (see Table A3 in
the Annex). Another remarkable characteristic is the importance of foreign firms in private investment. In
terms of external contribution, the well-known great inflow of FDI7 in SEANICs happened in different
magnitudes due to a combination of domestic and foreign features. Net inflow of FDI in Indonesia was in
average below to 1% of GDP between 1980 and 2004, but from 2005 to 2009 it more than doubled (Table
A9 in the Annex). In Thailand the average ratio of FDI to GDP was 2.4%, noting that between 2005 and
2009 it reached almost 4%. Malaysia was the biggest main net FDI attractor is SEANICs, registering as
average ratio of 4% in the whole period and a peak of 7% between 1990 and 1995. One first important

  According to data from WDI (2011), Malaysia achieved a net FDI inflow of US$ 1 billion per year in the early eighties,
reaching more than US$ 8 billion in 2008. In Indonesia, FDI rose from US$ 100 million to more than US$ 9 billion, and in
Thailand from less than US$ 200 million to US$ 8.5 billion in the same period. The inflow of FDI in Malaysia is prior to 1980,
which explains its high average share of 1.7% in world FDI net inflows in the world in 1980-1984. This share shrank to less
than 0.5% by 1988/1989, then returned to expand and reached 3% in 1992. Since then Malaysian share at world’s net FDI
inflow retracted and stabilized at 0.4%. The share of Thailand in world net FDI inflow reached the maximum of 1.2% also in
1992. After 1993, it fluctuated a lot and it had a decline between 2004 and 2009. Indonesia’s peak in global FDI was 1.6% in
1996. Thai crisis and the political destabilization had dramatic consequences for FDI in Indonesia, which recorded negative net
entry between 1997 and 2003. Then the share of global FDI in Indonesia increased again and reached 0.5% in 2008.
                                                                                                                                                   3
domestic determinant for these high rates of FDI in SEANICs is industrial policy.8 Developmental plans
were designed and policies were done to attract foreign firms, for example, the set of export-processing
zones (EPZ),9 tax exemptions, export subsidies, and so on (see RASIAH 2003 for an extensive list of
industrial policies). Those policies took advantage of initial conditions – another crucial internal factor -
that enabled low costs of production, like the availability of cheap labor, energy and raw materials.
Nevertheless, SEANICS had much less sophisticated and effective industrial policy compared to NICs,
what accounts, “in no small way, for the very important differences in industrial and technological
capabilities between Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia” (JOMO, 2002, p. 10). And finally, the
macroeconomic regime also played an important role, such as will be discussed ahead in this section.10
   The source of FDI in SEANICs last decade was mostly Asian: 61% in Indonesia, 33% in Malaysia and
66% in Thailand, according to Thomsen, Otsuka, Lee (2011) as it is presented in graph 4. IMF data
exhibits that only in 2010, 25% of the FDI in Indonesia came from Singapore, followed by Netherlands,
USA, Malaysia and Japan. In Malaysia, main foreign direct investors were Singapore, Japan, USA,
Netherlands and the UK. Meanwhile, the FDI in Thailand was mostly Japanese, followed by Singapore,
USA, Netherlands and China.

   There were geopolitical and economic external factors that contributed to leverage FDI in SEANICs.

economic external factors are related to trade and investment regional dynamics. The economic

   Many types of State interventions were done to attract FDI, such as relaxing restrictions on equity ownership, provision of
infrastructure etc. But those countries “performed differently in the face of common opportunities for FDI-led industrial
change. Malaysia has fostered rapid upgrading in the technological content of foreign manufacturing, but Malaysian-owned
industry has remained marginal in most manufacturing industries. Thailand has failed to attract higher technology FDI, but has
preserved a modest role for Thai industrial enterprises” (JOMO, 2002, p. 14). By its turn, Indonesia engaged lately to the Asian
FDI circuit and it shows a patter worse than Thais in terms of technological deepening in the industrialization process (HADIZ
& ROBINSON, 2004).

   Which currently are insignificant, accounting for 5% of total Indonesian exports and less than 1% in other SEANICs, but
almost 50% of Chinese exports (OECD / WTO, 2013a).

   One of the key reasons for high FDI investment in Malaysia is political: the government gave incentives to FDI in order to
reduce the power of Chinese groups in the domestic economy (JOMO, 2003).

   Geopolitical ones are related to the strategic position of these countries in the Pacific Ocean, just in between powerful
economic and political territories as China, Japan, India and Russia (and former ex-Union of Socialist Soviet Republics). This
region is historically disputed by the “Great Powers” aiming to control maritime routes related to the profitable West-East
trade. Along the History, Japan made many incursions to these regions. Last de facto Japanese domination was during the II
World War. The USA guaranteed the political independence of SEANICs after the war, but since then Americans try to
influence the regional through military, political and economic means. After the War of Vietnam, the USA widened its
influence in the region, settling some naval and military basis – especially in Thailand (CAMBRIDGE, 1992). Xing (2007)
argues that US long-term strategic interest in East Asia has the dual objective of “watching” the role of Japan and “managing”
the risk of the rise of China as a global and regional power. The author also affirm that in face of Chinese and Japanese
imperialist interests, the US role and presence in this region as a balance-of-power guarantor are generally welcome by the
smaller nations.

integration was definitely fostered by the Plaza Agreement12 in 1985, which mayor consequence for Japan
was the devaluation of yen exchange rate against US dollar (46% in one year, according to IMF 2010).
Another important factor was the end of the preferential investment relationship between US and Japan
(which was established after the war). In parallel, China had started a gradual market opening after Deng
Xiaoping’s reform in 1979, starting a process of industrial catch-up. Malaysia and Thailand furthered
their progressive processes of exporting manufactures to OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development), of becoming a market for Japanese exports and investments13 and, in the last decade,
of raw materials provider for China. These movements constitute the basic framework of the “flying
geese” framework.
   Traditionally the dynamics of the regional integration in Asia involved three elements: 1) a leader
goose (Japan) that increases its exports by advancing into new manufacturing sectors that present the
highest growth rates in world markets and the stronger multiplier effect onto the domestic economy;14 2)
consumer markets outside the group of geese (US and Europe), 3) and the latecomers geese (like
SEANICs) - which now occupy the open spaces left by the leader goose in large consumer markets of
lower value-added manufacturing products.15 Evolving trade patterns are accompanied by new financial
dynamics, where financial and commercial centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan were set to
address aggressive strategies of investment inter and intra countries of the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN). SEANICs initially were outside the core of this dynamic, but after the Plaza
Agreement they were incorporated into the regional investment cluster intra-industry and intra-firm trade
– and so Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and lately Jakarta progressively became financial hubs. The regional
integration brought about high rate of growth in South and East Asia through a dynamics in which the
trade surplus with US provided the necessary foreign exchange to finance the trade deficit with Japan and
the growth of others aggregate demand components, especially the investment, led by expansive domestic
policies.
   However since the nineties the Asian vertical “flying-geese” model is shifting to a horizontal model of
regional economic integration, in which the new pattern of FDI inflow constitutes a complex productive
and trade network called “bamboo capitalism” or “parallel development” (CHEOW, 2004 apud XING,
2007, p. 14). The distinguishing characteristic of this system is the more complex trade of parts,
components and other intermediate products – but also of services related to the supply chain and intra-
firm tasks and activities - related to global value chains (GVC) and with China16 at its core (OCDE/
WTO, 2013a).17 Such a change requires greater governmental cooperation and institutional building, so

   The Plaza Accord was held at the Plaza Hotel in New York. Germany, USA, France, Japan and the UK agreed a combined
valuation of their currencies against U.S. dollar (BERNAND & RAVENHILL, 1995).
13
   This move is part of the world economy’s restructuring, of the resumption of USA hegemony and of the intensification of
global competition polarized between the countries of the Triad (USA, EU and Japan). Previously based on an essentially
national export strategy, when Japan was pressured to keep an unfavorable exchange rate policy, the country has deepened and
has developed a strategy of productive internationalization to Eastern and Southern Asia. So there was the hollowing-out of
manufacturing sectors to the Asian region through the increase in FDI promoted by Japanese conglomerates. Similar
phenomena is being led also by Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (MEDEIROS, 1997).

   “Japan was among the countries that most rapidly bottomed out from the serious structural crisis in the 1970s. Japan adopted
the first strategy to shift leading industries to new dynamic industries and followed linear development path. Japan had been
the most backward country among the catching-up countries in the golden age. When it lost dynamic comparative advantage in
the heavy and chemical industries, it was able to shift towards more sophisticated machinery industry, such as automobiles and
electrical machinery, from the mid-1970s onwards” (YOKOKAWA, 2012, p. 17)
15
   “When the Japanese economy entered a higher development stage focusing on high-tech industries and high value-added
products, it transferred its labour intensive and part of its capital- and technology-intensive manufacturing industries to other
East Asian countries, thus leaving itself at the far end in the spectrum of manufacturing and strengthening the character as a
service-oriented economy. Following the rapid economic development of the first generation of East Asian NIEs and the rise
of their labour cost, they too transferred their labour-intensive and part of its capital- and technology-intensive industries to
countries of Southeast Asia” (XING, 2007, p. 10).

   Another peculiarity is the intrinsic nature of the business of hundreds of ethnic Chinese family business and networks
connecting and interlocking, medium-sized businesses in many countries in the region. (XING, 2007).

   Actually, the higher integration of activities happened within supply chains, expanding trade processing. This phenomenon
was especially strong in electronics industry, which achieved a very modularized process of production that became a
benchmark to other sectors and activities too.
                                                                                                                               5
this is closely related to the proliferation of preferential trade agreements in Asia,18 as a part of the global
phenomena called “spaghetti bowl” (WTO, 2011). A coordinated macroeconomic regime is another
important tool of the current Asian regional integration, especially the exchange rate.
   Actually, since the Plaza Accord the dynamic of investment/ exports/ and imports relies on a consistent
macroeconomic regime, especially a stable undervalued currency against the dollar and the yen (Figures 5
and 6). This contributed for the trade surplus achieved that was notwithstanding derived from huge US
demand and the Japanese investment. But the devalued exchange rate could not avoid financial transfers
from SEANICs to the rest of the world. Examining their current accounts (Annex Table A4), it is clear
that Indonesia and Thailand recorded negative balances from 1980 to 2000. At least Indonesia could
maintain positive trade balances, while Thailand had negative net exports between 1980 and 1994.
Malaysia has shown deficits in current transactions only between 1980-1984 and 1990-1994, with a
robust positive trade balance. Throughout the eighties, the pattern of funding of these countries became
more speculative, what together with the deregulation of capital accounts, was one of the main roots of
the crisis in 1997 such as argues Jomo (2002). Moreover the rise of Chinese labor-intensive
manufacturing exports partially offset these countries at end-user markets. In all SEANICs, especially in
Thailand, the external debt along the nineties became mostly private (JOMO, 1998; ARESTIS, 2003),
resulted from over-investment in unmarketable external funds that exacerbated the current account
deficits, and increased the dependence of the industrialization to foreign capital.19 The over-indebtedness
was derived both in the demand side and supply side. In the first case, it was motivated by more
deregulated financial schemes (MCKINNON & PILL, 1998; FOLEY, 2003); in the second one, it was
provoked by the international liquidity and the financial liberalization of the nineties that made easy to
private sectors of developing economies to borrow money abroad (MEDEIROS, 2009). So essentially, the
largest short-term debt triggered by the financial liberalization process - especially after 1995, in a
scenario of yen and dollar’s devaluation, plus a highly undervalued yuan - generated progressive
speculative attacks on the exchange rate of the Southeast Asian countries, particularly Thai bath.

   In 2013 there were more than 300 PTAs in force. Although smaller in number, the agreements in Asia present the wider
rhythm of expansion since 2000 is. Asian trade has the largest value comparing to other regions in the world, and the
importance of intra-regional trade is also relatively big (it grew from 42% to 52 % between 1999 and 2009). Japanese exports
alone to the region rose from 31% to 54% in the same period (WTO, 2011).

   Due to high capital requirements probably limited the development and entrepreneurship of domestic business, as well as
other local capabilities. Further the foreign exchange surplus generated by export activities was reallocated for the payment of
financial obligations, instead of being invested in productive assets. Thus, the final effect of over-indebtedness and over
foreign investment was a domestic investment lower than the potential.
                                                                                                                                             6
the yen in the first half of the 2000s. Crisis’ effects have been different in scope and depth in the three
countries. Malaysia faced minor consequences,20 while Indonesia and Thailand dealt with inflation,
unemployment and worse poverty rates (DONER, 2009). Politically, the crisis led to the change of first
Thai Prime Minister and the fall of Dictator Suharto in Indonesia, after more than thirty years in power.
Thai and Indonesian governments resorted to loans from the IMF and other financial institutions
(including Malaysian) in order to get fiscal and debt relief. Therefore they had to implement some
economic measures required by the Fund. Nevertheless, in 1998 they were practicing countercyclical
policies to lower interest rates,21 the intensification of capital controls (GALA, 2007), expansion of
budget deficits, the designation of economic funds to save the financial system and social security
programs.
   In the second half of the 2000s, Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai exchange rates were kept devalued
against yen, and showed a soft valuation trend in relation to US dollar. In parallel, it must be
acknowledged that since 1997 the yuan is floating very along to the US dollar, what means that in spite its
undervalued level China’s currency have had real valuation in relation to SEANICs currencies. This
contributed to the resumption of the external sector, which heavily weighed for the recovery of these
economies in the 2000s, notwithstanding the contribution of macroeconomic policies. As discussed in the
following section from the crisis until 2009, SEANICs presented current account surpluses, thanks to the
recovery in exports stimulated by the rise of China.
   Macroeconomic recovery of SEANICS in the 2000s is related not only to the rise of commodities’
prices and to the persistent expansion of Chinese economy and her hungry demand, but also to the reset of
the FDI in the region. As it was seen, FDI in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand came especially from
Asia, notably, Singapore and Japan. It is notable the share of the Netherlands and USA as well, higher
than China’s. Though yet China is not so important in terms of FDI in the SEANICs, she is acquiring a
major role in trade. Actually, China is shaking the geese model due to her fly into many different
manufacturing activities,22 from low to high technological intensities,23 and her multiple chain production
and labour relations with many countries (XING, 2007).

     2) From trade specialization in natural resources to manufacturing diversification

   In the first half of the eighties, almost 95% of Indonesian exports were natural resources (NR).
Currently, NR represent about half of the total and manufactures the other half, especially textiles and
clothing, machinery and transport equipment and chemicals (WTO, 2011). Between 1980 and 1984, 76%
of Malaysian exports was concentrated in primary products from agriculture, forestry - mainly rubber -
and mineral ores., but at the end of the nineties it fell to 21%. The growth of manufacturing in this decade

20
   One of the reasons for Malaysian resistance to the crisis was the prudential regulation established after a banking crisis in the
late eighties, which involved new barriers to capital entry and exit (JOMO, 2003). Secondly, the government reduced taxes,
especially income tax over firms. This measure contributed to the attraction of foreign firms to relocate there. Third, the State
imposed taxes on international trade and non-tariff barriers. Fourth, although there was a tendency to retract the operational
budget expenditures, public investment continued in an upward trend. The government has not canceled or postponed even
mega projects, a powerful anti-cyclical policy. Nevertheless a privatization program was launched, which was a source of
fiscal surpluses in the years preceding the crisis. Finally, according to Jomo (1998), the government promoted banking reform
and recapitalized commercial banks, which contributed to the recovery of bank liquidity and allowed a greater economic
stability compared to other SEANICs.
21
   Between 1995 and 1999, interest rates rose to 5.9% in Malaysia and 8% in Thailand. Already in the 2000s, they decreased to
2.8% in both. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, interests behaved differently, as well as inflation rates. Both variables recorded higher
levels. The interest rate was in a high baseline over 10% between 1985 and 1995, but in 200s it drop to 1.1
22
   “In the 1980s and 90s China did not follow the flying geese pattern of industrialization and promoted industrialization in
many sectors at once. The international competitiveness of Chinese light industries, heavy industries, and machinery were
simultaneously improved” (YOKOKAWA, 2012, p. 18).
23
   “China’s open-door has attracted a large amount of foreign investment and many labour-intensive and capital- and
technology-intensive industries have been moved to China. For instance, Hong Kong has almost moved its entire
manufacturing industries to Mainland China while continuing to act as a financial and service centre. Taiwan and Mainland
China have developed similar highly dependent economic relations in recent years. As a result of these shifts, the regional
growth pattern and convergence structure was also beginning to change (XING, 2007, p. 13).
                                                                                                                                  7
was primarily related to the subsector of electronic components and integrated circuits, followed by
electronic data processing and electrical equipment, and telecommunication products (WTO, 2011). In
turn, the external insertion of Thailand in the early eighties focused on agricultural products (63%),
particularly rice, rubber, jute, maize and cassava flour. The process of export diversification was
leveraged in the seventies, after the release of manufactured exports (previously prohibited) in the III
five-year development plan in 1972 (RASIAH, 2003). In the nineties, Thai exports of manufactures were
already more diversified, especially electronic goods data processing, telecommunications, apparel,
textiles. The road vehicles industry has become so notable that in the mid-nineties it was the largest in
Southeast Asia, earning the nickname "Detroit of Asia" (DONER, 2009, p. 32). However, while the
average share of manufacturing exports in the three countries was the highest in history between 2000 and
2004 at the end of the decade NR and NR processed goods regained share. Manufactured exports fell
from 53% to 43% in Indonesia, 79% to 71% in Malaysia and only 77% to 76% in Thailand (see Table in
the Annex).
   So it is not surprising that half of the top ten exports products of Malaysia and Thailand are natural
resources, and in Indonesia the whole list (Annex Tables A7 and A8). By technological content, in
Indonesia the primary products remained stable since 1985 with a share of 20% and the growth of
manufacturing concentrated in sectors related to the NR-processed goods (18% in 2005-2009). Textiles
and clothing were important at the first stage of export diversification in SEANICs, especially in
Thailand, but it continually lost share in total exports at benefit of electronics, telecommunications and
automotive vehicles too. Actually in Thailand and, more strongly, in Malaysia, there was a significant
growth of high and medium technological intensity manufacturing in exports (see Table A9). However
technological intensity may be a misleading indicator because it includes final products that usually were
only assembled in the country but did not added a high amount of value domestically (ECLAC (2007),
OCDE/ WTO (2013a).
   The degree of sophistication in exports and the degree of its contribution to the growth of the economy
is quite different in the three countries, given the varied share of foreign value added in the production of
manufactured goods related to global value chains (GVCs). According to OECD / WTO (2013a),24 two
indicators are appropriate to measure the contribution of an individual economy to GVC. The first is the
share of foreign value added in exports, a backward index. The other is the value-added of the domestic
economy in the exports of other countries, which is a forward index. The sum of the two provides a proxy
of one country’s participation in GVCs. In general smaller economies have bigger forward indexes once
they have less ability to internally diversify production. And if an economy is promoting export-oriented
industrialization, this trend also grows - as is the case of Malaysia, who in 2009 had 40% foreign value
added in its exports. Thailand was not far behind, registering something like 35% (chart 7). Whilst
Indonesia, like other big economies that export natural resources, such as Australia and Brazil, showed
lower foreign content in exports. China and Japan show backward indexes of about 20%, which is also
low because of their economy’s size. Otherwise, the forward index tends to be higher in economies that
provide inputs (including raw materials) to other countries, which is the case of the three SEANICS and
especially Japan. Thus, adding the two effects, it is estimated that the participation of Malaysia is one of
the largest among developing countries at around 65%, followed by Thailand - something like 50% and
Indonesia - 40%. Japan and China also register a total participation n GVC around 40%.
   Productive stages that generate higher value added are at the extremes of the GVC (OECD / WTO,
2013a), still concentrated in the developed economies (in the case of Asia, Japan and Korea). As it was
said before, the hierarchical position of SEANICs (although important efforts technological capabilities
are changing this position in a strict sense) is limited to the production of low added value manufacturing
stages, in general related to assembling – especially in Thailand and in some specific manufacturing
sectors of Indonesia and Malaysia. Table 2 shows that manufacturing is the sector that contain most of
foreign value-added in exports (line b). Japan presents the largest domestic value in exports and there
manufacturing has the biggest share in exports’ value (line a). The share of domestic value added in

a lower scale25) present greater foreign value added in total exports, both in final goods and intermediate
inputs (line d). And the domestic value added by SEANICs in final goods and intermediate inputs seems
to be processed and re-exported more than in China and USA. Japan also presents a high share of
domestic value-added processed probably due to the high share of machinery in exports.

    There is considerable intersection between the sources of FDI and the origin of imports. In all three
countries, a significant portion of the firms were foreign-owned (RASIAH, 2003), and they traced a
fairly clear division of labor: in Indonesia, textiles, clothing, footwear and plywood - and, more recently,
some electronic products; Thailand, textiles and clothing , food and electronics; Malaysia, electronics and
telecommunication industry (WTO data). Main imports of SEANICs both 1980 and in 2010 were
machinery and transport equipment, whose main source was Japan in 1980, but in 2010 was China (Table
A2 in the Annex). As stated previously, the profile of the destination of SEANICs’ exports reveals that
Japan and Korea import NR-processed products and fuel more than the average, while European and
American imports are relatively more concentrated in machinery and transport equipment. In 1980, Japan
and the USA were isolated the two main destinations of SEANICs’ exports, but in 2010 not only their
share in have been reduced, but also have similar or even lower importance than China as a in terms of all
product types. The greater relevance of Chinese imports and exports to SEANICs is related to Chinese
companies’ greater integration into supply chains, especially in manufacturing, relegating the production
of low value added products to laggard geese.
    Thus, on the one hand, SEANICs (along with China) firmed themselves as exporters of
"manufacturing staples" to the U.S. and Western Europe. On the other hand Japan and Korea direct their
production of capital goods, parts and components to the SEANICs and other ASEAN. This means that
SEANICs kept a trade deficit with Japan and a surplus with the U.S. in the nineties.
    The rise of China as a major manufacturing world hub throughout the 1990s generated great impact on
these economies as she began to absorb FDI flows and shift their exports to mayor consumer markets, but
at the same time, due to her great scale, China has been being a key consumer market to the economies of
the region (Medeiros, 2006). Therefore, on the one hand trade balance of China recently (2009) shows
deficit with Asian countries in gross terms and almost a zero balance in value-added terms (chart A2 in
the Annex). On the other hand, China had surplus with OECD – what shows the logic of feeding the
region to make profitable in the rich markets outside it. This is exact the role that Japan played until the
2000s, but now it has change because trade balance shows surplus with NICs, China and Thailand
(although it is much smaller in value-added terms). Just as YOKOKAWA (2012, p. 21) shows, “now
China imports capital goods from Japan, Korea and Taiwan, food and raw material from less developed
countries, and exports completed products to the EU, USA, Asia, and other areas. The cross-border
division of work and trade in East Asia has been completely rebuilt by China, and the Japan-led Pacific
Rim triangle trade regime has been replaced by a China-centric East Asian production network”. So the
impact of China on these countries is contradictory because on the one hand Chinese companies are direct
competitors in many productive activities, dislocating SEANICs exports. On the other hand, due to its
huge relative size, Chinese domestic market absorbs exports of these countries, especially of traditional
goods. Indeed China’s imports from SEANICS are propitiating their high net export growth. This
dynamics constitutes, therefore, the classic vertical division of labor.

    3) Consequences of the external insertion towards production and employment

   The direct effect of the development of SEANICs’ external integration on the productive structure is
clear: nowadays the industrial sector of Indonesia (in a lower degree), Malaysia and Thailand have
significantly higher share in GDP than world average. However, there is huge contrast between their GDP
and employment structures (Tables A5 and A6 in the Annex). While primary goods accounted for 9% to
14% of value added in Indonesia and Thailand, in terms of employment it accounts to 40% of the total. In
turn, the total industrial activity has an average weight of 47% in the value added of SEANICs, while
employment recorded a weight of 22% in Indonesia and Thailand, and 36% in Malaysia. In services there
was a more balanced correspondence, with 40% average share in value added and employment in the
three countries. The big contingent of rural employees is associated to the precarious process of
agricultural modernization26 in Thailand and Indonesia. While in Indonesia, whose percentage of arable

26 More than the increase in productivity, agricultural modernization is a complex process that transforms rural social
structures, which are related to specific geographical, institutional and demographic features. The true modernization of
agriculture integrates the economy and reduces inequalities across sectors.
                                                                                                                       10
land is similar to Malaysia, the average farm machinery was approximately 3 per 100 km2 in Malaysia
this indicator was 240 (WDI, 2011). With the exception of Malaysia, where the value added per worker in
agriculture more than doubled and grew in a pace of 3.2% per year between 1980 and 2010, in the other
countries the growth rate was lower: 2.3% in Thailand and 1.6% in Indonesia (WDI, 2011). Thus the low
productivity in agriculture is an issue that suggests that in Thailand, and more severely in Indonesia,
structural heterogeneity remains27.
   The exam of the productive structure also leads to this conclusion. Comparing the current
configuration of manufacturing value-added (MVA) at Table 3, there is a significant contrast between
manufacturing industries across SEANICs. Indonesia has a strong food and beverage industry, which
accounted for nearly half of the production of the manufacturing industry in 2009. Noteworthy are also
the industry of refined oil, coke and nuclear energy, metal products and motor vehicles. The vehicle
industry, incidentally, has similar weight in the three countries, being a little less significant in Malaysia.
In Malaysia, the main industries are telecommunications, refined oil, food and beverages, rubber and
plastics and chemicals. In Thailand, main industries are office equipment, measuring and counting
(computers), food and beverages, clothing and vehicles. Moreover, contrasting the industry composition
of these countries against the world, it may be concluded that Malaysia is more in line to the world’s
average - especially with regard to the importance of high-tech industry of telecommunications
(communications equipment, television and radio) - whose MVA share is 27%.

   Many contrasts are also clear in the labour market. Sub-sectors that concentrate more labour-force in
Indonesia are textiles and clothing, food and tobacco (Table 4). Indonesian wages are the lowest

  As put by Lewis (1954), dualism (as we here referred as structural heterogeneity) happens in underdeveloped economies
when a small part of the workforce is in modern capitalist sector (the sector of tradable products, usually commodities), in
which labour is relatively well-paid and presents high productivity. The other part of the work-force lives in a subsistence
activities in rural or in backward urban services (the non-tradable sectors) under low wages and productivity. So the economy
operates with elastic supply of labor, low pressure in wages, and low levels of investment per worker and productivity growth.
                                                                                                                            11
comparing to SEANICs and CHINA and represent a small portion of the value added of each industry.
Thus, the share of wages in major industries in 2009 was less than 14%, and the ratio annual wage per
employee was between U.S. $ 1,122 and U.S. $ 1,825. In Malaysia, the industries that employ more
generate greater value-added than the ones prevalent in Indonesia, enabling greater share of wages in
Malayan value added, with the average salary being nearly five times higher than Indonesian. The largest
subsectors in terms of employment in Thailand are similar both to Malaysia and Indonesia: textiles,
processed meats and fats, valves and tubes and plastic. Average wages are low, though higher than
Indonesian wages. It should be noted that currently the average wage in China is above Indonesian’s and
Thailand’s, but lower than the Malaysian. This gap between productivity and wages translates the
dominance of the export strategy in recent years in SEANICs, and thus a source of economic
vulnerability.

   The technological content of the productive structures of the three countries is associated to the export
sector, and therefore to the FDI and multinational companies. As it was shown until a certain extent
foreign activity in SEANICs perform only assembly stages, relegating technology-intensive stages to
other locations.28 Jomo (2002, p. 13) argues that greater Southeast Asian dependence on FDI compared to
NICs “raises disturbing questions about the actual nature of industrial and technological capacities and
capabilities in these countries, especially in their most dynamic and export-oriented sectors. This, in turn,
raises concerns about the sustainability of their growth and industrialization processes, especially if they
28
  According to OECD/ WTO (2013b), foreign content in Indonesian exports from is more significant in machinery and
equipment (40%), electrical and optical equipment (27%) and textiles / footwear / leather (26% in 2009). Total foreign value
added in Indonesian exports is originated in the European Union (38%), China (11%), Japan (10%) and the USA (8%).
Unfortunately there is no data available for Malaysia and Thailand.
                                                                                                                           12
are later deemed less attractive as sites for further FDI, e.g. as more attractive alternative locations
become available”. So on the one hand the State in SEANICs had a key role in the economic development
in terms of planning and industrial policy, fostering important institutions to diversify manufacturing
production and trade, and contributing directly to the injection of income into the economy via increase in
public spending and investment. But States in these countries did not build strong institutions similar to
those built by the first East Asian developmental state centered on technological upgrading and
endogenous technology. Geopolitical and internal reasons, (as the role played by land classes and by the
associated commercial and industrial groups) prevented Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to follow a
better route for industrialization like Japan and NICs.

Final notes
   Over the years trade diversification of SEANICs by their integration in regional production chains
resulted in high exports growth rate, which was associated to massive imports and was led by high
inflows of foreign direct investment and public investment. This dynamics enabled sustained economic
growth, though structurally unbalanced and vulnerable. The relatively high productivity of manufacturing
exports does not reflect the existence of sophisticated techniques but stems mainly from the combination
of foreign investment and cheap labor mainly employed in labor-intensive activities,29 maintaining a
standard of competition focused on low labor costs and on the undervalued exchange rate. SEANICs
development is strongly related to the regional productive integration led by Japan. Indonesia, Malaysia
and Thailand are important consumer markets for high-value added manufactures from Japan (and NICs)
and they provide raw materials and inputs for the production of higher value-added manufactures,
especially capital goods, parts and components in Japan and China more recently. The market for their
labour-intensive manufacture goods are basically the USA and Europe. Thus generically speaking
SEANICS are in charge of low value-added activities, that are not intensive in knowledge nor technology.
This development model has a dependent nature and still faces serious structural problems such as low
technological and knowledge capability, FDI dependence and productivity lags in non-tradable sectors.
   SEANICs’ development pattern and external insertion have been impacted by the rise of China, which
generated growing rivalry in the labor-intensive manufacturing industry, but at the same time has
increased the demand for exports of goods based on NR and manufactures articulated to GVC. At the
present, this growth pattern shows several critical points. Indeed, since the 2008 crisis, the reduced
growth of industrialized economies has led to increased competition among manufacture exporters and an
even greater predominance of China in these markets. Rising wages in China allows some survival to
SEANIC’s pattern of external insertion, however hardly this condition will reduce vulnerability and the
dilemmas that mark this type of economic growth. Thus, the search for another type of development
where further expansion of real wages is combined to investments to build another insertion model based
on activities of higher technological content and higher value added is the main challenge to maintaining
sustainable development in these economies and to overcome the structural difficulties related to low per
capita income, urbanization and the heterogeneity between the tradable and non-tradable sectors. A
possibly alternative growth strategy may rest in the enforcement of domestic economic and industrial
policies that historically were important for their industrialization, such as public investment, rise of
minimum wages, credit expansion, and others that had strengthen national consumption and investment.
These policies could contribute for a higher employment in manufacturing, and they constitute a
distinguishing determinant of the economic growth strategy less dependent on exports growth as it
happens in the dismal performance observed in Mexico and others national strategies limited to
production of low value industrial activities.
   Usual developmental literature emphasizes the importance of manufacturing diversification to generate
high growth rates and a higher degree of homogeneity across economic activities. Allegedly the higher
share of manufacturing in exports and in the productive structure may propitiate that more people benefit
from technological progress, moreover; it could allow technological catch up. SEANICs’ cases
demonstrate that this is not necessarily true. These processes were experienced in a small scale there
29
 Export sectors have low linkage effects in the domestic economy, according to some calculation made out of input-output
matrices in Reis (2012).
                                                                                                                      13
during the years of structural change from natural resources into manufacturing products. In times
characterized by great expansion of productive chains, simply integrating to them may generate some
growth and export diversification. However, the key challenge is to assume a key position in the GVC.
The more distant is it from technical progress, the more elusive is the industrialization as a process that
lifts income and spills over technical progress. So once SEANICs industries are not in a privileged
position in global value chains, their manufacture development did not guarantee the overcoming of
structural heterogeneity nor the technological catch-up.
