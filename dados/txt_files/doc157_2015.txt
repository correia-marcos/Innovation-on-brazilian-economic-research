Sovereign credit ratings play an important role in determining the terms and the extent
to which countries have access to international capital markets, mainly for developing
countries. With this in mind, this study analyzes the determinants of sovereign ratings of
developing countries given by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch for the period
1994-2013. Regarding the econometric model, besides usual OLS method for panel data
analysis, we make use of dynamic panel data framework (D-GMM and S-GMM). Our
findings show that there is a basic set of macroeconomic variables that affect sovereign
ratings: GDP growth, per capita GDP, inflation, foreign reserves, government budget
balance and external debt. Moreover, the adoption of the inflation targeting, greater
financial openness and democratic accountability enhance the ratings of three agencies,
while exchange rate stability, law and order and less corruption increase the ratings of at
least one agency.

Notas de crédito soberano possuem um importante papel para determinar os termos e a
magnitude com que os países têm acesso aos mercados de capitais internacionais,
especialmente os países em desenvolvimento. Com isso em mente, esse estudo analisa
os determinantes das notas de crédito soberano da Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s e Fitch
de países em desenvolvimento. Quanto ao modelo econométrico, além do usual método
MQO para dados em painel, empregamos uma análise de dados em painel dinâmicos
(D-GMM e S-GMM). Nossos achados mostram que existe um conjunto básico de
variáveis macroeconômicas que afetam as notas das agências: crescimento do PIB, PIB
per capita, reservas internacionais, orçamento do governo e dívida externa. Além disso,
a adoção de metas para inflação, maior abertura financeira e responsabilidade
democrática elevam as notas das três agências, enquanto que inflação, estabilidade da
taxa de câmbio, cumprimento da lei e da ordem e menos corrupção aumentam as notas
de pelo menos uma das agências.

1. Introduction

       Sovereign credit ratings play an important role in determining the terms and the
extent to which countries have access to international capital markets. According to
Reinhart (2002), while developed countries take international capital market access for
granted, on the other hand, many low income countries have no access to international
lending even under relatively favorable conditions. In turn, regarding developing
countries, access to international capital markets is highly variable across time. It is for
these developing economies that the sovereign credit ratings play their most critical
role.
       Sovereign ratings are a condensed assessment of a government’s ability and
willingness to repay its public debt on time. A rating is a forward-looking estimate of
the default probability, i.e., sovereign credit ratings are supposed to serve as a summary
measure of a country’s likelihood of default (Cantor and Packer, 1996; Reinhart, 2002).
Such measures of the probability of default are particularly relevant for international
financial markets, economic agents, and governments (Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 2005;
Afonso, Gomes and Rother, 2011).
       In recent years, the demand for sovereign ratings has increased mainly due to the
inevitable globalization of markets. Investors and particularly managed funds are
increasingly focused on international diversification. A change in sovereign ratings can
be a major input in the re-weighting of international portfolios (Bissoondoyal-Bheenick,
2005). Therefore, governments and investors have the need to understand what factors
rating agencies put more emphasis on when attributing a rating score.
       The main private credit risk rating agencies are Moody’s Investors Service,
Standard & Poor’s (S&P), and Fitch ratings. These agencies use a combination of
several quantitative and qualitative variables (economic, social, and political) in order to
assign a credit rating to a debtor. Because they do not announce their methodologies
explicitly, an important issue is to identify the factors behind their assignment of
sovereign credit ratings. Although there are studies on the determinants of sovereign
ratings (Cantor and Packer, 1996; Afonso, 2003; Altenkirch, 2005; Hill, Brooks and
Faff, 2010; Afonso, Gomes and Rother 2011), the literature that addresses solely the
category of developing countries is still scarce (Archer, Biglaiser and DeRouen, 2007;
Biglaiser and Staats, 2012; Erdem and Varli, 2014).
       This study investigates the determinants of sovereign risk ratings in developing
countries. Some of the economic relationships studied in this paper have already been
investigated in the literature. Therefore, in addition to the economic aspects1
traditionally addressed in studies of this nature, the present study contributes to the
literature by adding other important economic aspects which have not yet been analyzed
and which have guided economic policy decisions in many countries from the 1990s.
Among the new aspects analyzed in this study is the effect caused by the adoption of
inflation targeting. The adoption of this economic policy framework by a number of
countries (developed and developing) from the 1990s redefined the way to conduct
monetary and fiscal policies. Moreover, it attributed greater importance to the
commitment made by the governments in relation to their goals and therefore to the
issues related to credibility, reputation and transparency. In this sense, the adoption of
inflation targeting may have contributed to improving sovereign risk ratings, since the
countries that have adopted this strategy had to increase the level of accountability and
commitment to the established (fiscal and monetary) objectives. Also with regard to
1
  These economic aspects are: GDP per capita, GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, budget
balance/GDP, reserves/GDP and foreign debt service/exports.
economic aspects, due to the fact that developing countries are strongly influenced by
disorders that affect the international liquidity, the behavior of exchange rates and the
mood of financial markets, we added the effects of financial openness, exchange rate
stability and the subprime crisis. In this sense, we contribute to the literature by
providing new findings about the economic determinants of sovereign risk ratings.
       In turn, since we are looking at developing countries, institutional and governance
aspects must also be considered. These aspects are likely to affect the sovereign risk
ratings because they act on the institutional design of governments and on the way that
governments operate. In this sense, the study also contributes to the literature since it
analyzes the effects of corruption, law enforcement and the degree of democratic
accountability on such ratings. The idea is that countries will receive better sovereign
ratings once they present lower levels of corruption, stronger legal courts and higher law
enforcement, as well as higher levels of democratic accountability. Hence, due to the
fact that the present study also considers such aspects, the findings regarding the effects
of these variables on sovereign credit ratings represent novelties to the literature.
       Unlike other studies, which mostly use one or two ratings in the analysis (usually
Moody's and/or Standard & Poor's ratings), in this study, we use the three main ratings
(Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch’s). We have compiled a panel data set on
sovereign risk ratings, economic data, and governance and institutional variables for 41
developing countries2 from 1994 to 2013. A feature of the sample is that approximately
60% of the countries in the analysis, at some point of time, ceased to pay its debts, i.e.,
have default history. Hence, default history is a characteristic of the sample.

2. Literature review

       The literature regarding the study of sovereign credit rating is vast in different
directions. Some works analyze the influence of changes in sovereign ratings on the
domestic financial sector and on the inflows of international capital. This is the case of
Kim and Wu (2008), which restricted their investigation to developing countries during
1995-2005. They found evidence that long-term foreign currency sovereign credit
ratings are important for encouraging financial intermediary development and for
attracting capital flows. Other studies aim to measure the accuracy of the rating
agencies. For instance, Gaillard (2013) analyzed the accuracy of the three main agencies
from January 2001 to January 2013. His findings suggested that ratings issued by Fitch,
Moody’s and S&P became less accurate after the default of Greece in 2012, however,
regarding regulatory purposes, credit ratings can be more suitable than market-based
indicators. On the other hand, Schumacher (2014) shed some light to the self-fulfilling
aspect of sovereign ratings. The results provide evidence for a significant two-way
interaction between the macroeconomic environment and changes in sovereigns’
ratings. Thus, rating changes are able to exacerbate a country’s boom–bust cycle.
       There are also studies that tried to identify the factors behind the assessment of
sovereign ratings. This literature shows that there is a basic set of macroeconomic
variables which affect sovereign credit ratings. These variables are: per capita income,
inflation, GDP growth, external debt, fiscal balance and sovereign default history. The
work of Cantor and Packer (1996) investigates the main determinants of sovereign
credit ratings given by S&P and Moody’s. Their findings indicate that per capita
income, GDP growth and, economic development positively affect sovereign credit

 The classification of countries as developing countries follows the classification of the International
Monetary Fund (World Economic Outlook – WEO).
See, http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/groups.htm
ratings while inflation, external debt and default history have a negative influence on
ratings. Using the rating classifications of S&P and Moody's, Afonso (2003) expanded
the analysis for a universe of 81 developed and developing countries in June 2001. He
finds significant results for the same group of independent variables as Cantor and
Packer (1996) for both agencies, however, external debt as a percentage of exports is
relevant only for developing countries.
       Altenkirch (2005) widened the analysis of the determinants of sovereign ratings
by pointing out that a bias in the previous results of the literature might had occurred
regarding the adoption of OLS and POLS techniques. In this sense, he combines a
general-to-specific model selection with dynamic panel data estimation in order to
resolve this issue. The analysis refers to the determinants of sovereign credit ratings
given by Moody’s to 26 countries. Using a wide range of variables, a model is specified
with the following regressors: inflation, the ratio of the current account balance to GDP,
the ratio of foreign reserves to GDP, the ratio of domestic savings to GDP, political
rights, regional warfare, growth in exports, and the ratio of total debt to GDP. As
opposed to the previous studies, inflation had mixed results regarding its significance,
and only political rights and the export growth rate showed significant results in all
dynamic panel data estimations.
       Bissoondoyal-Bheenick (2005) analyzes the determinants of sovereign ratings
provided by the two main agencies (Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s). The analysis
also provides a forecast of the ratings to be assigned to the countries based on the model
used as well as providing ratings to be assigned to a set of weaker economies which are
not actually rated by the rating agencies. The sovereign ratings was discriminated in
three different groups, one with the full sample of 95 countries, other with only 25 high
rated countries and one last with only 70 low rated countries. The ordered response
model estimation was adopted for the period from December 1995 to December 1999.
The set of independent variables for the full sample was: per capita income, inflation,
fiscal balance, debt-to-GDP ratio, real exchange rate, foreign reserves and the net of
exports as percentage of GDP. Furthermore, unemployment and unit labor cost were
included in the estimation for the high rated countries, whilst in the case for the low
rated countries, the net export/GDP was replaced by current account balance and the
external debt was included. Per capita income and inflation rate showed the most
significant results for both group of countries. Specifically for the low rated group,
current account balance and the level of foreign reserves played an important role to
determine the level of sovereign ratings as well. The main finding of the paper is that
current economic and financial indicators alone do not determine ratings. In addition,
the relevance of economic variables is not the same across the different rating
categories. Economic variables do not carry the same importance for the sample of high
rated countries with a long financial stability history as compared to the low rated
sample of countries that are still undergoing structural changes.
       In addition to S&P and Moody’s, some works also include Fitch’s rating in the
analysis regarding the determinants of sovereign credit ratings. Hill, Brooks and Faff
(2010) verify the determinants of sovereign ratings of these three main rating agencies
by covering a large sample of countries (129 countries) over the period from April 1990
to March 2006. Additionally to the independent variables taken in consideration in
Cantor and Packer (1996), the study of Hill, Brooks and Faff (2010) also includes the
square of GDP growth, the Institutional Investor country risk, derived from the opinions
of financial experts, and the market premium risk. The results showed that six variables
are common determinants of all three agencies sovereign ratings: per capita income,
GDP growth and its square, default history, the Institutional Investor rating and the risk
premium. Inflation rate, current account balance, external debt and fiscal balance were
significant for only two or fewer agencies.
        Afonso, Gomes and Rother (2011) also included the three main risk ratings
agencies – 66 countries for Moody’s, 65 for S&P and 58 for Fitch – in order to identify
the determinants of sovereign credit ratings for the period 1995 – 2005. By applying a
panel data framework with linear and ordered response models, it is adopted a
specification which admitted to distinguish between short- and long-run effects of the
explanatory variables. A wide range of potential determinants were used in the
estimations embracing macroeconomic, fiscal and external conditions as well as the
history of default of the country, whether it joins the European Union and lastly its
geographical location. The results pointed out that per capita income, GDP growth,
government debt, and the fiscal balance have a short-run effect on sovereign default
ratings, whilst government effectiveness, external debt, foreign reserves and the default
history are important long-run determinants.
        Regarding the literature on the determinants of sovereign credit ratings of
developing countries, some works can be underlined. This is the case of Archer,
Biglaiser and DeRouen (2007), which extended the discussion by adding a political
aspect, i.e., the influence of the so-called “democratic advantage”. The sample
comprises the three main sovereign credit ratings (S&P, Moody’s and Fitch) of 50
developing countries, and the period runs from 1987 to 2003. The study applied a panel
data set, with three groups of explanatory variables: (1) regime type and political
institutions; (2) macroeconomic conditions; and (3) the default history, natural resource
stocks and commitment to trade. The findings indicated that political variables have
little impact on sovereign credit default ratings. By the way, merely the length of tenure
of the executive’s party showed to affect sovereign ratings given by Moody’s. On the
other hand, economic factors such as GDP growth, inflation, commitment to trade and
the default history disclosed to be significant variables to impact sovereign ratings of
developing countries.
        Biglaiser and Staats (2012) extended the work of Biglaiser and DeRouen (2007)
by including institutional and political variables not considered before, such as society’s
obedience to the rule of law, the presence of a reliable judicial system and the protection
of rights. The estimations cover 36 developing countries for the period 1996 – 2006.
Beyond the political conditions, Biglaiser e Staats (2012) also control for
macroeconomic variables including per capita income, GDP growth, external debt,
inflation and current account balance. Their findings indicate that rule of law, strong
and independent courts, and protection of property rights have significant positive
effects on ratings of developing countries. Finally, Erdem and Varli (2014) tried to
determine the factors behind the assessment of sovereign ratings given by S&P of eight
developing countries from 2002 to 2011. In addition to the macroeconomic variables
selected by Biglaiser e Staats (2012), it was also included in the estimations the fiscal
balance, governance indicators, foreign reserves as percentage of GDP, unemployment
and exchange rate. The results indicate that the more relevant variables related with
credit ratings of developing countries are: budget balance, per capita income,
governance indicators and foreign reserves/GDP.
3. Data and Methodology

3.1 Data description

      In this study, we consider sovereign credit ratings produced by Standard and
Poor's (S&P’s) and Moody’s on a total of 41 developing countries (where 13 countries
are inflation targeters) for the period 1994 to 2013 (see Table A.1 in the Appendix A for
country list). Moreover, we also consider sovereign credit ratings produced by Fitch on
a total of 37 developing countries (where 13 countries are inflation targeters) for the
period 1994 to 2011.3 We use yearly data. The choice of this sample period is due to
data availability.
      In general, the ratings given by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch are variations of the
scale A, B or C. Conventionally, the AAA is the top rating given by all agencies. The
lower the rating indicates the higher probability of default. Governments rated above
“BBB” are considered to have “investment grades”, while those rated below “BBB” are
considered to have “speculative grades”. Although the agencies use different symbols,
almost every Moody’s and Fitch’s symbol has its counterpart in the Standard and Poor’s
rating scale. This correspondence allows a comparison of the sovereign ratings assigned
by the three agencies. Table 1 below shows the scales of ratings made by the agencies,
where we have an increasing numerical scale of risk going from 1 (highest rating) to 23
(lowest rating). The rating assigned for a country in a specific year is the one that was
observed in the end of that year.

 The set of countries used in this analysis is the same as shown in Table A.1, however, Jordan, Pakistan,
Paraguay and, Trinidad and Tobago are not included due to data availability.
       Since one of the main goals of the present study is to respond whether the
adoption of inflation targeting (IT) is important to improve sovereign credit ratings in
developing countries, we must define the IT dummy variable, ITi,t. This dummy variable
equals to 1 if country i is an inflation targeter in period t and 0 if not. The existing
literature diverges on when to date the adoption of IT, whether with the start of partial
inflation targeting (e.g., Corbo Landerretche and Schmidt-Hebbel (2002) and Gonçalves
and Salles (2008)), or only when full-fledged IT was adopted (e.g., Mishkin (2000),
IMF (2006), Batini and Laxton (2007) and Brito and Bystedt (2010)). Because most of
the studies works with Batini and Laxton’s (2007) IT adoption dates, we follow Brito
and Bystedt (2010) and also justify our choice based on Mishkin (2000). In addition to a
public announcement of numerical targets for future inflation, an inflation targeting
economy has to fulfill requirements of institutional subordination of other goals,
information disclosure and accountability. Hence, in the present study, the dummy
variable considers the dates of adoption of IT based on conservative classification4 (this
is the case where there exists an explicit inflation target and full-fledged IT was
adopted).
       In turn, the set of key macroeconomic fundamentals which we employ as the
determinants of sovereign credit ratings from selected developing countries were
determined based on the empirical literature, i.e., these variables are present in most of
the empirical literature regarding the determinants of sovereign credit ratings (e.g.,
Afonso (2003), Bissoondoyal-Bheenick (2005) and Erdem and Varli (2014)). This set of
macroeconomic variables will comprise our baseline model. The baseline model
consists of the following variables: (GBB) central government budget balance as a
percentage of GDP; (FDSE) foreign debt service as a percentage of exports of goods
and services; (GDPP) per capita GDP; (GDPG) GDP growth; (INF) inflation;
(RESERVES) reserves as percentage of GDP; (UNEMP) rate of unemployment, and;
(SUBPRIME) dummy variable for the effect from the subprime mortgage crisis.
Furthermore, we have included other control variables which were not analyzed in the
literature yet. Therefore, we analyze other dimensions which can influence the ratings.
Also in relation to the economic dimension, the contribution we bring is the inclusion of
the inflation targeting regime (IT dummy variable), as well as the effects of financial
openness (FOI) and exchange rate stability (ERSI). Regarding the institutional
dimension, we will analyze the effect of democratic accountability (DEMOC) as well as
the effect of law and order (LAW). Finally, in the governance dimension, we will
analyze the effect of corruption (CORRUP).5

3.2 Methodology

      This study uses panel data analysis. Besides usual OLS method for panel data
analysis, we make use of dynamic panel data framework (D-GMM and S-GMM). As
pointed out by Arellano and Bond (1991), an advantage of using the dynamic panel data
method (GMM) over others (Ordinary Least Squares – OLS and Generalized Least
Squares – GLS) is that besides eliminating the non-observed effects on the regressions,
the estimates are reliable even in the case of omitted variables. In particular, the use of
instrumental variables allows the estimation of parameters more consistently, even in

Mendonça and de Guimarães e Souza (2012).

  Table A.2 in the Appendix provides details about the variables that we use. Furthermore, Tables A.3 and
A.4 present the descriptive statistics of the variables for the panel data.
the case of endogeneity in explanatory variables and the occurrence of measurement
errors (Bond, Hoeffler and Temple, 2001).
       Traditional econometric models hypothesize that the error term is not correlated
with its estimators. In cases where the estimators are correlated with the error term there
is an endogeneity problem and thus the result of regressions is inconsistent. Wooldridge
(2001) presents three hypotheses for the existence of endogenous variables: omitted
variables, measurement error, and simultaneity in regressions. Variables can be omitted
when, for example, they are not known or not available. Measurement error can occur
when one needs to measure the partial effect of a variable. Finally, simultaneity occurs
when one of the explanatory variables is concomitant with the dependent variable.
       The empirical model developed in this study is subject to the above-mentioned
problems. In short, not all explanatory variables of the model are known and
measurable. In addition, the growth rate of real GDP can be influenced by sovereign
credit ratings, which, in turn, suggests a simultaneity problem. Furthermore, regarding
the endogeneity problem, for example, a macroeconomic shock affects sovereign credit
ratings and thereby the growth rate of real GDP.
       A general solution to the problem of endogeneity is the use of instrumental
variables. In particular, GMM models allow the use of instruments that are sequentially
exogenous, thereby avoiding the endogeneity problem. The model proposed by
Arellano and Bond (1991) consists of the estimation of first-difference GMM panel data
as a way of eliminating non-observed effects. However, Alonso-Borrego and Arellano
(1998), and Blundell and Bond (1998) showed that the first-difference GMM has a bias
(for large and small samples) and low accuracy. Moreover, the use of lags can generate
weak instruments (Staiger and Stock, 1997).
       Blundell and Bond (1998) found results that sustain the use of the system GMM
panel data estimation method instead of first-difference GMM. In the model proposed
by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) regressions in levels and
first differences are combined (see Bond, Hoeffler, and Temple, 2001).
       While D-GMM and S-GMM estimation approaches are suitable for a small
number of time periods (t) and a large number of individuals (i) in small samples, when
the instruments are too many, they tend to over-fit the instrumented variables and bias
the results (Roodman, 2009). Hence, with the objective of avoiding the use of an
excessive number of instruments in the regressions and thus lose the power of tests, the
number of instruments/number of cross-sections ratio must be less than 1 in each
regression. Moreover, in order to confirm the validity of the instruments in the models,
the test of over-identifying restrictions (J-test) was used as suggested by Arellano
(2003). In addition, tests of first-order (AR1) and second-order (AR2) serial correlation
were performed. Moreover, White's heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix was
applied on regressions. It is important to highlight that one premise of system GMM
models is the non-correlation of the first difference of endogenous regressors, which
implies that it is not necessary to perform unit root tests.
       Based on the variables described above, the baseline model is given by:



Where      is the dependent variable, and it represents the numeric rating assigned by the
agencies to the respective country at time t. The subscript i is the index of the country,
is a vector of unknown parameters,        is a parameter,          represents the vector of
macroeconomic explanatory variables of the baseline model for country i one year ago
(t–1), and      is the disturbance.
      The next four specifications include the variables of each dimension:




        All explanatory variables (except the dummy variables, SUBPRIME and IT) are
lagged (t–1) because the ratings are not assigned at the end of the year, i.e., agencies can
assign different notes to a country in the same year, and along it. Therefore, it is
reasonable to think that agencies make use of known information about the countries,
i.e., the information of one year ago.

4. Estimation results

       In this section, we evaluate the findings of the estimates. Tables (2), (3) and (4)
show the estimates obtained through OLS with cross-country fixed effects (FOLS), D-
GMM and S-GMM for the five models adopted, and for the three rating agencies (S&P,
Moody’s and Fitch, respectively). Regarding the baseline model, our estimations show
very consistent outcomes. Whatever the method used or model employed, an increase in
the GDP growth improves the ratings of all agencies. This result is confirmed by many
studies (e.g., Afonso, 2003; Cantor and Packer, 1996; Hill, Brooks and Faff, 2010;
Afonso, Gomes and Rother, (2011).
       Furthermore, per capita income, inflation, foreign reserves and external debt
showed significant results for 44 of 45 estimations. Then, increments in per capita
income and in foreign reserves enhance the bond ratings, while the same occur through
reductions in inflation and in external debt. Similar results are also found in the
literature regarding per capita income (e.g., Cantor and Packer, 1996; Afonso, 2003;
Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 2005; Hill, Brooks and Faff, 2010; Afonso, Gomes and Rother,
2011; Erdem and Varli, 2014), foreign reserves (e.g., Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 2005 –
for low rated countries only; Afonso, Gomes and Rother, 2011; Erdem and Varli, 2014),
inflation (e.g., Cantor e Packer, 1996; Afonso, 2003; Altenkirch, 2005 – for S-GMM
estimations only; Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 2005; Hill, Brooks and Faff, 2010; Afonso,
Gomes and Rother, 2011; Erdem and Varli, 2014) and external debt (e.g., Cantor and
Packer, 1996; Afonso, 2003; Hill, Brooks and Faff, 2010; Afonso, Gomes and Rother,
2011; Erdem and Varli, 2014).
       Additionally, an increase in budget balance appeared to improve the bond ratings
in 41 estimations. The significance of the budget balance is also found in the literature
(e.g., Afonso, 2003 – for Moody’s in 2 specifications of the linear estimations and for
S&P in one specification of the logistic estimation; Hill, Brooks and Faff, 2010;
Afonso, Gomes and Rother, 2011; Erdem and Varli, 2014). Finally, unemployment
showed mixed results regarding its significance, but still, in all estimations it exhibits
the expected signal. However, the statistic insignificance of unemployment is common
in the literature (e.g., Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 2005 – applied this variable only for high
rated countries; Afonso, Gomes and Rother, 2011 – only the three-year average was
significant; and Erdem and Varli, 2014).
       Now let us turn to the variables that are our main contribution into the economic
dimension. First, the adoption of inflation targeting appears to be an important factor in
order to improve sovereign ratings of all the three agencies. Moreover, the adoption of
this policy framework shows to be able to enhance sovereign ratings. Therefore, this
outcome might shed some light to the concern that credit rating agencies put on
commitment and accountability of the government with its macroeconomic stability, as
well as, the relevance of this policy to halt this worry. Second, financial openness
showed significant results in both dynamic panel data approaches for all the three
agencies. Especially for S&P and Fitch, this variable has a stronger effect on its bond
default assessment, since a one-point increase is capable to improve their sovereign
ratings between one and three notches. These results should be expected mainly for
developing countries, once a more open capital account brings liquidity and helps the
government to fulfill its obligations. Third, exchange rate stability showed more
significant results for S&P, although it exhibits the expected signal in 6 of 9
estimations, i.e., a more stable exchange rate raises the sovereign credit ratings.
Although the stability of exchange rate variable has never been used in the literature, the
result regarding its significance is opposed to the studies that used the real exchange rate
as independent variable (e.g., Bissoondoyal-Bheenick, 2005; Erdem and Varli, 2014).
Fourth, whatever the method applied or model employed, the subprime crisis
deteriorated the bond ratings of all agencies. The 2008-2009 period has been marked by
a great international financial instability and credit restrictions, which affect practically
all the countries around the globe and forced the ratings agencies to revise their beliefs
regarding foreign debt payments.
       Concerning our contributions into the institutional and governance dimensions,
our estimations also show interesting results. First, enhance the democratic
accountability seems to improve the sovereign ratings of the three agencies, since all
estimations showed the negative signal and in 6 of 9 estimations this variable was
significant. This result demonstrates that credit rating agencies pay a special attention
into the political aspect by improving the sovereign ratings of more democratic
countries. This outcome goes in opposite direction to some studies that found no
importance of the government’s regime type into the determination of sovereign ratings
(e.g., Archer, Biglaiser and DeRouen, 2007). Second, the obedience to the law, proxy
here by the law and order index, shows to be an important factor especially for S&P,
although it showed mixed results for Moody’s and no significance at all in the case of
Fitch. Even though this variable has not been used before, other studies that work with
rule of law found significance results for all the three agencies (e.g., Biglaiser and
Staats, 2012). Still, an increase in law and order raises the bond ratings in all
estimations. Finally, in relation to the governance aspect, our estimations indicate that
less corrupt countries receive better ratings. In both dynamic panel data estimations for
S&P and Fitch, corruption exhibits statistical significance, albeit it does not happen for
Moody’s estimates.

Note: Marginal significance levels: (***) denotes 0.01, (**) denotes 0.05, and (*) denotes 0.1. White’s heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix was applied in regressions. Standard errors
between parentheses. FOLS – OLS fixed effects. D-GMM – uses two-step of Arellano and Bond (1991) without time period effects. S-GMM – uses two-step of Arellano and Bover (1995) without
time period effects. D-GMM estimator-tests for AR (1) and AR (2) check that the average autocovariance in first order and second-order residuals, respectively, is zero. S-GMM estimator-tests for
AR (1) and AR (2) check for the presence of first order and second-order serial correlation in the first-difference residuals.

Note: Marginal significance levels: (***) denotes 0.01, (**) denotes 0.05, and (*) denotes 0.1. White’s heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix was applied in regressions. Standard errors
between parentheses. FOLS – OLS fixed effects. D-GMM – uses two-step of Arellano and Bond (1991) without time period effects. S-GMM – uses two-step of Arellano and Bover (1995) without
time period effects. D-GMM estimator-tests for AR (1) and AR (2) check that the average autocovariance in first order and second-order residuals, respectively, is zero. S-GMM estimator-tests for
AR (1) and AR (2) check for the presence of first order and second-order serial correlation in the first-difference residuals.

5. Concluding remarks

       Sovereign credit ratings play a very important role in order to attract international
capital mainly for developing countries, since these ratings give valuable information to
investors concerning the probability of default of sovereign bond ratings. With this in
mind, this research put some effort to understand the main determinants of sovereign
ratings of developing countries given by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for the period 1994-
2013. We extended previous works in the literature by including new economic aspects,
as well as, new institutional and governance variables, which had not been included
before. These new aspects considered were the adoption of inflation targeting, the level
of financial openness, exchange rate stability, the degree of democratic accountability,
law enforcement and the effects of corruption. Regarding the econometric model, it was
employed OLS with fixed cross-country effects, as well dynamic panel data approaches.
       Our findings might shed some light to the key aspects that a developing country
should engage or improve, in order to receive better bond ratings, and by consequence,
attract more international capital. Regarding the basic set of macroeconomic variables,
which is commonly used in the literature, our results exhibit evidence that GDP growth,
per capita income, inflation, foreign reserves and external debt are important
determinants of sovereign ratings of developing countries. Although the budget balance
was not significant in four estimations of Moody’s ratings, still, it was a relevant
variable in all estimations of S&P and Fitch. Finally, unemployment showed mixed
results regarding its significance, but still, in all estimations it exhibits the expected
signal.
       Concerning the variables that are our main contribution into the economic
dimension, the adoption of inflation targeting disclosed to be a very relevant aspect in
the sovereign bond default assessment of the three main agencies. The adoption of this
policy framework shows to be able to enhance the bond ratings virtually between one
and a half and half of a notch (Moody’s and S&P SGMM estimations respectively). The
level of financial openness was also an important variable in both dynamic panel data
approaches for all the three agencies. Especially for S&P and Fitch, this variable has a
stronger effect on its bond default assessment, since a one-point increase is capable to
improve their sovereign ratings between one and three notches. Finally, exchange rate
stability showed more significant results for S&P, although it exhibit the expected
signal in 6 of 9 estimations.
       Regarding our contributions into the institutional and governance dimension, our
estimations also show promising results. The increase of the democratic accountability
improves the sovereign ratings of the three agencies. This result demonstrates that credit
rating agencies pay a special attention into the political aspect by improving the
sovereign ratings of more democratic countries. Furthermore, the obedience to the law
shows to be an important factor especially for S&P, although it showed mixed results
for Moody’s and no significance at all in the case of Fitch. Still, an increase in the rule
of law raises the bond ratings in all estimations. Finally, in relation to the governance
aspect, in all estimations the corruption variable had the expected negative signal, i.e.,
less corrupt countries receive better ratings. In both dynamic panel data, estimations for
S&P and Fitch ratings corruption exhibited significance, albeit this not happened in the
Moody’s estimations.

* According to the IMF, Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania are developed countries since 2011,
2014 and 2015 respectively. Due to the fact
that, in most of the period analyzed, such
economies were considered as developing
economies, hence they enter the analysis.
 Table A.2 – Variable list and description
GBB              Risk points for the central government budget balance as a percentage of GDP; the estimated central
                 government budget balance for a given year in the national currency is expressed as a percentage of
                 the estimated GDP for that year in the national currency. The risk points are then assigned from 0 to
                 10, with the highest number (10) indicating the lowest potential risk for that component and the
                 lowest number (0) indicating the highest potential risk. The data was obtained from the International
                 Country Risk Guide (ICRG) and represents the risks associated with general government budget
                 balance. We expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient.
FDSE             Risk points for the foreign debt service as a percentage of exports of goods and services; risk points
                 from 0 to 10 are assigned for the estimated foreign debt service, for a given year, converted into US
                 dollars at the average exchange rate for that year, expressed as a percentage of the sum of the
                 estimated total exports of goods and services for that year, converted into US dollars at the average
                 exchange rate for that year. Once again, the highest number (10) indicates the lowest potential risk
                 for that component and the lowest number (0) indicates the highest potential risk. The data was
                 obtained from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). We expect a negative sign for the
                 estimated coefficient.
GDPP             Per capita GDP of the country can be understood as a universal measure of economic development.
                 Amounts are expressed in constant 2005 prices (US dollars). The data was obtained from the World
                 Bank. We expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient.
GDPG             This variable measures the growth performances of countries, i.e., the growth rate of real GDP. The
                 data was obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IFS). We expect a negative sign for the
                 estimated coefficient.
INFM             This variable refers to the annual percentage change of consumer prices. However, due to the fact
                 that high inflation rates were observed in many developing countries until the mid-1990s, we follow
                 Brito and Bystedt (2010) and use the natural logarithm of inflation, transforming INFn,t into,
                                                    INFMn,t = 100*ln(1+ INFn,t /100).
                 This procedure is used in order to prevent the results from being biased by a group of countries with
                 high inflation. The data was obtained from the World Bank. We expect a positive sign for the
                 estimated coefficient.
UNEMP            This variable corresponds to the rate of unemployment. High unemployment rates are associated
                 with the occurrence of social conflicts, and pressures on the fiscal side, which, in turn, can reduce
                 the government's ability to pay its debts. The data was obtained from the International Monetary
                 Fund (WEO). We expect a positive sign for the estimated coefficient.
ERSI             In order to measure exchange rate stability, we use the index of exchange rate stability, (Aizenman,
                 Chinn and Ito, 2010). The index is available in: http://web.pdx.edu/~ito/trilemma_indexes.htm. We
                 expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient.
FOI              In order to measure financial openness, we use the index of capital account openness, (Aizenman,
                 Chinn and Ito, 2010). The index is available in: http://web.pdx.edu/~ito/trilemma_indexes.htm. We
                 expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient.
DEMOC            Democratic accountability was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). This is a
                 measure of, not just whether there are free and fair elections, but how responsive government is to
                 its people. The less responsive it is, the more likely it will fall. Even democratically elected
                 governments can delude themselves into thinking they know what is best for the people, regardless
                 of clear indications to the contrary from the people. The highest number of risk points (lowest risk)
                 is assigned to alternating democracies, while the lowest number of risk points (highest risk) is
                 assigned to autarchies. We expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient.
LAW              Law and order was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). The variable “Law and
                 Order” form a single component, but its two elements are assessed separately, with each element
                 being scored from zero to three points. To assess the “Law” element, the strength and impartiality of
                 the legal system are considered, while the “Order” element is an assessment of popular observance
                 of the law. It ranks nations on a scale from 0 to 6. A score of 0 represents a low level of Law and
                 Order, while 6 indicates maximum level. We expect a negative sign for the estimated coefficient.
SUBPRIME         In order to capture the effect from the subprime mortgage crisis, we included a dummy variable,
                 which assumes value 1 for the period from 2008 to 2009, and zero otherwise. We expect a positive
                 sign for the estimated coefficient.
CORRUP           We use data on corruption from International Country Risk Guide’s (ICRG) corruption index
                 compiled by Political Risk Services (PRS). The index indicates the opinion of analysts on each
                 country regarding the extent to which high government officials are likely to demand special
                 payments, and illegal payments generally expected throughout lower levels of government in the
                 form of bribes connected with import and export licenses, exchange controls, tax assessment, policy
                 protection, or loans. It ranks nations on a scale from 0 to 6. A score of 0 represents maximum
                 corruption level, while 6 indicates minimum corruption level. We expect a negative sign for the
                 estimated coefficient.
EXCH            The exchange rate expressed in US dollars enters in the estimates as an instrumental variable. The
                data was obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IFS).
INTERNAL        This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). The variable is a
CONFLICT        measure of political violence in the country and its actual or potential impact on governance. The
                risk rating assigned is the sum of three subcomponents: Civil War/Coup Threat, Terrorism/Political
                Violence, and Civil Disorder. It enters in the estimates as an instrumental variable.
EXTERNAL        This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). The variable is a
CONFLICT        measure of both the risk to the incumbent government from foreign action, ranging from non-violent
                external pressure (diplomatic pressures, withholding of aid, trade restrictions, territorial disputes,
                sanctions, etc) to violent external pressure (cross-border conflicts to all-out war). The risk rating
                assigned is the sum of three subcomponents: War, Cross-Border Conflict, and Foreign Pressures. It
                enters in the estimates as an instrumental variable.
BUREAUCRACY     This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). The variable gives high
QUALITY         points to countries where the bureaucracy has the strength and expertise to govern without drastic
                changes in policy or interruptions in government services. In these low-risk countries, the
                bureaucracy tends to be somewhat autonomous from political pressure and to have an established
                mechanism for recruitment and training. Countries that lack the cushioning effect of a strong
                bureaucracy receive low points because a change in government tends to be traumatic in terms of
                policy formulation and day-to-day administrative functions. It enters in the estimates as an
                instrumental variable.
INVESTMENT      This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). This measure considers
PROFILE         factors affecting the risk to investment that are not covered by other political, economic and
                financial risk components. The risk rating assigned is the sum of three subcomponents (Contract
                Viability/Expropriation, Profits Repatriation, and Payment Delays), each with a maximum score of
                four points and a minimum score of 0 points. A score of 4 points equates to Very Low Risk and a
                score of 0 points to Very High Risk.
MILITARY IN     This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). This is a measure of the
POLITICS        military’s involvement in politics. Since the military is not elected, involvement, even at a
                peripheral level, diminishes democratic accountability. Military involvement might stem from an
                external or internal threat, be symptomatic of underlying difficulties, or be a full-scale military
                takeover. Over the long term, a system of military government will almost certainly diminish
                effective governmental functioning, become corrupt, and create an uneasy environment for foreign
                businesses. Overall, lower risk ratings indicate a greater degree of military participation in politics
                and a higher level of political risk.
MONETARY        In order to measure the degree of monetary independence, we use the index developed by
INDEPENDENCE    Aizenman,         Chinn      and      Ito     (2010).      The       index     is     available     in:
                http://web.pdx.edu/~ito/trilemma_indexes.htm.
SOCIOECONOMIC   This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). This is a measure of the
CONDITIONS      socioeconomic pressures at work in society that could constrain government action or fuel social
                dissatisfaction. The risk rating assigned is the sum of three subcomponents: Unemployment,
                Consumer Confidence, and Poverty.
RELIGIOUS       This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). A measure of religious
TENSIONS        tensions arising from the domination of society and/or governance by a single religious group or a
                desire to dominate in a way that replaces civil law by religious law, excludes other religions from
                the political/social processes, suppresses religious freedom or expressions of religious identity. The
                risks involved range from inexperienced people imposing inappropriate policies to civil dissent or
                civil war.
GOVERNMENT      This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). A measure of both of
STABILITY       the government’s ability to carry out its declared program(s), and its ability to stay in office. The
                risk rating assigned is the sum of three subcomponents: Government Unity, Legislative Strength,
                and Popular Support.

ETHNIC          This variable was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). A measure of the degree
TENSIONS        of tension attributable to racial, national, or language divisions. Lower ratings (higher risk) are given
                to countries where tensions are high because opposing groups are intolerant and unwilling to
                compromise.
