Abstract

This paper aims to analyses the effect of a reduction in the prices of healthy foods (thin subsidies) on
the nutritional status and individual acquisition of food for individuals in poverty, between 2 and 9
years old. With the data of a Brazilian family budget survey (POF / IBGE), I estimated a model that
identifies the individual consumption of calories, based on aggregate household consumption,
followed by the estimation of a child health production function, which verifies the effect of a set of
variables on Body Mass Index (BMI), and finally, I estimated children food demand system, for
various food categories (healthy and unhealthy), which allows to obtain variations in the quantities
of food allocated to children, given changes in prices. The implementation of thin subsidies can be
effective for the variability of food destined to children, directly affecting the basket that is to be
stimulated and reduce the unhealthy food consumption. However, a combined discount, given to a
basket of healthy foods, does not modify the total caloric intake. So, this intervention does not reverse
the process of average BMI growth of economically vulnerable children and, consequently, it does
not reduce the incidence of childhood obesity. In general, the analysis proposed was important to
understand how specific policy interventions can contribute to encouraging healthy habits, giving
attention to their impacts on vulnerable individuals.

Resumo

Este estudo propõe analisar o efeito de uma redução nos preços de alimentos saudáveis sobre o estado
nutricional e aquisição individual de alimentos, para indivíduos em situação de pobreza, com idade
entre 2 e 9 anos. Para tanto, com os dados da POF (IBGE), estimou-se um modelo que identifica o
consumo individual de calorias, por meio do consumoagregado domiciliar, seguido pela estimação
de uma função de produção de saúde infantil, que verifica o efeito de um conjunto de variáveis sobre
a distribuição do indicador de estado nutricional utilizado (IMC), e por fim, um sistema de demanda
alimentar infantile, considerando diversas categorias alimentares. Percebe-se que a implementação
de um subsídio ao preço de alimentos saudáveis pode ser eficaz para a variabilidade de alimentos
destinados às crianças, por incidir diretamente na cesta que se deseja estimular, além de reduzir a
quantidade de alimentos prejudiciais à saúde. No entanto, um desconto combinado dado aos preços
de alimentos saudáveis, não altera o consume calórico total. Assim, essa intervenção não é suficiente
para reverter o processo de crescimento do IMC médio de crianças economicamente vulneráveis e,
consequentemente, não reduz a incidência de obesidade infantil. De forma geral, a análise proposta
foi importante para entender como intervenções específicas podem contribuir para incentivar hábitos
alimentares saudáveis, dando atenção aos seus impactos sobre indivíduos vulneráveis.

1. Introduction

         The nutrition transition arises in poor and developing countries, associate with the obesity
prevalence, one of the risk factors of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCCD), which can be
debilitating and even lethal effects (WHO, 2002; 2009). This change also affects the children, mainly
responsible for the epidemic of childhood obesity in several world regions, including areas where
malnutrition was prevalent (WHO, 2017), as is the case in Brazil. In this country, despite the
significative reduce in malnutrition, the childhood obesity the prevalence of obesity in boys increased
from 2.9% to 16.6%, and 1.8% to 11.8% in female children, in three decades (IBGE, 2010a).
         The child obesity associates with the risk of remaining overweight in adulthood, in addition
to the early incidence of NCCDs and psychosocial disorders. In the sense, the World Health
Organization (WHO) reinforces the importance of actions that promote the healthy habits in
childhood (WHITAKER et al., 1997; FRANKS et al., 2010, WHO, 2017). Programs aimed at
preventing childhood obesity can start from schools, since it is the place where children and
adolescents spend most of their time, and it is the responsibility of educators to promote an
environment conducive to exercise and a balanced diet. However, Birch and Ventura (2009) argue
that school-based intervention is ineffective in promoting healthier habits and, consequently, to
reverse the increasing number of obesity cases. According to them, the nutritional status of children
and adolescents is influenced by their own behavior, but is inserted within a higher behavioral pattern,
coming from family. Hence there is the importance not only of childhood nutrition education, but
also to promote changes that affect the population habits.
         In this sense, in this paper I simulate an intervention on Brazilian children's food consumption
pattern and their nutritional status, based in healthy food prices reduction (whose literature term is
thin subsidies). I restrict our analysis to individual, between 2 and 9-year-olds, residing in Brazilian
poor households.
         The intervention on the pattern of household food consumption can be given through food
production control, information policies, as well as measures that affect the budget constraint, such
as the change in food prices (thin subsidies or fat taxes), cash transfer or food assistance
(DREWNOWSKI et al. 2004; MAZZAOCHI, TRAILL, 2005; HIDROBO et al., 2014; FLORES,
RIVAS, 2017). One of the most know food assistance program is the Special Supplemental Nutrition
Program (SNAP or Food Stamps Program), whose benefits can be used to buy food in authorized
retail foods. Nevertheless, the effects of receiving these benefits are ambiguous on child obesity. The
household might allocate the additional money to unhealthy food, depending of the household
preferences (GUNDERSEN, 2015). Changes in the price foods are another intervention on the eating
habits, already implemented in several countries (SMED, 2007). It is believed that the strategy based
in the modification of relative food prices, known as thin subsidies and fat taxes, can generate greater
impact on the demand of food, because it directly affects the policy. Thin subsidies have redistributive
effects, since the individuals with lower income start to consume more healthy foods, being able to
bring more benefits in terms of improvement of the habit formation and health status than fat tax
policies (CASH et al., 2005; FLORES; RIVAS, 2017). The evidence found by Hidrobo et al. (2014)
also reinforce the importance of subsidies, comparing them to income transfers. Through an
experiment, it has been found that giving money (represented by income transfers) or food discount
coupons (representing subsidies) to households improves the quantity and quality of food purchased,
but discount coupons are more important for food diversification.
         There are a several studies that analyses the Food Stamps effect and the food price effects on
food demand, but this analysis is restricted to developing countries and they consider household food
consumption, which does not allow a specific analysis for the different age groups, especially for
children (PAN; JENSEN, 2008; HIDROBO et al., 2014; GUNDERSEN, 2015; LIN et al., 2011;
FLORES; RIVAS, 2017). So, that is necessary to investigate the police effects that can influence
eating habits, not only by the average, because it ignores the impact on most vulnerable individuals,
such as children, who have special dietary needs. In addition, it is necessary to verify incentives for
individuals to improve their eating habits in a vulnerability scenario where income inequality reflects
                                                                                                       2
inequalities in food acquisition, limiting the range of consumption possibilities of poorer individuals,
like Brazil. In this country, the growth childhood obesity accompanies the deterioration of the dietary
pattern in households, especially in poor households. Foods considered healthy (fruits and vegetables)
are less consumed than the high-fat foods, sugars and processed products, emphasizing the preference
of Brazilians for less healthy foods, in all income levels (IBGE, 2010b). However, the data limitation
in the child food consumption does not allow for a specific analysis of the determinants of the amount
of food destined for children and its effects on nutritional status. In the disponible last data base (POF
2008/2009), there are information on food consumption for individuals over 10-year-olds.
        For this limitation, I disaggregate the household food consumption, by approach proposed by
Chesher (1997, 1998) and applied by Bonnet et al. (2014), De Agostini (2005), Parkin (2002) e
Miquel e Lasney (2001). So, I find the amount of food allocated to the public of interest and I estimate
the magnitude and significance of price-elasticities of BMI and demand for healthy and unhealthy
food categories, by specification of a health production function and a demand system theoretical
consistent. The relationship between calorie acquisition rate and nutritional status, along with price
elasticities of demand, also enabled to find the sensitivity degree of nutritional status to a reduction
in healthy food prices (thin subsidies). The simulation of the thin subsidies’ implementation has
proved to be effective and significative for the variety of foods intended for poor children, in addition
to reducing the amount of some foods unhealthy.
        This paper is divided into five sections, include this introduction. The next section, I present
the theoretical model on which I based the estimation of price effects on nutritional status. Section 3
presents the econometric models, variables and database used. The results obtained and the discussion
is presented in the Section 4, while Section 5 presents the final comments.

2. Theoretical Framework

        In a behavior model, it supposes rational individual has an ideal weight, so that being below
or above generates disutility. The welfare derived to the nutritional status is based in subjective
evaluation on the individual physical appearance. It is not chosen directly, so the individual will
determine an optimal level of consumption and expenditure of calories to achieve it. Therefore, the
individual nutritional status (𝐻𝑖 ) is a health production function, in which the inputs are the calorie
consumption (𝑞𝑖 ) and the health endowment (𝜉𝑖 ). The nutritional status results in food choices and
calorie expenditure (PHILIPSON; POSNER, 2003; CAWLEY, 2003). For children, the welfare
maximization depends on choices mother and her health cares for her children (BEHRMAN;
DEOLALIKAR, 1988; REICHMAN et al., 2009). The optimal nutritional status and food destined
for the child will be determined by a utility maximization process:

𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑈 𝑀 (𝐻 𝑀 (𝑞𝑀𝑘 , 𝐼𝑀𝑘 , 𝜉𝑀𝑘 ), 𝐻 𝑖 (𝑞𝑖 , 𝐼𝑀 , 𝜉𝑖 ), 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑦𝑀 , 𝑂𝑀 ),
s.a. ∑𝐿𝑙=1 𝑝𝑘𝑙 𝑦𝑀𝑙𝑘 + ∑𝐿𝑙=1 𝑝𝑘𝑙 𝑦𝑖𝑙𝑘 = 𝑚𝑀𝑘𝑟 +𝑚𝑖𝑘𝑟 ,                                                    (1)

where 𝐻 𝑀 e 𝐻 𝑖 are the mother and child health production function, respectively; 𝐼𝑀 are the mother
characteristics, that influence the owner and child health status; 𝑂𝑀 are the non-food consumption.
𝑦𝑖𝑙𝑘 is the quantity of food l and 𝑝𝑘𝑙 is the price; 𝐶𝑘 is a vector of mother and household characteristics.
The solution of this problem allows find the optimal quantity destined to each member of household
k. It is assumed that purchasing decisions are based in physical quantities of each food, and not
necessarily in nutrients that compose them. Consumer behavior is based in purchased goods, which
is a good measure to access and variability (FAO, 1997; SMED et al., 2007). However, in (1) the
nutritional status will depend of the caloric composition, which is a linear function of the quantity of
food purchased. Since 𝑐𝑙 is the caloric quantity for each kilogram of 𝑦𝑖𝑙𝑘 , the total food converts in
calories is 𝑞𝑖𝑘 = ∑𝐿𝑙=1 𝑐𝑙 𝑦𝑖𝑙𝑘 .
         Utility maximization in (1) can be constrained by budget, biological, and time constraints
(CAWLEY, 2003), with budget constraints being the most significant limitation perceived by the

                                                                                                             3
individual in making their consumption decision. I assume that food expenditures are weakly
separated from spending in other goods and that individuals decide how much to spend on food at a
separate stage of other goods, and that decision will influence their nutritional status. Thus, it should
be considered that only the expenditure (𝑚𝑖𝑘𝑟 ) and the food prices (𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑙 ) constitute the constraint
that the individual faces to maximize its utility (DEATON; MUELLBAUER, 1980a).
        The first order to (1) allows to determine the optimal food level destined to child i, as a price
and expenditure function. The consumer decision influences the nutritional status, so:
            ∗
𝐻𝑖∗ = 𝐻 ∗ (𝑞𝑖𝑘 (𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑙 , 𝑚𝑖𝑘𝑟 ), 𝐼𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉𝑖𝑘 ),                                                           (2)

     For L food categories, in elasticities, the change in health status due a change in prices is
(SCHROETER et al., 2008):

𝑒𝐻𝑝𝑗 = 𝑒𝐻𝑞𝑗 𝑒𝑗𝑗 + ∑𝐽−1
                   𝑙=1 𝑒𝐻𝑞𝑗 𝑒𝑙𝑗 ,                                                                     (3)

where 𝑒𝐻𝑞 is the change in nutritional status due to change in consumption in food l, after the prices
change, 𝑒𝑗𝑗 and 𝑒𝑙𝑗 are the own and cross price elasticities, respectively. The change in 𝐻𝑖𝑘 due the
change in each food (𝑒𝐻𝑞𝑙 ) is measured by the impact in the calories total change (𝑒𝐻𝑞 ). As 𝑞𝑖𝑘𝑟 =
∑𝐿𝑙=1 𝑞𝑖𝑘𝑟𝑙 ⟹ 𝜕𝑞𝑖𝑘𝑟𝑙⁄𝜕𝑞 = 1, so:
                           𝑖𝑘𝑟
         𝜕𝐻 𝜕𝑞    𝑞      𝑞          𝑞
𝑒𝐻𝑞𝑙 = 𝜕𝑞 𝑖𝑘 𝜕𝑞𝑖𝑟𝑘 𝐻𝑖𝑟𝑘𝑙 𝑞𝑖𝑟𝑘 = 𝑒𝐻𝑞 𝑞𝑖𝑟𝑘𝑙 ,                                                      (4)

        According to Schroeter et al. (2008), it might be interesting to promote the acquisition of
healthy foods by subsidizing their prices. For two types of food, l=A, B, where 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑙𝐴 > 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑙𝐵 , It is
expected that the percentage change in BMI resulting from the change in the consumption of foods
with a high caloric content will be higher (𝑒𝐻𝑞𝐴 > 𝑒𝐻𝑞𝐵 ), in addition to 𝑒𝐻𝑞𝑗 > 0, defined in (4), for
all goods j. If the price reduction is to be effective, then 𝑒𝐻𝑝𝐵 > 0, that is, a negative variation in the
price of B will also cause a reduction in the BMI. Contrary to taxation, one can consider that:
 𝑒𝐻𝑞𝐴
(𝑒         ) 𝑒𝐴𝐵 > |𝑒𝐵𝐵 |,                                                                            (5)
     𝐻𝑞𝐵
        As 𝑒𝐻𝑞𝐴 > 𝑒𝐻𝑞𝐵 , to satisfy this inequality, the goods must be substitutes (𝑒𝐴𝐵 > 0). Thus, a
reduction of calories acquired from the relatively caloric good is incentivized and, with that, the BMI
will reduce. The lower the own price-elasticity of B itself and the greater the relation and substitution
with caloric foods, the more effective the subsidization will be. Therefore, the relationship of
substitutability between high and low-calorie foods is crucial if price changes are to be effective in
bringing about changes in nutritional status. The relative efficacy will depend of the magnitude of the
own and cross price elasticities of demand (SCHROETER et al., 2008).

3. Methodology
   3.1. Individual caloric intake estimation from household consumption and demand system
        estimation

       As an alternative to analyze the distribution of food among household members, Chesher
(1997; 1998) proposes a method in which it is possible to identify and estimate food consumption on
an individual basis from the available information in any unit of measurement (calories, kilograms or
nutrients). Based in the author, I estimate the individual consumption with the relationship between
the household food consumption per capita and individual and household characteristics. Let 𝑞̅𝑘 the
average food supply in household k and the inequality intrahousehold allocation, I considered:
𝑞̅𝑘 = 𝑞𝑖𝑘 + 𝜃𝑖𝑘 = 𝑞̂𝑖𝑘 + 𝑢𝑖𝑘 + 𝜃𝑖𝑘 ,                                                             (6)


                                                                                                            4
where 𝑞𝑖𝑘 is the real food consumption of individual i in household k. If the consumption is less than
the 𝑞̅𝑘 , so 𝜃𝑖𝑘 > 0. We can consider that the quantity observed by everyone, 𝑞𝑖𝑘 , is equivalent to the
average rate of intake by age-gender and characteristics that influence the intrahousehold food
allocation, in addition to deviations in that average for everyone, 𝑢𝑖𝑘 . These characteristics allow to
predict 𝑞̂𝑖𝑘 , that express the food quantity destined to individual i and the𝑢𝑖𝑘 is the non-observed
preferences, that deviate the individual food consumption total in this average. 𝑞̂𝑖𝑘 can be represented
by a function multiplicative separate between individuals and household characteristics, 𝑔(𝑥𝑖𝑘 , 𝑧𝑘 ) =
 𝑔(𝑥𝑖𝑘 )𝑧(𝑧𝑘 ), where:
𝑞̂𝑖𝑘 = 𝑔(𝑥𝑖𝑘 , 𝑧𝑘 ) = [∑2𝑔=1 ∑𝐴=𝑚𝑎𝑥
                               𝑎=1   1(𝑥1 𝑖𝑘 = 𝑎, 𝑥 2 𝑖𝑘 = 𝑔) 𝑏𝑖 𝛽𝑎𝑔 ]exp(𝑍 ′ 𝜏),                   (7)

𝑥1 𝑖𝑘 and 𝑥 2 𝑖𝑘 represents the age and gender, 1(𝑥1 𝑖𝑘 = 𝑎, 𝑥 2 𝑖𝑘 = 𝑔) is an indicator function. The
consumption average rate by age-gender is 𝛽𝑎𝑔 . As the observed consumption corresponds to the
supply of food only at home, the estimated rate will be a portion 𝑏𝑖 of which would correspond to the
total value. Due to the discrete age distribution, smoothed estimation is applied at all ages 2. Chesher
(1997) considers total home acquisition. However, based on (6) and if the heterogeneities that
influence the household allocation are captured in the vector of household characteristics z, it is
estimated (7), considering the household caloric acquisition per capita, in relation to interaction age-
gender dummies. With this, 𝑞̂𝑖𝑘 is expressed by the predicted value of the estimation for everyone.
        The individual consumption estimate is utilized in the health production function, to obtain
the relationship between the BMI and the calorie consumption. The procedure also applies to the
quantities of each food categories considered in the demand system, to obtain the price elasticities.
For this, I estimate the demand system using the QUAIDS model of Banks et al. (1997), corrected
for the problem of null expenses, according to Shonkwiler and Yen (1999). Thus, the estimation of a
system of equations for l goods was proposed, based in the following specification:
                                                                      𝑚           𝜆         𝑚        2

                                                                    ) + 𝑏(𝑝)        𝑖𝑘𝑡𝑙

where, 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑘𝑡 is the portion of expenditure in the l-th good, by i-th individual; 𝑚𝑖𝑘𝑡𝑙 represents total
expenditure3; 𝑎(𝑝) is a price index4;and 𝑝𝑗𝑘𝑡 is the price of the j-th good. The QUAIDS model is
similar to the AIDS, but considers the parameter 𝜆𝑖 , in reference to the impact of the quadratic term
                                                                                          𝛽

maintain system integrability; 𝐷𝑘 is a vector of variables which can characterize the eating habits of
family and individuals and 𝜃𝑙 is a vector of associated parameters, which indicate the effect of each
variable. The density function of 𝜙(𝑧′𝑖𝑘𝑡𝑙 𝛼̂𝑙 ) and the cumulative distribution function Φ(𝑧 ′ 𝑖𝑘𝑡𝑙 𝑎̂𝑙 ) are
obtained by estimating a binary choice model (Probit). Equation (8) is estimated by means of a
seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The procedures of Blundell and Robin (1999) and Deaton
(1988) are used to correct the endogeneity of expenditure and unit values, respectively.

 . The energy and nutrients demand varies in a complex way throughout the life cycle, increasing rapidly between
childhood and adulthood and, depending on the level of activity, declines in old age. In addition, food preferences may
also vary throughout the life cycle. Estimation with age smoothing is important to produce a good adjustment of data and
curves without much local variation. Thus, we find a parameter of penalty, considering some values in the estimates of
the caloric acquisition by age, for each gender separately and we choose the one that minimizes the local variation
(CHESHER, 1997; MIQUEL, LASNEY, 2001; DE AGOSTINI, 2005). I use the penalty parameter λ = 100, as used in
Chesher (1997, 1998) and De Agostini (2005), we can see curves without much variation for both genres. Therefore, this
will be the value adopted as a penalty parameter.

  I use total expenditure on n goods in the 2nd stage demand equations, as it preserves the restriction of the additivity, and
allows for budget separability (DEATON, MUELLBAUER, 1980a).

  As the AIDS price index is not linear in its parameters, Deaton and Muellbauer (1980b) suggest the Stone index, to
obtain a linear model. However, Moschini (1995) proves that this index is not invariant to changes in prices and quantities,
and suggests the corrected Stone index and the Laspeyres index as substitutes.
                                                                                                                              5

we correct the variance-covariance matrix by bootstrapping to minimize the inefficiency of the
estimators. This method consists of an alternative to obtain asymptotic approximations of standard
errors and confidence intervals (PAN; JENSEN, 2008; SAM; ZHENG, 2010).

observed (𝜉𝑖𝑘𝑡 ): calories expenditure, health cares, metabolic shocks and genetic. In absence of true
caloric intake, we have (BONNET et al., 2008):
𝐵𝑀𝐼𝑖𝑘 = 𝜂 + 𝜇𝑞̂ 𝑖𝑘 + 𝜇𝑢𝑖𝑘 + 𝜉𝑖𝑘 ,                                                                  (10)

where 𝜉𝑖𝑘𝑡 is an independent shock, 𝑞̂ 𝑖𝑘 is the estimated calories intake and 𝜇 is the real calories effect
on the BMI. So:
       𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝐼𝑀𝐶𝑖𝑘𝑡 ,𝑞̂ 𝑖𝑘𝑡 )         𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑞̂ 𝑖𝑘𝑡 ,𝑢𝑖𝑘𝑡 )       𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑞̂ 𝑖𝑘𝑡 ,𝜉𝑖𝑘𝑡 )
𝜇̂ =                          =𝜇+                        +                     ,                       (11)

        The 𝑢𝑖𝑘 is the individual preferences. So, an individual may have food consumption habits
different from other individuals with the same age-gender. Thus, these preferences are independent
of their characteristics and are not correlated with the caloric intake rate 𝑞̂ 𝑖𝑘 . Food intake by children
depend on the household choices, represented by the variables contained in the 𝑧𝑖𝑘 vector, used to
estimate the caloric intake rate. However, 𝜉𝑖𝑘 contains unobserved caloric expenditure, which has a
relationship of complementarity with caloric consumption, in addition to being influenced by
individual characteristics. Other factors related to health care may also influence BMI and food
intake, contributing to increase the bias in (11). Thus, I use proxies, related to healthier life habits,
that can characterize the endowment of health of individuals.
        Following Behrman and Deolalikar (1988), its important the inclusion of variables that
reflects children health investments and cares, such as mother characteristics. This program requires
its beneficiaries to provide medical follow-up of children, as well as guidelines and information on
better eating patterns. In addition, the caloric intake rate is based on household data, requiring a
variable that expresses food away-home consumptions. These two sources of food consumption have
a substitution relationship and, together, are determinants of nutritional status. Thus, ignoring the
effect of food away home may underestimate the effect of estimated caloric intake.

       3.3. Database and variables

        I use the microdata of the a Brazilian family budget survey (POF), a sample survey conducted
by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Two surveys are considered at two
points in time: 2002/2003 and 2008/2009, with a sample of 48,568 and 55,970 households,
respectively, (IBGE, 2006b; IBGE, 2010d). In both surveys, information on the household budget
composition and living conditions of the population is available, in order to measure consumption
structures, expenditures and income, as well as anthropometric information. Household food intake
was defined as the conversion of quantities into kilograms for calories, according to the mean values
specified in the Food Composition Tables, avaliable by IBGE.


                                                                                                          6
         As the database on individual consumption does not include individuals under 10 years old, I
use the household acquisition disaggregation, suggested by Chesher (1997). The variables used in the
individual consumption estimates were chosen according to Chesher (1997) and their statistics are
presented in Table 1, for the complete sample. The estimation with the complete sample, for the two
periods, is necessary to guarantee variability of the predicted values. Table 2 presents the descriptive
statistics of health production function variables.

        I characterize the food away-from-home by dummies which identify the food consumption at
school: Provided by the school or purchased. I disregard the household food consumed at school,
since this is already included in the variable individual consumption estimate. The individual food
consumption by categories is also estimated by the equation (6). The foods are aggregate in 14
categories and the unit values are obtained by linear aggregation 𝑈𝑉𝑟𝑘𝑡 = ∑𝐿𝑙(𝑤𝑙𝑘𝑡 𝑈𝑉𝑙𝑘𝑡 ), r=1,...,14. I
consider the amount pay on household is the same between the residents, and I obtain the category
expenditure by the individual consumption estimate and the unity value for the lth category. I estimate
the demand system by l-1 goods (YEN et al., 2003) and consider the category Other foods as residual
good. In the demand system, the variables that represent the characteristics of the mother were also
included as controls: (if she is responsible for the household, if she is obese and its education level),

and if the household is urban and if the responsible considers that the food consumed at home are
always of the preferred type.

4. Results and discussion

        Table 3 presents the estimated individual caloric intake averages, for the total sample, and by
age groups. For comparison, the first column corresponds to observed consumption, available in the
POF 2008/2009 survey on individual consumption. In the second column, I present the individual
consumption estimate based on total household food acquisitions, as in Chesher (1997) and the third
column, I present the estimation, based in per capita household consumption, as in equations (6). It
was seen that the estimates using per capita household intake approximate observed consumption
(equation 6), while the use of total household intake, as in Chesher (1997), underestimates the
consumption of individuals under the age of 18 years. The individual consumption contained in the
database of the survey are based on individual statements of what was consumed in two non-
consecutive days. According to the author, this type of information could contain some bias, because
is more susceptible to measurement errors than a disaggregation of the registry of food acquisitions
at home. That could explain the differences in the standard deviations of the three measures presented.
Following the same strategy of disaggregation of total household calorie acquisition, I estimate the
intake rate (weekly) by age-gender and household characteristics for calories from the food categories
analyzed. Due to the excessive number of tables, it was decided not to present the estimates of the
function in (6), for per capita and for categories consumption.

       Following the same strategy of total home caloric acquisition, I estimate the individual calorie
consumption (weekly) from food categories. Table 4 shows the average per capita consumption,
which reflects the food supply at home, compared to the quantities per adult equivalent 5 and the
estimated individual caloric consumption, for each age group. The measures that do not consider the
age composition of the household, are not very informative about the allocation of food among its
members. In the first case, the consumption per capita does not consider the composition of the
household, while the second, is a measure in terms of a referential individual. The disaggregation
proposed in subsection 3.1 allowed to visualize the average distribution of calories, according to
gender, age and household characteristics.

        In the Table 4 results, I report the individual consumption provides of the household food
consumption. These individual consumption averages are likely to be even greater for young people
and adults, since food away from home has become a convenient option for individuals who work
and study, associated with the opportunity cost between working and preparing their own food (PAN;
JENSEN, 2008). This also explains the fact that means for the last age group (above 60 years old) is
higher in almost all categories, since the food consumption of the elderly is predominantly at home.

on caloric reference consumption (2000 kcal / day). If the individual's caloric intake is greater than
this value, the recommended portions will also be proportionally larger. Thus, the recommended
caloric intake will be the same for all individuals. For each food group mentioned, the following
reference participations are made: 45% of cereals and derivatives, tubers and roots; 2.8% of beans;
10.5% of fruits and natural juices; 2.3% of vegetables; 18% milk and milk products; 9.5% of meat
and eggs. As for oils and fats, in addition to sweets and sugars (including soft drinks), the proportion
in the diet should not exceed 3.7% and 5.5% of the total calories, respectively. Graph 1 shows the
participation in the total of calories at home, for children analyzed, living in poor households,
compared to those in other income level. Both groups present an inappropriate pattern of food
consumption, but it is possible to observe disparities in consumption, since children in a vulnerable
economic situation are more distant from the recommended levels, and interventions are needed to
help reverse this situation.

        Table 5 shows the health production function estimate. About the variables that represent the
food consumption, the BMI effect of individual calorie consumption is 0.0016 (column OLS 4), after
controlling for child and mother characteristics, that is, the increase in 100 kcal in the child diet,
increase the BMI in 0.16 kg/m².
        The distinction between price elasticities at home and individual price elasticities is important
for policies that aim to reduce overweight tax, since this problem can differentiate between members.
In addition, the total consumed by members of a household may be different, making analyzes based
on the average per capita or per adult-equivalent small informative about the effects of changes in
socioeconomic variables (DEATON, 1997). Thus, in the same household, the quantity consumed may
not suffer the same variation among its members, give a price variation. Estimates of individual
elasticities are needed to show how these changes contribute to reducing / increasing the acquisition
                                                                                                      10
of certain foods, taking into consideration how these changes influence household allocation. To
verify reductions in the prices of healthier foods for children’s food purchases, this section is intended
to present the food-price elasticities and the BMI-price elasticities, based on the estimated caloric
acquisition rates.
         The impact on the quantity of each category that is destined for the children is shown in Table
6, in the form of own and cross-price elasticities, calculated based on equation (18), in average. By
the delta method, the standard deviations were found, allowing statistical inference on all results. Due
to the assumption of weak separability, comparisons are made only among the categories considered.
Goods can be classified, according to Marshallian price elasticities, as gross complements when the
increase in the price of the good j reduces the quantity demanded of the good l and gross substitutes
when this increase raises the quantity demanded. In 182 cross-relationships presented in Table 6, only
half were significant at 10% significance level, with 48% of the significant relationships being of
complementary and 52% of substitution. Even though they are significant, the magnitudes found are
low, indicating that changes in relative prices will not generate changes in children consumption food.
This can be not interesting, as such behavior reflects the issue of the possibility of buying from poorer
consumers. In fact, a change in prices may not be enough to get other goods. In the case of
complementary goods, if prices are relatively high, joint purchasing is impossible, given the income
restriction of these families.

         Some healthy foods are inelastic, which would make the application of a thin subsidy
ineffective. Nevertheless, if the reduction affects one or more food groups, it is also necessary to
verify how the demand for a given good behaves given the variation in the price of other goods. When
analyzing the effectiveness of any policy that proposes changes in food prices, the impact on other
categories should be verified. Depending on the policy, the amount of expenditure allocated to each
group will also change, so that spending on infant feeding will be reallocated in response to changes
in relative prices (SCHROETER et al., 2008). So, I calculate the thin subsidies effects on the food
average quantity destined to child (Table 7) . Based on the estimated elasticities, I simulate the thin
subsidies effects on the prices of categories that contain foods considered to be healthy: Cereals
(including legumes and roots), Vegetables, Fruits, Fish and Milk, on the total quantity of each
category analyzed (Table 7). Scenarios based on a 20% price reduction are proposed, in addition to
the combination of subsidies for Fruits and Vegetables and all healthy categories (except Cereals),
which has low participation in the food consumption of the analyzed individuals. Despite the few
significant relationships, healthy foods (Cereals, Vegetables, Fruits, Milk and Yogurts) have a
predominance of complementary relationships. That is, a subsidy on the price of these foods can
contribute to increase the quantity of other foods, contributing to a more varied diet, especially due
to the existence of complementary healthy foods.
         For Cereals, that it is essential to diets of poor children, since it is complementary to most
categories. A reduction in its price would also contribute to increase consumption of vegetables,
fruits, chicken and fish. However, it would also contribute to the consumption of Sweet foods and
contribute in a small way to reduce the acquisition of Pasta, which would be its main substitute in
terms of carbohydrate acquisition.
         As for the other foods considered essential for children's health and development, I highlight
the relationship between the price of Fruits and the quantity demanded of Vegetables and Chicken,
which classify them as complementary. This is important to improve food consumption through
subsidies, since the fall in their price will encourage not only more than a proportional consumption
variation in the quantity of fruit, but also increase consumption of other healthy foods. It is also
important to note that the reduction in the price of fish can not only encourage its acquisition, but also
discourages consumption of processed meats, since they are substitutes. This impact reflects the
importance of subsidizing healthier protein sources, such as encouraging consumers to quit foods that
contain this nutrient, but also others that are harmful to health. Although the share of fish in the infant
diet is low, following the household pattern (Table 8), the reduction in its price for those families that
consumes it results in an extra resource to purchase Fruits, Chicken and Milk. It also appears that the
subsidy given to the Milk category helps to reduce the consumption of Sweets. Probably, this
relationship is due to the inclusion of yogurts in the first category, which may be a healthier snack
option for children, than the items included in the Sweets category. However, giving a 20% discount
on the price of Milk, purchased at home, also increases the purchase of Soft Drinks by 2.30%.
         The last column of Table 7 shows the importance of jointly subsidizing these foods, showing
a favorable scenario to promote a change in the pattern of children's caloric intake, contributing to a
more diversified diet. I highlight how a joint reduction in the prices of these foods by 20%, besides
generating a proportional increase in their own quantities, contributes significantly to the reduction
of Pasta (-4.7%) and Sweet foods (-8.2%). Despite the magnitude of this impact, it is emphasized that
these categories are part of child consumption and should be discouraged.
         With the estimated coefficient for this BMI-calorie (Table 8), considering the average points
of BMI distribution and infant food consumption, we can say that the 1% increase in calories acquired
at home by 1% increases BMI in 0.12%. From the expression in (3), the sensitivity of the analyzed
nutritional status indicator is calculated, given 1% price changes in each category. These elasticities
are presented in Table 7, as well as the participation in each category in the total caloric intake and
total calorie variation. I should be noted that these variations are calculated based on the participation,
according to equation (4).


                                                                                                        13
        According Schroeter et al. (2008), we expect that, for foods that want to stimulate
consumption, the price elasticity of BMI should be positive. Thus, thin subsidies could also contribute
to maintaining that index within what is acceptable. In the case of Vegetables, even though it is a low-
calorie food, the elasticity of BMI in relation to the price of that category was equivalent to -0.003,
implying that a 20% discount on its price could increase the index by 0.06%. Similar impact is
perceived in relation to Milk, whose subsidy would increase the average infant BMI by 0.1%. The
reduction in the price of fruits and fish has proved effective in change the nutritional status. Given a
20% price reduction of these goods, the average BMI falls by 0.06% and 0.18%, respectively.
Once the effects cancel out, a combined discount given of the prices of Fruits and Vegetables and of
a healthy food basket, in addition to not being able to change the standard food consumption of poor
children, is also not interesting to avoid the growing cases of overweight in this age group, given that
the elasticity in the mean is not statistically significant. The scenario that proposes 20% subsidies to
foods essential to the children's diet, while promoting variability, does not modify the total caloric
intake. So, this intervention does not reverse the process of growth of the average BMI of
economically vulnerable children and, consequently, it does not reduce the incidence of childhood
obesity. Thus, the policy generates a trade-off between variability in consumption and maintenance
of nutritional status, on average. Table 8 also presents the BMI elasticities for unhealthy foods. For
these foods, a subside policy would be effective in reducing the average BMI (because the negative
signals), but it should be implemented with caution, so as not to discourage the consumption of foods
that have a relation of complementarity with the taxed good.
        Despite the low magnitude of the effects, which would signal the poor efficacy of changes in
food prices on child nutritional status, the results corroborate with the analyzes in the literature
(SCHROETER et al., 2008; FANTUZZI, 2010). In Fletcher et al. (2010), for example, showed that
the effect of taxing soft drinks on the consumption and BMI of children and adolescents on calories
is small and without significant influence on BMI (-0.01%), considering the effects of substitution
between other beverages (milk, for example). For the public under analysis, the effects are still lower
for most categories, due to the concentration of the food pattern in a few categories, which makes
price changes ineffective to generate a significant change in the quantity acquired and, consequently,
in the BMI. It is worth noting that the magnitudes of the cross-price elasticities are low, implying that
changes in prices will not be enough to promote changes in the food pattern.
        In fact, since food prices are the main determinants of consumer decision-making, thin
subsidies may directly contribute to significant changes in the food consumption pattern, even if the
combined changes in nutritional status are insignificant. This would be their advantage over income
transfer policies, especially for the sample analyzed, which presents standards below the
recommendations of the public health agencies due to insufficient income, which limits their choices.
A price discount may be more effective by directly stimulating consumption of the subsidized basket.
This corroborates with the results of Hidrobo et al. (2014) which, through a random distribution of
coupons, found an improvement in the quantity and quality of the food purchased by the beneficiaries.

5. Conclusions

        The pattern of food consumption in households is one of the main factors responsible for the
early incidence of chronic noncommunicable diseases and the growth of cases of childhood obesity,
making specific analyzes necessary to guide policy interventions to reverse this situation, as well as
to encourage new habits food. In this sense, this paper analyzed how intervention in healthy food
prices (thin subsidies) affects the amount of food in the household, allocated to children. I restricted
the sample to households in poverty, since the participation of their children's healthy foods is more
distant from the recommended levels.
        Since it is not possible to observe data on the food intake of children under 10 years old in the
database, I obtained the individualized estimates of calories from household aggregate. Thus, I can
predict the total calorie consumption and by food categories among age groups. In addition, obtaining
estimates of food consumption allowed the estimation of an individual demand system, specific for
children aged between 2 and 9 years old, whose quantities allocated to these individuals are the result
of a maximization process of the welfare of the person responsible by the child, who makes this
decision, under the influence of several socioeconomic variables. That is, changes in these variables
lead the responsible to change how much food will be allocated to the child, impacting on their
nutritional status.
        Considering the socioeconomic variables that influence this process, the most important are
the prices and income, which constitute the budget constraint and limit the consumption possibilities.
Especially for poor children, it is perceived that the insufficiency of income reduces these possibilities
to a food basket with low variability. From the relationship between BMI and calories and the price
                                                                                                                    16
elasticity demand for food, I simulate the effects of a discount to the healthy food prices on the pattern
of children consumption and nutritional status. The low magnitude of the price impact indicates that
changes in food prices have a small influence on the food quantity allocated to children analyzed.
This may be due to income restriction, which does not allow changes in the consumption structure,
even with the gain in purchasing power given by a reduction in food prices. Even so, the thin subsidies
in a healthy food basket are more effective to promote a significant variability of consumption, in
addition to reducing the consumption of processed meats and sweet foods. This is due to substitution
relations between these and healthy foods, indicating that healthy dietary habits are not practiced
because they are relatively more costly to these consumers. Nevertheless, the BMI effects is not
significative.
        The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of these policies in terms of
outcomes. However, it is also in the interest of a policy maker to compare these interventions in terms
of cost. That is, it would be interesting to investigate whether government expenditures with the
distribution of discount coupons for economically vulnerable families and the transfer to the retail
would be relatively cheaper and viable than the income transfer policy. It is worth mentioning that
the present analysis is static, reflecting the impact of what is consumed in the period, on average, on
the stock of body mass, which is the result of the habits practiced over time. A dynamic analysis
would contribute to verify the role of the analyzed policies on the formation of new habits and their
influence on this stock. It is also suggested, as future research, the disaggregation of household food
consumption, according to nutritional composition and to verify how these interventions also
influence the acquisition of nutrients by the children.
