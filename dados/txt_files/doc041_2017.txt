Abstract
We test for the presence of three types of rational bubbles in the BRICS exchange rates
against the US dollar. For the fundamental value of the exchange rate, we use two structural
specifications: the exchange rate defined by the pure PPP rule, and by a PPP rule adjusted
for the interest rate differential between the two countries. For the bubble dynamics, we
consider explosive bubbles, periodically collapsing bubbles and intrinsic bubbles. We find
evidence consistent with of the presence of at least one of these bubbles for each country
in the group, except for South Africa, confirming the results of other periodically recurring
bubble tests for this dataset.

1. INTRODUCTION
        Rational bubbles are present in asset prices when they deviate from their
fundamental values, which is determined by the fundamental economic factors driving their
long term behavior, which is derived from a partial or general equilibrium model. It is
important to detect their presence and understand their behavior because they may distort
agents' decisions, as shown by Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013), or lead to economic
fluctuations, recessions, and financial crisis when the bubble bursts, as exemplified by
Kindlerberg and Aliber (2005).
        The model for the fundamental value must be based on the principles of profit and/or
utility maximization, inter-temporal budget balance, the risk-return tradeoff characterized by
the CAPM (capital asset pricing model) in one of its versions, and the inexistence of riskless
arbitrage opportunities. The exogenous variables which appear in the fundamental price
model are called the fundamentals.
        The theory of such phenomena started with Blanchard (1979), that showed rational
decision making in a stochastic dynamic environment can produce rational bubbles that
display an explosive behavior. Blanchard and Watson (1982) generalize that model and
consider a specification that allows for an exogenous probability of the bubble collapsing.
Several tests for explosive bubbles were proposed by them, and several other have been
proposed since then and applied to a number of different asset markets, as surveyed by
Brunnermeier (2008). Flood and Garber (1980) perform some the first tests for the presence
of deterministic bubbles in prices, using the framework of the Cagan (1956) model of the
German hyperinflation, and conclude that there is no evidence of the presence of bubbles.
Diba and Grossman (1984) propose the use of stationarity tests to reject the presence of
explosive bubbles. Diba and Grossman (1988) apply such tests to stock prices using a
model that considers allows for the presence of unobservable variables among the
fundamentals. Froot e Obstfeld (1991) argue for the use of intrinsic bubbles, i.e. bubbles
where all of their variability is derived from exogenous economic fundamentals and not from
extraneous factors nor expectations of long run arbitrage, and apply it to modeling stock
market prices. They claim it is a more plausible empirical account of deviations from present-
value pricing than that of the earlier types of rational bubbles.
        Evans (1991) developed a model where bubbles that collapse periodically which
avoids the theoretical restrictions of Blanchard (1979) whereby rational bubbles cannot be
negative and, once they emerge they must burst and eventually disappear. Whenever the
bubble exceeds a certain value, it enters into a regime that shifts its behavior between two
trajectories: it can either grow faster, or it can collapse and revert to the mean. He shows
that the tests developed by Diba and Grossman (1984) are unable to detect the presence
of this class of rational bubbles. Van Norden and Schaller (1993) propose an alternative to
Evans' specification, where the probability of the regime switch is a function of the size of
the bubble, rather than being fixed, and where the regime is unobservable. They apply their
model to a sample of stock exchange returns, and are unable to reject the hypothesis that
bubbles are present. Bohl (2003) tests for the presence of Evans bubbles in a sample of the
US stock market index using the momentum threshold autoregressive (MTAR) model
proposed by Enders and Siklos (2001), and is unable to reject their presence.
        Periodically collapsing bubbles have been used to model exchange rates series. Van
Norden (1996) specifies a particular probabilistic model for the regime change and for the
size of the bubble in each regime and tests for the presence of speculative bubbles in the
exchange rates of Canada, Japan and Germany against the US dollar from 1977 to 1991.
He uses the long term exchange rate from a modified PPP model as the fundamental and
use an exogenous value to anchor its level. Maldonado, Tourinho and Valli (2012) extend
that model by using a non-linear specification for the size of the bubble in the survival regime
and allowing the endogenous determination of the fundamental value level. One advantage
                                                                                              2
of the extended model is that it allows the rationality in the formation of expectations in the
foreign exchange market to be tested.
        The BRICS countries group (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) is often
singled out for special consideration in the set of emerging market economies because of
the size and importance of the countries that compose it, and because they are at a roughly
similar stage of economic development. Also, economic crisis in the countries of the group
display some correlation, which can be assessed by examining episodes in stock and
foreign exchange markets where these asset prices display bubble-like behavior. This can
be done by estimating regime-switching bubbles or by using semi-parametric testing
procedures. An example of the first approach Maldonado, Tourinho and Abreu (2016), that
use the Maldonado, Tourinho and Valli (2012) methodology to model to the exchange rates
to the BRICS against the US dollar, and find that the model passes most of the standard
specification tests for each country, yielding evidence of the presence of rational bubbles in
all of them. They also explore the existence of regularities spanning all the countries in the
group regarding the timing of the inception and collapse of bubbles by testing for
cointegration between the relative (proportional) bubbles in the exchange rates, and
estimate a vector error correction model (VEC) that captures the interaction between them.
They find evidence of cointegration, and argue this means that there is transmission of
shocks between the foreign exchange markets for the currency of these countries.
        This paper tests the presence of other types of bubbles in the exchange rates of
BRICS countries: Blanchard's (1979) explosive bubbles, Froot e Obstfeld (1991) intrinsic
bubbles, and Evans (1991) bubbles periodically collapsing bubbles. The paper proceeds as
follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical specification of the three types of rational
bubbles considered here, section 3 presents the data, and section 4 discusses the
estimation and tests of the models. We present the conclusions in section 5.

2. THREE TYPES OF SPECULATIVE BUBBLES
        As discussed above, the bubble is the difference between the observed exchange
rate and its fundamental value. A test for the presence of bubbles in the time series for the
price of a given asset is in fact a joint test of the presence of the specified bubble and of a
particular model for the fundamental (long run) value of the asset. Here, since we are
interested in exchange rates, we adopt the simplest and most universal model for the long
term interest rate, namely, Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). This approach is also adopted
in many other studies, and finds its empirical support in an extensive literature. In particular,
we consider here two of the three models proposed by Maldonado, Tourinho and Valli
(2012), and also used in Maldonado, Tourinho and Abreu (2016). They rationalize the use
of pure PPP by requiring the absence of riskless arbitrage opportunities for firms operating
in the foreign exchange market. They further extend that model to derive an extended PPP
rule which takes into consideration the interest rate differentials between the home and
foreign country. This is done by extending their model to take into consideration that the
firm, in setting up the arbitrage portfolio, may have the opportunity to borrow funds. These
two rules can be formalized as follows. 1

      The fundamental value of the pure PPP model, denoted 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 , is given by:
                                    (1)      𝐼𝑃𝐷𝑡          (1)
                               𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 = 𝑘1 (       ) = 𝑘1 𝐼𝑡                                (1)
                                             𝐼𝑃𝐹𝑡
where 𝐼𝑃𝐷𝑡 and 𝐼𝑃𝐹𝑡 are, respectively, the domestic and foreign price indices, and 𝑘1 is a
normalization constant. In the van Norden model it is determined by the ratio of the exchange
rate and the relative price index at a reference date when he considers a bubble is not

able to identify that parameter. The second model is similar to the first one but adds a
correction for the interest rate differential between the two countries:
                              (2)        𝐼𝑃𝐷𝑡+1 1 + 𝐼𝑅𝐹𝑡          (2)
                        𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 = 𝑘2 (            )(         ) = 𝑘2𝐼t                      (2)
                                         𝐼𝑃𝐹𝑡+1 1 + 𝐼𝑅𝐷𝑡
where 𝐼𝑅𝐹𝑡 e 𝐼𝑅𝐷𝑡 are the foreign and domestic interest rates and the other variables are as
before.
       These fundamental values satisfy the following non-arbitrage condition:
                               (𝑖)                         (𝑖)
                         𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 − 𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 = 𝑎𝐸𝑡 [𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1 − 𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡+1 ]
where 𝑎 ∈ (0,1) is a discount factor. Successive forward substitutions yields:
                                                     (𝑖)    (𝑖)
                                     𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 = 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 + 𝐵𝑡
        (𝑖)                                    (𝑖)
where 𝐵𝑡 = lim 𝑎𝑇 𝐸𝑡 [𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡+𝑇 − 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1 ] . Under regularity conditions for the stochastic
              T→+∞
processes involved in the above expression, it is not difficult to prove that the exchange rate

                                       𝐵𝑡 = 𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 − 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 ,                                 (3)
satisfies the classical explosive bubble equation:
                                               (𝑖)           (𝑖)
                                       𝐸(𝐵𝑡+1 |𝛺𝑡 ) = 𝑎 −1 𝐵𝑡 ,                            (4)
where Ω𝑡 is the information set at 𝑡. Thus, in expected value, the rational bubble will grow
indefinitely over time.

2.1. Explosive Bubbles
The main difficulty in testing for the presence of rational bubbles in series represented by
equation (3) is to decompose the observed price between the bubble and the fundamentals,
since the latter is unobservable. The approach developed by Diba and Grossman (1988)
address this situation and test null hypothesis of presence of explosive bubbles in the price
series (in their case, the stock market index), even when some fundamentals are not
observable. They observe that, over time, prices are expected to move further away from
the asset's fundamental value (equation (4)) and propose the use of unit root tests and
cointegration to test for the presence of explosive bubbles.
       If the price and the fundamental value have a long-term equilibrium relationship, the
presence of explosive bubbles is ruled out. When this does is not the case, it is not possible
to reject the hypothesis that bubbles are present in the series. However, it is not possible to
state that they are present, since the absence of a long-term relation can be due to other
factors (for example, it can be due to the non-stationarity of the fundamental).

2.2. Periodically Collapsing Bubbles
Several models of periodically collapsing bubbles are available in the literature, as indicated
earlier. For exchange rates, one of the most successful is the van Norden (1996) model
which is based in a dynamics characterized by the occurrence of non-observable events
(collapse and survival of the bubble). An extended version ot that model has been applied
to the exchange rates of BRICS countries in Maldonado, Tourinho and Abreu (2016).
        To better characterize the nature of these differences, and maybe understand better
their implications, we estimate an alternative bubble model which has a sharper dynamic
behavior, and more clearly reflects the change from a mostly stationary phenomenon to an
essentially explosive one. This is the case of the Evans (1991) model, which can be
formalized as:
                                                                                             4
                                        𝐵𝑡+1= (1 + 𝑟 )𝐵𝑡 𝑢𝑡+1                     if 𝐵𝑡 ≤ 𝛼    (5)
                   {                   −1 (
                       𝐵𝑡+1 = [𝛿 + 𝜋      1 + 𝑟 )𝜃𝑡+1 (𝐵𝑡 − (1 + 𝑟 )−1 𝛿 )]𝑢𝑡+1    if 𝐵𝑡 > 𝛼   (6)

where 𝛿 is the constant discount factor, 0 < (1 + 𝑟 )−1 < 1, and 𝛼 is a positive parameter,
such that 0 < 𝛿 < (1 + 𝑟 )𝛼, 𝑢𝑡+1 is an independent and identically distributed positive
random variable with 𝐸𝑡 [𝑢𝑡+1 ] = 1, 𝜃𝑡+1 is an independent and identically Bernoulli random
variable which is equal to 1 with probability 𝜋, and 0 with probability 1 − 𝜋, where 0 < 𝜋 ≤ 1.
Whenever 𝐵𝑡 is smaller than 𝛼, the bubble will grow at the average rate 1 + 𝑟, and the
collapse probability is null. However, after the size of the bubble exceeds 𝛼, the bubble starts
growing faster, at the average rate (1 + 𝑟 )𝜋 −1 and can collapse with a probability (1 − 𝜋 ).
When it does collapse, 𝐵𝑡 does not become null, but rather assumes a small value 𝛿, and
the process restarts.
       The threshold autoregressive model (TAR) and the momentum threshold
autoregressive model (MTAR) developed by Enders and Siklos (2001) can be used to test
for the presence of this type of bubble, as indicated by Bohl (2003) for the case of stock
prices. Applying the same methodology to our exchange series, we estimate the
cointegration relation between the spot exchange rate and the fundamental value divided
by the scaling factor:
                                                (𝑖)                        ( 𝑖)
                          𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡 = 𝛽̂0 + 𝛽̂1 (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 ⁄𝑘𝑖 ) + 𝜇𝑡 = 𝛽̂ 0 + 𝛽̂ 1𝐼𝑡 + 𝜇𝑡 ;            (7)
        (𝑖)                                              (𝑖)
where 𝐼𝑡 is the index associated with the 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 according to equations (1) and (2). The
dynamics of this type of bubbles suggest there is asymmetry of the residuals of the
cointegration regression which can be captured by cumulative deviations 𝜇𝑡 above the
threshold, followed by an abrupt fall to the threshold. This can be detected by estimating the
following error correction model:
                                                                 𝑝−1

                         ∆𝜇𝑡 = Γ𝑡 𝜌1 𝜇𝑡−1 + (1 − Γ𝑡 )𝜌2 𝜇𝑡−1 + ∑ 𝛾𝑖 ∆𝜇𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡 ;               (8)
                                                                 𝑖=1
where the indicator variable Γ𝑡 is defined (for the TAR model) as follows:
                                        Γ𝑡 = 1 𝑖𝑓 𝜇𝑡−1 ≥ 𝜏,                                    (9)
                                        Γ𝑡 = 0 𝑖𝑓 𝜇𝑡−1 < 𝜏,                                   (10)
where 𝜏 represents the threshold value of the cumulative deviations. The MTAR model is
similar to TAR, but the indicator variable is as follows:
                                        Γ𝑡 = 1 𝑖𝑓 ∆𝜇𝑡−1 ≥ 𝜏,                                  (11)
                                        Γ𝑡 = 0 𝑖𝑓 ∆𝜇𝑡−1 < 𝜏,                                  (12)
        According to Enders and Siklos (2001) in many economic applications the value 𝜏 =
0 can be adopted. Alternatively, 𝜏 can be chosen using the methodology in Chan (1993),
which is based on the time series of estimated residuals, as follows. The 15% larger and
smaller valued residuals are discarded, the TAR and MTAR models are estimated for each
of the remaining values, and the threshold which yields the smaller residual sum of squares
is chosen. The models for which the threshold is estimated in this manner are denominated
MTAR-consistent (MTARC) and TAR-consistent (TARC).
        Two hypothesis tests are sequentially performed. First, no-cointegration can be
tested either by testing 𝐻0 : 𝜌1 = 0 and 𝜌2 = 0 with the 𝑡-statistic, or by testing 𝐻0 : 𝜌1 = 𝜌2 =
0, with the 𝜙-statistic, using the critical values provided by Enders and Siklos (2001). If the
no-cointegration hypothesis is rejected, a second test is performed where the null is the
presence of symmetry: 𝐻0 : 𝜌1 = 𝜌2. If the estimate of the coefficient 𝜌̂1 is significantly
different from zero, has a negative sign, and its absolute value is larger than the estimate of
𝜌̂2 , the hypothesis of a symmetrical adjustment is rejected. If both hypothesis (no
                                                                                                 5
cointegration and presence of symmetry) are rejected, the inexistence of periodically
collapsing bubbles is rejected, and their presence is accepted.


2.3. Intrinsic Bubbles
The bubble examples discussed above do not contemplate an interaction between the
bubble and the fundamentals, but there may exist situations where there is reason to believe
such an interaction exists. Froot and Obstfeld (1991) specify a type of rational bubbles, the
intrinsic bubble, where this possibility if modeled in and extreme form by assuming the
bubble is a deterministic function of the fundamentals, and does not depend on extrinsic
factors. For a given (constant) level of fundamentals, the bubble remains constant over time
but, when fundamentals change, an overreaction of asset price may occur. For example, in
their application of this formulation to model the US stock market index, the bubble depends
only on the dividends stream. Following this approach, we assume the fundamental value
   (𝑖)            (𝑖)
(𝑓𝑡 = ln 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 ) follows a random walk with drift:
                                                  (𝑖)           (𝑖)
                                      𝑓𝑡+1 = 𝜇 + 𝑓𝑡 + 𝜉𝑡+1 ,                                         (13)

where 𝜉𝑡+1 ~ 𝑁(0, 𝜎 ). The intrinsic bubble for the exchange rate is then defined by:
                                                                          (𝑖) 𝜆
                                                  𝐵𝑡 = 𝑐 ⋅ (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 )                                  (14)
which must satisfy the fundamental bubble equation (4):
                                                               (𝑖)    𝜆                      (𝑖) 𝜆
                                              𝐸𝑡 [(𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1 ) ] = 𝑎−1 (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 )                        (15)
      For this equantion to be satisfied, the parameter 𝜆 must satisfy certaind conditions.
To see this, recall that equation (13) implies the following:

                          (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡+1 ) = (𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 ) exp{𝜆𝜇 + 𝜆𝜉𝑡+1 }
       Taking the expected value of both sides of this expression above and recalling that
the right-hand side is a log-normal random variable, yields:
                                    (𝑖)       𝜆                 (𝑖) 𝜆               𝜆2 𝜎 2

                                                                                      2
       Substituting for the expectation in equation (15), it is clear that 𝜆 must satisfy the
following quadratic equation (𝜎 2 ⁄2)𝜆2 + 𝜇 𝜆 + ln 𝑎 = 0, which always has a real solution,
since 𝑎 < 1. Therefore, the intrinsic bubble is defined by (14) for that particular value for 𝜆.
Using the definition of the bubble (equation (3)), yields the following equation for the spot
exchange rate:
                                                          (𝑖)                     (𝑖) 𝜆

                                                                          (𝑖)     (𝑖)         (𝑖)
equations (1) and (2), which can be written more concisely as 𝐹𝑈𝑁𝐷𝑡 = 𝑘𝑖 𝐼𝑡 , where 𝐼𝑡
is either the index of relative prices or the index of relative prices adjusted for the interest
rate differential, equation (16) it can be written as:
                                         𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡      (𝑖)           (𝑖) 𝜆−1
                                           (𝑖) = 𝑘     + 𝑐𝑖 ∙ (𝐼𝑡   )                       (17)

where 𝑐𝑖 = 𝑐 (𝑘 (𝑖) ) is a parameter that characterizes the existence of the intrinsic bubble:
it is present only if it is found to be significantly different from zero in the estimation of (17).
It is important to note that it also yields an estimate of 𝑘 (𝑖) , which determines the level of the
fundamental value.
                                                                                                       6
3.        THE DATABASE
To test the model, data is required for the spot (SPOT) and for the fundamental exchange
rates (FUND1 and FUND2) of each of the five BRICS countries against the US dollar. As
indicated earlier, we will test two competing models for the fundamental rate for each
country. Model I, specified by equation (1), assumes that it satisfies the purchasing power
parity (PPP) relation while Model II, specified by equation (2), modifies that relation to
include the interest rates differential between in the country and the US. We use monthly
data, and the time sample varies between countries, as indicated in Table 1, due to data
availability.
                       Table 1: Time sample for each BRICS countries
      Country                        Model I                        Model II

      Russia            July/2005 – August/2016          July/2005 – September/2015
      India             March/1999 – August/2016         March/1999 – July /2015
      China             July/2005 – August/2016          July/2005 – September /2015
      South Africa      March/1999 – August/2016         March/1999 – July /2015

        For China the sample starts at the date when the exchange rate ceased to be pegged
to the US dollar and began fluctuating with respect to a basket of currencies of trade
partners. For Russia the sample starting date was chosen to exclude the period when the
exchange rate band precluded the market determination of the exchange rate.
        The spot exchange rates were obtained from the database of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). To calculate the index for the fundamental rate of Model I, for each
country we used the Producer Price Index (PPI) as the domestic price index and the United
States PPI as an approximate measure of the international price index. The sources of PPI
from China and Russia were National Bureau of Statistics of China e Federal State Statistics
Service - Russian Federation, respectively. To complete the information required for Model
II, we require indicator of the relevant international interest rate and of the domestic interest
rate. For the former we used the sum of the interest rates paid on the T-Bill with four weeks
term, and the Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI+) 2 rate of each country. For India, we
used the JACI (JP Morgan Asia Credit Index) rate as an approximation for EMBI+, which
started being compiled only in 2012. For the latter, we used the interbank market interest
rate of each country for the one month term bond with highest liquidity. The data for these
interest rates are from Reuters, via Datastream.

4. ESTIMATION AND TESTS
Tests were performed to assess the presence of each of the three types of bubbles
described in section 3, in exchange rate series of the BRICS countries currency against the
US dollar.

4.1. Explosive bubbles
       To test for the presence of explosive bubbles, first the ADF (Augmented Dickey-
Fuller), PP (Phillips-Perron) and KPSS (Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin) unit root
tests were performed to check for the presence of a unit root. Then the Johansen and Engle-
Granger cointegration tests between the spot and fundamental rates were used to identify
the existence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between these series.

                                                                                               7
        For all countries, the ADF e PP tests did not reject the presence of unit root for the
SPOT, FUND1 and FUND2 (level) series, and rejected it for their first difference. The KPSS
test rejected the null hypothesis that the (level) series are stationary, but did not reject the
hypothesis that its first difference stationary. Therefore, all the exchange rate series, for all
the countries, were classified as I(1),3 and it was possible to test for cointegration of the spot
and fundamental rates.
        The Engle-Granger cointegration test, using the critical values from MacKinnon
(2010), show (Table 2) that the presence of a unit root in the residuals of the cointegration
relation cannot be ruled out for any country, at a significance level of 5%, and that the
cointegration hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, this test is unable to reject the
hypothesis that bubbles are present in the exchange rate series of all BRICS countries. The
results of the Johansen cointegration test (Table 3 and 4) confirm these results and indicate
the rejection of the cointegration hypothesis for all countries, except for South Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to rule out the presence of explosive bubbles in the exchange
rates of Brazil, Russia, India and China. For South Africa, although the Engle-Granger test
points to no cointegration, Johansen's test results indicate that the series cointegrate and
the presence of explosive bubbles is discarded for that country.

4.2. Evans' Periodically Collapsing Bubbles
       We tested the exchange rates of the BRICS for the presence of bubbles consistent
with the Evans (1991) specification estimating TAR, MTAR, TARC and MTARC models of
equation (8). Here we report only the results for MTAR and MTARC tests, using the critical
values in Enders and Siklos (2001), because Bohl (2003) shows they are more powerful
than the TAR and TARC tests. Recall also that the difference between the MTAR and
MTARC tests is that in the former 𝜏 = 0, while in the latter it is calculated from the series of
estimated residuals. As will be seen below, both tests arrive at the same conclusion for all
countries, except India. Table 5 shows the results of the estimation for each country.

        For Brazil and Russia, both MTAR and MTARC reject the null hypothesis of no
cointegration (H0 : ρ1 = ρ2 = 0) and the hypothesis of symmetry (H0 : ρ1 = ρ2 ) at the 5%
significance level, but the hypothesis of absence of bubbles is not rejected because ρ1 is
positive. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of periodically recurring bubbles.
        For India, MTAR and MTARC report different results. Since our time series is not
long, the estimate of τ for MTARC may not be accurate, because its consistency relies on
asymptotic results. Therefore, it will be more convenient the use of the MTAR test. Using
this method, the hypothesis of no cointegration and symmetry cannot be rejected, so the
hypothesis of no existence of periodically collapsing bubbles cannot be rejected for India
and thus, it is accepted. For China and South Africa the hypothesis of no cointegration and
symmetry cannot be rejected, so the hypothesis of inexistence of periodically collapsing
bubbles cannot be rejected, and is accepted.

4.3. Intrinsic Bubbles
         To test for the presence of intrinsic bubbles in the exchange rate series we fitted the
non-linear equation (17) and obtained the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters
using the methodology in Davidson and MacKinnon (2003) to allow the errors to be AR(1)
i.e. follow a first order auto-regressive process which was detected in a first stage estimation.
         Namely,
                 𝐸𝑋𝑅𝑡                     (𝑖) 𝜆−1
                    (𝑖)   = 𝑘 (𝑖) + 𝑐𝑖 ∙ (𝐼𝑡 )      + 𝑢𝑡 ; 𝑢𝑡 = 𝜌𝑢𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑡 , 𝜖𝑡 ∼ 𝑁𝐼𝐷(0, 𝜎𝜖2 )
                   𝐼𝑡

        The analysis of the statistical significance of each parameter allowed us to test for
the presence of this type of rational bubble. The results are shown in Table 6. We find
significant positive values for 𝑐𝐢 only for Brazil, for both models of the fundamental rate
(FUND1 and FUND2), and for India, for the fundamental rate FUND2. The estimated
parameter 𝜆̂ − 1 was not significant for any of the countries. Therefore, there is evidence of
the presence of intrinsic bubbles only for Brazil and India.

5. CONCLUSIONS
Rational bubbles are present in asset prices when persistent deviations between the
observed price and the fundamental rate which satisfy the fundamental bubble dynamic
equation. This paper tested for the existence of rational bubbles in the exchange rates of
BRICS countries of three particular types: explosive bubbles, periodically collapsing bubbles
of the type proposed by Evans (1991), and intrinsic bubbles proposed by Froot and Obstfeld
(1991).
        Two structural models were used to obtain produce the series for fundamental value
of the exchange rate. One is based on the pure purchasing power parity (PPP) relation and
the other is a modified version of that model that included a term to capture the effects of
the interest differential between the BRICS country and the USA.
        The results of the tests are summarized in Table 7; in the second line it is stated the
null hypothesis that is being tested. In summary, the tests for explosive bubbles does not
reject the existence of them for all countries except South Africa. The no rejection does not
imply the acceptance of existence of explosive bubbles, since other factors may cause the
absence of cointegration. There is no evidence of the presence of periodically collapsing
bubbles of the Evans (1991) type for all the countries in the BRICS group. There is evidence
of intrinsic bubbles only for Brazil, for both models of the fundamental rate (FUND1 and
FUND2), and for India, for FUND 2. Looking at all tests for each country, we conclude that
for Brazil and India there is evidence of the presence of explosive and intrinsic rational
bubbles (they are either not rejected or present in at least one test), for Russia and China
only explosive bubbles might exist and for South Africa there is no evidence of any of these
types of exchange rate bubbles.
