Abstract

This paper examines the relation between geographical and cognitive proximity by applying this
subject to the university-industry collaboration. Previous studies have shown that non-spatial
forms of proximity can substitute for the benefits of geographical proximity because they can
stimulate collaboration and interactive learning between the partners. The paper uses data from
collaboration between university and industry in Brazil and a measure for cognitive proximity
based on correspondence analysis. The main results show that cognitive proximity can substitute
for geographical proximity because shared capabilities and expertise between the collaborating
firm and the academic partner stimulate long distant collaboration. In this way, the results of this
paper provide new empirical evidence about the relation between geographical proximity and a
form of non-spatial proximity. In addition, the results also add a new driver, cognitive proximity,
which affects long-distance university-industry collaboration.

1. Introduction
There is a huge debate in the literature about the role of geographical proximity in
fostering innovation. Several studies have noted that local flows of information and
knowledge sharing play a very important role in interactive learning (Glaeser et al., 1992;
Gertler, 2003; Storper and Venables, 2004). However, recent studies have indicated that
geographical proximity is not a sufficient condition to foster interactive learning because,
by itself, it cannot generate complementarities and synergies that can stimulate interaction
among local actors (Gilly and Torre, 2000; Boschma, 2005; Broekel, 2015). In this way,
geographical proximity can be supplemented by other forms of non-spatial proximity
shaped by, for example, cognitive proximity among actors. Cognitive proximity can be
defined as the similarities in the way actors perceive, interpret, and evaluate new
knowledge, and it implies that actors sharing the same knowledge base are better able to
learn from each other (Noteboom, 2000; Boschma, 2005).
Based on this assumption, the aim of this paper is to examine the relations between
geographical and cognitive proximity in university-industry collaborations. Universities
have been playing an increasing role in fostering innovation, and collaboration between
university and firms is one of the most important channels to transfer new academic
knowledge to industrial R&D. In this way, a dataset of 4,337 collaborations between firms

and academic research groups in Engineering and Agricultural Sciences in Brazil was
used to examine how geographical and cognitive proximities among universities and
industry shape their interactions. In this way, the contribution of this paper is to present
new empirical evidence on the relations between two dimensions of proximity, cognitive
and geographical proximities. In addition, this subject is applied to university-industry
collaborations, which allow us to add new empirical findings regarding the drivers of
geographical distance of collaborating firms and academic research groups. Another
contribution is a new index to measure cognitive proximity.
In order to achieve this aim, the paper is organised into five sections beyond this
introduction. Section two presents the main conceptual background regarding
geographical and non-spatial forms of proximity. Section three provides a brief
description of the data and the main methodological issues, including the way to measure
cognitive proximity, and section four presents the econometric modelling. Section five
presents the results and discusses the main evidence on the effects of the cognitive
proximity in the geographical distance of university-industry collaboration. Finally, the
last section presents concluding remarks and policy implications.



2. Theoretical remarks
2.1. Geographical and cognitive proximity
The main assumption regarding the importance of geographical proximity is that such
proximity facilitates knowledge sharing and, thereby, interactive learning and innovation.
In fact, many authors state that geographical proximity is an important precondition for
knowledge sharing, knowledge transfer and technological acquisition (Gertler, 1995;
Knoben and Oerlemans, 2006; Huber, 2012). The role of tacit knowledge in innovation
is the primary basis for the importance of geographical proximity. Tacit knowledge
requires the existence of linkages among actors, and it is best accumulated through
experience. The relationship between tacit knowledge and context is reflexive because
tacit knowledge both defines and is defined by the social context: tacit knowledge can be
successfully shared between two or more actors only when they also share a common
social context. Tacit knowledge is a primary determinant of the geography of innovation,
and its context-specific nature renders it “spatially sticky” (Gertler, 2003).

Geographical proximity is commonly defined as territorial, spatial, local or physical
proximity. The importance of geographical proximity lies in the fact that small
geographical distances facilitate both planned and serendipitous face-to-face interactions
and therefore foster knowledge sharing and innovation. In this way, geographical
proximity facilitates the exchange of tacit knowledge among actors (Gilly and Torre,
2000; Gertler, 2003). The larger the geographical distance between two actors, the more
difficult tacit knowledge transfer becomes (Knoben and Oerlemans, 2006).
However, recent studies have noted that geographical proximity alone cannot generate
synergies and complementarities, and it is not suffice to generate interactive learning
among local actors (Boschma, 2005; Broekel, 2015). In fact, the spatial dimension can be
supplemented by other forms of non-spatial proximity shaped by organizational, social,
institutional and technological linkages (Paci et al., 2014).



                                                                                          2
Based on this assumption, five dimensions of proximity can be put forward:
organizational, social, institutional, cognitive, and geographical proximity. By analysing
these five dimensions, one can examine whether geographical proximity still plays a role
in interactive learning and innovation, since other dimensions of proximity can also fulfil
this role (Boschma, 2005). If geographical proximity can be assumed to actually facilitate
interactive learning and knowledge sharing, other dimensions of proximity are also
important in strengthening the ways in which actors collaborate.
Organizational proximity can be defined as the extent to which linkages are shared—
within and between—an organizational arrangement; thus, organizational proximity is a
powerful mechanism of coordination, even at long geographical distances, for interactive
learning (Gilly and Torre, 2000; Boschma, 2005; Knoben and Oerlemans, 2006; Fitjar
and Rodrigues-Pose, 2013). Social proximity results from the assumption that economic
relations are embedded in social contexts (Granovetter, 1985; Gertler, 2003), and it could
be a powerful tool for learning. Social relations not only coordinate transactions but also
constitute vehicles that enable knowledge sharing, owing to the existence of mutual trust,
kinship, and experience (Boschma, 2005; Capello and Faggian, 2005; Knoben and
Oerlemans, 2006; Autant-Bernard et al., 2007;). Institutional proximity is commonly
associated with the institutional framework at the macro level, and it facilitates collective
learning because it allows free knowledge transfer among actors based on a common
space of representations, models, norms, procedures, applied rules and action (Boschma,
2005; Knoben and Oerlemans, 2006).
The role of cognitive proximity is primarily related to the assumption that knowledge is
not a public good that is produced outside the economic system (Lissoni, 2001; Giuliani
and Bell, 2005; Capello, 2009). Nevertheless, knowledge creation and innovation are
often cumulative, and such accumulation relies on the capacity of a firm to learn with this
new knowledge. In this way, the tacit and idiosyncratic nature of a firm’s knowledge base
implies that access to relevant knowledge is not a sufficient condition and that the
effective knowledge transfer requires absorptive capacity to identify, interpret and exploit
new knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Nooteboom, 2000; Boschma, 2005).
Complementary absorptive capacity between two partners is required, and overlaps in
actors’ knowledge bases are essential for efficient communication (Broekel, 2015). For
each new technology, a firm must dominate a minimum level of knowledge, under which
it is not able to bridge the knowledge gap, and collaboration requires a minimum level of
cognitive proximity between two actors. Cognitive proximity is commonly defined as the
similarities in the way actors perceive, interpret, and evaluate new knowledge (Knoben
and Oerlemans, 2006) or the degree of overlap in two actors’ knowledge bases (Broekel,
2015). Several authors have mentioned the similarities between cognitive and
technological dimensions of proximity (Breschi et al., 2003; Knoben and Oerlemans,
2006; Krafft et al., 2014)

Relations among the different dimensions of proximity are far from being understood. It
is essential to consider the different types of proximity from a dynamic perspective
because current proximity structures may affect actors’ future collaborations (Balland et
al, 2015; Broekel, 2015). For example, actors who frequently interact are more likely to
become cognitively closer because they can learn more from each other and improve their
communication structures.
Several empirical studies have also examined whether non-spatial forms of proximity can
be a substitute for geographical proximity. The results obtained in a study from the

                                                                                            3
Canadian infection and immunity research networks show that both institutional and
geographical proximities are very important in supporting collaboration. In addition,
institutional proximity can compensate for the lack of geographical proximity to support
collaboration (Lander, 2015). Geographical and cognitive proximity may induce a
process of interactive learning and knowledge dissemination among actors, often without
a conscious decision on the part of the involved actors (Paci et al., 2014). Substitution
effects, in which non-spatial proximity substitute geographical proximity as a tool for
interaction, were empirically found between cognitive and geographical proximity in
collaborative innovation projects in the Danish clean tech industry (Hansen, 2015).
Regarding scientific collaboration, network proximity also alleviates the impeding effects
of geographical distance on collaboration (Bergé, 2016). In addition, studies on industrial
clusters have shown the importance of non-local relations of local producers, supported
by the presence of cognitive proximity among actors (Vale and Caldeira, 2007) or
intermediated by technological gatekeepers (Morrison, 2008; Hervas-Oliver and Albors-
Garrigos, 2014). However, other studies show that, in specific contexts, such as among
small firms, relations between geographical and cognitive proximity could be
complementary in nature because interactions characterized by both geographical and
cognitive proximity are more likely to be realized than linkages characterized by only
geographical proximity (Broekel and Boschma, 2011).
It is important to mention the role of temporary geographical proximity. The increasing
mobility of people, information and goods has reduced the constraints of collaboration at
long geographical distances, since many types of interactions can be fulfilled temporarily
through travel and distant online meetings (Torre and Rallet, 2005). Such collaboration
clearly occurs through the emergence of communities of practice, epistemic communities
or forums of professionals, which enable participants to exchange information and share
knowledge even at long distances (Knoben and Oerlemans, 2006; Maskell et al., 2006;
Torre, 2008; Torre, 2014). In this way, temporary geographical proximity can also be an
important tool for fostering interactions between two actors. It can also be a good, even
though it may not be a perfect substitute of the mechanisms of geographical proximity.
Temporary geographical proximity can also create—and strengthen—cognitive
proximity among actors.
Finally, it is important to mention the “proximity paradox”, which highlights the negative
effects of proximity. In its different dimensions, proximity may also have negative effects
on knowledge sharing and innovation, owing to lock-in and a lack of openness and
flexibility (Boschma, 2005; Boschma and Frenken, 2011). For example, cognitive
proximity can enable communication among actors and thereby foster interactive
learning. However, too much cognitive proximity can be detrimental to innovation and
learning since it not only decreases the potential for learning but also increases the risk of
lock-in and undesirable spillovers to local rivals (Boschma, 2005). Thus, too little
cognitive proximity implies communication problems, while too much cognitive
proximity implies a lack of sources of novelty (Nooteboom, 2000; Cassi and Plunket,
2014). In fact, technological (or cognitive) proximity is the dimension of proximity that
seems to be most subject to the proximity paradox, since previous empirical results show
that higher cognitive proximity decreases innovative performance (Cassi and Plunket,
2014).

2.2. Geographical proximity of university-industry collaboration
The same assumptions regarding the role of geographical proximity in fostering
interactive learning and innovation among actors in general can be applied to university-
industry linkages. Universities have being playing an increasing role in supporting
innovation. Academic research represents an important source of new knowledge, and
collaboration projects with universities can help firms solve their innovation problems,
especially when such problems are closer to the technological frontier (Nelson, 1959;
Klevorick et al., 1995; Cohen et al., 2002). Recently, analyses of university-industry
collaboration have devoted increased attention to the role of geographical proximity
between academic research and industrial R&D, and strong empirical evidence has shown
the benefits associated with university-firm co-location. Previous findings have generally
revealed the existence of geographically bounded spillovers from academic research to
industrial innovation (Jaffe, 1989; Audretsch and Feldman, 1996; Mansfield and Lee,
1996; Anselin et al., 1997; Arundel and Geuna, 2004; Laursen et al., 2011; D’Este and
Iammarino, 2010; Garcia et al., 2013; De Fuentes and Dutrénit, 2014).
Although firms often prefer to collaborate with geographically close universities, certain
factors can induce firms to collaborate with universities in geographically distant
locations (D’Este and Iammarino, 2010; Laursen et al., 2011; Muscio, 2013; De Fuentes
and Dutrénit, 2014; Garcia et al., 2015). Normally, if a firm requires unique, complex,
and tacit knowledge, it will seek out a university that can solve its innovative problems
regardless of the geographical location of the university. The main factor that affects firm
collaboration with geographically distant universities is the firm’s absorptive capacity.
Firms with high absorptive capacity have a greater range of potential academic partners;
therefore, they are able to search for and find academic partners beyond their
geographically proximate environment (Laursen et al., 2011; Garcia et al., 2015). In
addition, the quality of the university is another factor that affects the geographical
distance of university-industry collaborations. High quality universities are able to attract
geographically distant firms to collaborate, since top research groups can master a broad
and complex set of capabilities that can help firms solve their innovative problems,
especially when firms require state-of-the-art knowledge (D’Este and Iammarino, 2010;
Muscio, 2013; Garcia et al., 2015).

Increasing attention has been devoted to the examination of the main factors that affect
the geographical distance of university-industry collaboration. Previous studies have
identified the factors that encourage firms to search for geographically distant universities
for collaboration. However, no study has considered the different dimensions of
proximity as factors that affect firms’ decision to collaborate with geographically distant
universities.


3. Data and methodology

3.1. Database
The main database used to examine the relation between geographical and cognitive
proximity provides basic information on university-industry linkages in Brazil. The data
were gathered from the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology by exploiting the
CNPq Directory of Research Groups of the Lattes platform. This database provides a
broad set of data on the activities of academic research groups in Brazil and covers their

                                                                                            5
main features, such as scientific field, number of researchers, research performance, and
collaborating firms. Information on the collaborating firms from the Brazilian Ministry
of Labour, such as size, industrial sector, localization, and labour force qualification, was
added to these data. The final database includes 4,337 collaborations involving 3,063
firms and 1,738 Engineering and Agrarian Science research groups in 2010 from all
Brazilian regions. Engineering and Agrarian Science are the most important knowledge
fields involving collaboration in Brazil (Suzigan et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 2015).


3.2. Geographical proximity
Geographical proximity was measured as the distance in kilometres in a straight line
between the georeferenced coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the localization (ZIP
code) of the research groups and collaborating firms. The average geographical distance
between research groups and collaborating firms is 316.5 kilometres. Collaborations
occur at a range between 0 and 3,345 kilometres; zero-kilometres collaborations refer to
research groups and firms located in the same ZIP code. A significant number of the
collaborations are co-located, or at short geographical distances: 25% of all collaborations
occur at a distance up to 6.9 kilometres, and half of them occur at up to 82.4 kilometres
(Annex). Furthermore, at the sample level, the frequency of collaboration decreases as
the distance increases (Figure 1).

3.3. The measurement of cognitive proximity
Measuring cognitive proximity is not an easy task (Boschma, 2005). In theoretical terms,
cognitive proximity between two different actors refers to the similarity of their
knowledge bases, and it is linked to the specific pattern of knowledge accumulation.
Therefore, cognitive proximity can facilitate knowledge sharing since actors with similar

                                                                                                  6
knowledge bases and similar levels of absorptive capacity are more able to create specific
channels for interaction. Cognitive proximity can be considered to be greater when the
actors’ knowledge bases are more similar (Nooteboom, 2000; Krafft et al., 2014; Broekel,
2015).
The analysis of this paper relies on university-industry collaboration. In this way, an
empirical measure for the cognitive distance between academic research groups and
collaborating firms was established in order to consider the relationship between
academic scientific fields and sectoral industries. This measure assumes that
collaboration patterns between universities and firms are not randomly distributed. Based
on their main knowledge base, firms in certain industries, which face specific innovative
problems, tend to collaborate more often with research groups from certain scientific
fields, which master a specific set of academic capabilities. This assumption is the basis
for the proposed measure of cognitive proximity between scientific fields and sectoral
industries.
Previous studies have presented several measures of cognitive or technological proximity.
Jaffe (1986; 1989) has proposed an empirical measure for technological proximity as the
proximity of firms’ technology portfolios. In this way, a technological proximity index
was calculated for a pair of technologies as the angular separation or uncentred correlation
of the vectors, and two technologies were considered close if they are regularly used in
combination with the same third technology (Jaffe, 1986; 1989; Colombelli et al, 2014).
Similar approaches were used by considering the index to measure the proximity or
relatedness between two technologies (Breschi et al., 2003; Krafft et al., 2014). It is also
possible to explore patterns of knowledge interactions by analysing matrices of
interaction with the share of interactions for each pair of economic sectors and fields of
science (Shartinger et al, 2002).

The dataset used in this paper covers two different dimensions, which involve 6 categories
of research groups’ scientific fields, namely, Agricultural Sciences, Civil Engineering,
Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Veterinary, and Chemical Engineering;
and 12 sectoral industries, grouped by the firms’ SIC, specified by numbers: Public
Administration, Agriculture, Food Processing, Non-durable Goods, Retail Trade, Electric
and Gas, Electronic Equipment, Mining, Chemicals, Knowledge Intensive Business
Services (KIBS), Metal and Transportation Products, Transportation and Urban
Infrastructure. The distribution of collaborations between research groups and firms,
according to their scientific field and sectoral industry, was determined by counting the
joint occurrence of all possible pairs of classifications (Figure 2). Therefore, the
simultaneous use of two dimensions of correspondence analysis to shape the cognitive
proximity measure configures itself as an additional contribution of this paper because
previous studies limit their measure to a given dimension.

Notably, there are not random patterns of collaborations between scientific fields and industries. For
example, the examination of collaborating firms in the Agriculture industry shows that producers interact
more with Agricultural Sciences, Veterinary and Chemical Engineering research groups. Similarly, Electric
and Gas and Electronic Equipment firms collaborate more often with Electrical, Mechanical, and Chemical
Engineering research groups. Moreover, Transportation and Urban Infrastructure firms interact more with
Civil Engineering research groups.

The dissimilar distribution of collaborations among sectoral industries and scientific fields provides a strong
indication of cognitive proximity. Firms seek to collaborate with research groups that are able to help them
to solve their innovative problems, and actors usually share complementary capabilities and absorptive
capacity, which indicates the existence of cognitive proximity. In this way, the observed frequency will be
compared with the relative contributions of the expected frequencies under independence to provide
information for an empirical measure of cognitive proximity.

Correspondence analysis can be used to assess this type of relationship between categorical variables.
Correspondence analysis allows the graphical representation the categories in rows (r) and columns (c)
from a decomposition of the associations of a contingency table (Beh, 2004). The classic method of simple
correspondence analysis is driven by the singular value decomposition of a measure of association based
on the chi-square statistic (Greenacre, 1984; Hoffman and Franke, 1986).

Considering this standpoint, in this paper, correspondence analysis was applied to the contingency table of
scientific fields and sectoral industries in order to create an index for cognitive proximity. From the
coordinates obtained through the correspondence analysis, vectors can be drawn for each scientific field
and sectoral industry pair; and cognitive proximity can then be interpreted in terms of the coordinates.
Therefore, cognitive proximity is defined by the cosine index, which is calculated by the inner product of
each scientific field and sectoral industry pair. Thus, the cognitive proximity index can be interpreted as
the association between a scientific field and an industry. Values closer to 1 represent vectors in the same
direction, which means a positive association between the scientific field and the sectoral industry. Such
categories are likely to occur together because the frequency is higher than expected under independence.

                                                                                                             8
Values closer to -1 represent vectors in opposite directions, representing a strong negative association.
Finally, values closer to zero, orthogonal vectors of around 90 degrees, correspond to what is expected to
be independence between the scientific field and the sectoral industry. The similarity measure reflects the
patterns of collaboration between research groups and firms, in which higher values indicate greater
cognitive proximity (Table 1).

From this representation, it is possible to note, for example, that the Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary
scientific fields exhibit similar patterns and magnitudes for cognitive proximity. Both are cognitively close
to industries such as the Public Administration, Agriculture, Food Processing, Non-durable goods, and
Retail Trade industries and cognitively distant from the Electric and Gas, Electronic Equipment, Mining,
Metal and transportation products and Transportation and Urban Infrastructure industries. Similarly, the
Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering scientific fields are cognitively closer to the Mining, Metal
and Transportation products, and Transportation and Urban Infrastructure industries and distant from the
Agriculture, Retail Trade and KIBS industries.

The measure for cognitive proximity should be independent of geographical distance.
Therefore, together determining the frequency of collaborations as a proxy for cognitive
proximity and geographic distance could cause problems of simultaneity and
endogeneity. In order to prevent this problem, correspondence analysis was applied only
to the co-located collaborations, by considering the first two quartiles, i.e., between zero
and the median (82.4 kilometres). Considering this collaboration to measure the cognitive
proximity, the proxy became independent from geographical distance because both
measures are not determined simultaneously.



3.4. Geographical distance and cognitive proximity
The frequency of collaboration of a scientific field and an industry was used to create the
cognitive proximity index. In order to relate cognitive proximity and geographical
distance, four groups sorted by the geographical proximity were formed from the quartiles
of the geographical distance. The cognitive proximity index average for each quartile

                                                                                                             9
shows that collaborations are more geographically distant when cognitive proximity
increases. This descriptive result indicates that cognitive proximity between two
collaborating actors allows them to interact at greater geographical distance. This means
that, in order to collaborate with more geographically distant research groups, firms
should be more cognitively close to their partner.
Box plots can also be used to visually represent the relation between geographical
distance and cognitive proximity. Each distribution of collaborations for the four groups
shows the differences in the distributions among groups, indicating that local
collaborations are associated with lower cognitive proximity (Figure 3).

4. Econometric analysis
An econometric model was estimated to analyse the relations between geographical
distance and cognitive proximity in the university-industry collaboration. Measures of
both geographical distance and cognitive proximity were used. The dependent variable is
geographical distance (DistGeo), and the most important independent variable is
cognitive proximity (ProxCog). By defining these two main variables, it was possible to
assess how the cognitive proximity affects the geographical distance of the collaborations
and to provide new empirical evidence on this issue.
Other independent variables were added to the model, especially those related to the main
characteristics of the collaborating firms and research groups. Previous research has
shown that the characteristics of both collaborating firms and research groups affect the

2011; Muscio, 2013; De Fuentes and Dutrénit, 2014; Garcia et al., 2015). In this way,
regarding the characteristics of the collaborating firms, two variables were added: the
absorptive capacity of the firm (AbsorCF), measured as the share of employees with a
higher education, and firm size (SizeF), and measured as the number of employees in
logarithmic form. The characteristics of the research groups include the quality of
academic research (Quali), measured as the number of published papers per researcher,
the size of the research group (SizeG), measured as the number of researchers in each
research group, and (TimeG) related to the research group’s lifetime. Control variables
for locational factors and for the type of collaboration were also added. Table 2 presents
the description of the main variables. Descriptive statistics are presented in the Table 3.
The empirical model was defined as follows.

The most important empirical result is the relation between the two analysed dimensions
of proximity, geographical distance and cognitive proximity. The results show that
cognitive proximity (ProxCog) is positively correlated to the geographical distance of the

                                                                                                             13
two partners. This indicates that higher cognitive proximity between the collaborating
firm and the research group tends to stimulate higher geographical distance collaboration.
This means that shared capabilities and expertise between the partners facilitate long-
distance interactions, and cognitive proximity can be a substitute for the geographical
proximity in fostering interactive learning between the two actors.

The ability of firms to collaborate with more geographically distant research groups is
associated with the cognitive proximity between the firm and its partner. In this way,
cognitive proximity can facilitate communication among actors, which can decrease the
importance and benefits of the co-location of the actors, and can substitute for
geographical proximity. In addition, cognitive proximity can reduce the costs of
interactions over long geographical distances because actors can also solve
communication problems using online communication. Temporary geographical
proximity may also be an important factor related to cognitive proximity between
research groups and collaborating firms, since temporary meetings between actors are
easier and more productive when common communication channels exist. In this way,
high cognitive proximity renders firms less dependent on co-location with their
collaborating academic partner, since the actors share the same knowledge base.

This result converges on the theoretical literature on the dimensions of proximity. The
main effect of the cognitive proximity between two actors is to facilitate communication
and knowledge sharing, which stimulate interactions and foster interactive learning
(Nooteboom, 2000; Boschma, 2005; Krafft et al., 2014; Broekel, 2015). Similarly,
previous studies show that cognitive proximity can substitute for geographical proximity
because it can facilitate communication between two agents and then foster collaboration.
This can be seen in the analysis of the collaborative innovation projects in the Danish
clean tech industry (Hansen, 2015) and in the benefits of network effects for scientific
collaboration (Bergé, 2016). Similar results on geographical and institutional proximities
were also obtained by an investigation of the Canadian infection and immunity research
networks (Lander, 2015). Otherwise, an investigation on local networks of firms shows
that, when actors are located in the same region, cognitive proximity can strengthen firms’
local networks (Broekel and Boschma, 2011).

By contrast, low cognitive proximity between firms and research groups increases the
importance of local collaborations, as indicated by the lower average distance of their
collaborations. This indicates that low cognitive distance among partners can demand that
they meet constantly, which hinders the establishment of a geographically distant
collaboration. In this way, the findings of this paper, applied to university-industry
collaboration, are convergent with previous empirical studies because the results show
that cognitive proximity can act as a substitute for geographical proximity.

Taking a specific look at the collaborations between firms and universities, there is an
interesting debate regarding the main drivers of the geographical distance of the
university-industry collaboration (D’Este and Iammarino, 2010; Laursen et al., 2011;
Muscio, 2013; De Fuentes and Dutrénit, 2014; Garcia et al., 2015). The main results of
previous studies show that the characteristics of both firms and universities are important
drivers of the geographical distance of university-industry collaborations. On this subject,
the findings of this paper show that cognitive proximity is another factor that affects the
geographical distance of collaboration between firms and universities. Collaborating
firms and research groups with high cognitive proximity are able to share similar


                                                                                          14
capabilities and expertise, which allow them to collaborate across larger geographical
distances.

In order to strengthen the results, another proxy for cognitive proximity was used as a
robustness check. This alternative measure for cognitive proximity consisted of the
composition of the labour force, using data on employment classification in each sectoral
industry (models 4 and 5). This alternative proxy is a completely exogenous measure of
cognitive proximity, which allows its use as a robustness check. The main results remain
the same.

Regarding the characteristics of collaborating firms, both the absorptive capacity
(AbsorvCF) and size of the firm (SizeF) positively affect the geographical distance of
collaborations, in line with previous studies (D’Este and Iammarino, 2010; Muscio, 2013;
Garcia et al., 2015). Firms with higher absorptive capacity are able to collaborate not only
with more academic research groups but also with academic research groups at greater
geographical distances (Garcia et al., 2015). These firms tend to face more complex
innovation problems, and they are able to search for a broader set of research groups that
can help them solve these problems. Sometimes, they find local research groups, but
often, the academic capabilities that they need can be found only in geographically distant
universities. In this way, firms with higher absorptive capacity are less dependent on the
co-location of research groups in finding academic partners. Regarding the firm size,
larger firms have broader capabilities for searching geographically distant universities
and coordinating distant collaborations.

In regard to the characteristics of the research groups, both the quality of the research
(Quali) and the size of the research group (SizeG) have positive and significant
coefficients, which also confirms results of previous studies (Laursen et al., 2011; Garcia
et al., 2015). Research groups that produce high quality research can increase the
geographical distance of the collaborations, which indicates that firms are willing to
collaborate with more distant high quality research groups to support their innovation
efforts. In fact, firms may search for high-quality universities as collaborating partners
because they think that such research groups have greater and more advanced capabilities
for handling complex innovation problems. By contrast, low performance research groups
engage in more local collaborations, since their capabilities are more likely to address
only the innovation problems of local firms. Furthermore, the size of research groups
positively affects the geographical distance of collaborations, indicating that research
groups with more researchers are able to engage in collaborations are greater geographical
distances. In addition, larger research groups have a broader structure, which provides
them with greater and more diversified academic capabilities to solve more complex
innovation problems.

In order to measure the possible relations between cognitive proximity and the main
capabilities of the collaborating firms, two interactive variables were also added to the
model (model 3). The first was the interaction between cognitive proximity and
absorptive capacity (ProxCog*AbsorCF). Previous empirical studies show the
importance of cognitive proximity and the main capabilities of firms, as measured by
absorptive capacity (Krafft et al., 2014; Broekel, 2015). The second interactive variable
is that between cognitive proximity and the quality of research group (ProxCog*Quali)
in order to assess the relations between cognitive proximity and the quality of the research
performed by research groups (Laursen et al., 2011; Garcia et al., 2015).


                                                                                          15
The results show that the interaction term between cognitive proximity and absorptive
capacity (ProxCog*AbsorCF) positively affects the geographical distance of university-
industry collaborations. This result shows the existence of combined effects of the
cognitive proximity and the absorptive capacity that increases geographic distance of
collaborations. This result reinforces the positive effects of cognitive proximity in the
geographical distance of collaborations because this effect is preserved when high
cognitive proximity is combined with the high absorptive capacity of the collaboration
firm. Therefore, an increase in the cognitive proximity or in the absorptive capacity
symmetrically fosters firms’ abilities to collaborate with geographically distant
universities. Furthermore, the other interaction term between cognitive proximity and of
the quality of the research performed by the research group (ProxCog*Quali) presents no
significance. In this way, the quality of research group is important by itself, and its
importance is not related to the importance of the cognitive proximity.



6. Final remarks and policy implications
An important assumption in the literature on the geography of innovation is that
geographical proximity plays an important role in fostering interactive learning among
actors because it can stimulate frequent interactions and face-to-face contact (Glaeser et
al., 1992; Gertler, 2003; Storper and Venables, 2004). However, recent studies have
shown that geographical proximity is not a sufficient condition because the interactive
learning requires complementarities among actors’ capabilities and the existence of
specific channels of communication among them. Other forms of non-spatial proximity
can be important tools to stimulate interactions between two partners (Gilly and Torre,
2000; Boschma, 2005; Broekel, 2015). One of these non-spatial forms of proximity is
cognitive proximity, which can substitute geographical proximity because the existence
of similar capabilities and common channels of communication can stimulate interaction
at long distances (Broekel and Boschma, 2011; Paci et al., 2014; Balland et al., 2015).
In this paper, these assumptions were applied to university-industry collaboration in order
to analyse the relation between geographical and cognitive proximity. In order to relate
these two types of proximity, a measure of cognitive proximity was created by using
correspondence analysis to relate the knowledge area of the research groups and the
industrial sector of the collaborating firms. Therefore, the cognitive proximity index is a
new contribution of the paper because previous studies have measured cognitive or
technological proximity using only one dimension.
Regarding the relation between the two types of proximity, the main results show that
geographical proximity can largely substitute for geographical proximity because, when
two actors are cognitively close, they tend to interact at larger geographical distances. In
this way, the existence of similar capabilities and shared expertise between the
collaborating firm and the academic partner can stimulate them to collaborate even at
high geographical distances. This result represents new empirical evidence on the relation
between geographical and other non-spatial forms of proximity, especially between
geographical and cognitive proximity. The main results converge with previous
theoretical and empirical results that cognitive proximity can substitute for geographical
proximity in fostering collaboration between two actors.
Taking a specific look at university-industry linkages, the findings of this paper show that
cognitive proximity between the collaborating firm and the academic partner affect the

                                                                                          16
geographical distance of collaborations. Previous studies have shown that firms often
prefer to collaborate with close university partners. However, they also show that the
characteristics of the firms, such as absorptive capacity, and universities, such as the
quality of academic research, are factors that can stimulate firms to interact with
geographically distant universities. The findings of this paper add that cognitive
proximity can be another factor that stimulates firms to collaborate with distant
universities.
Finally, these findings offer policy implications. First, the results highlight the importance
of universities for innovation. In this way, policy makers should design policies that
stimulate and strengthen university-industry linkages. Second, the results show the
importance of geographical proximity to foster interactive learning between the
collaborating firm and the academic partner. Policies should thus provide mechanisms
that allow the collaborating firm to take benefits from the externalities that arise from the
geographic concentration of agents. Third, the findings show that cognitive proximity and
high absorptive capacity can stimulate firms to collaborate with geographically distant
universities. In this way, policies that stimulate university-industry linkages should
include mechanisms to strengthen the absorptive capacity of firms by stimulating them to
increase their highly qualified industrial researchers. Thereby, collaborating firms will be
able to become cognitively closer to their academic partners, which will facilitate
collaboration.
