       In this paper, we explore the dynamic relationship between economic growth and several
       measures of governance quality across a wide sample of countries. Using a panel VAR
       approach, which allow us to also account for time invariant characteristics intrinsic to
       each country, we show that, on average, shocks to governance quality exert a positive and
       significant impact to economic growth, one that is sustained for more than ten years after
       the initial shock. Accordingly, we also find that as much as 33% of the variation in GDP
       can be explained by variations in governance. Therefore, our results bring support to the
       institutional view of economic growth, with better governance fostering higher growth.

1        Introduction
Since the seminal work of North (1990), the debate about the determinants of long-run growth
has acknowledged the important role played by political and economic institutions in the process
of economic development. In fact, there is a belief that differences in institutions constitute one
of the fundamental explanations for differences in economic growth across countries - a view
that gained popular appeal from contributions such as Acemoglu, Johnson & Robinson (2001),
among others. The institutional view shifts away from the traditional focus on elements such
as innovation and capital factor accumulation, and centers on the incentive structures inherent
to the way societies are organized. A complementary and, in some sense, opposing view is
that geography also matters for economic development and it may also matter for the kind of
institution implemented in a specific society (Bloom & Sachs, 1998; Gallup & Sachs, 2001; Sachs,
2003). However, authors like Rodrik et al. (2004) argue that once institutions are controlled
for, measures of geography have little effect on economic growth.1
    One of the ways societies are organized can be represented by its governance structure, which
it can be defined, in a broad sense, as the traditions and practices carried out by political
institutions in the exercise of their authority. Studying the different aspects of governance
helps us to characterize how good or efficient the public administration of a country is and
how influential it can be to the lives of ordinary citizens. The quality of public services, the
implementation of sound public policies, the enforcement of property rights and the absence
of corruption are some examples of measures of good governance. The extent to which these
elements relate to economic growth and whether any causal relationship can be established
has been a matter of discussion in recent literature (e.g. Kaufmann & Kraay, 2002; Kurtz &
Schrank, 2007).
    This paper aims to contribute to this debate by exploring the dynamic relationship among
several measures of governance and economic growth across a wide sample of countries. In
particular, we investigate how shocks to governance affect growth performance and vice-versa.
Our measures of governance quality are taken from the database first presented in Kaufmann
et al. (2000), which provides indicators on six dimensions of governance for 215 countries over a
period of 18 years. As in Góes (2016), we implement a Panel Structural Vector Autoregression
(Panel VAR) model to estimate the dynamic relationships and the effects of interest. Within
that framework, we also promote an assessment on the effect of this relationship on the distri-
bution of growth in these countries, by observing how a measure of inequality jointly evolves
with the other variables during the period of analysis.
    By relying on the panel VAR methodology we are able to investigate the dynamic structure
of the existing relationship between governance and growth across countries and over time. One
of the advantages over a traditional VAR is the possibility to include fixed effects coefficients
to also account for time invariant characteristics intrinsic to each country in our sample. In
addition, this methodology exploits the panel structure of the data (short T and large N)
that would not be reliable in a traditional VAR estimation. As in the VAR methodology, we
implement an identification scheme to recover structural impulse-response functions (IRFs) and
assess the dynamic effects of exogenous shocks to each variable in the system.
    Our results show that, on average, shocks to governance quality positively impact economic
growth and that this effect remains significant for more than ten periods thereafter. We also
find that as much as 33% of the variation in GDP growth can be explained by variations in
1
    Although we acknowledge the importance of this debate, in this paper, we take a different perspective by
    assuming that differences in geography are time invariant and thus are captured in our country-specific fixed
    effects estimates.

governance. However, when we account for inequality,the model is less able to map any signif-
icant influence from governance in the direction of either growth or inequality, although both
variables continue to exert significant effects on governance in positive and negative directions,
respectively.
    Our findings are related, more directly, to the branch of the literature that investigates the
relationship between economic growth and the various aspects that define good governance,
an effort that extends both to theoretical (e.g. Gradstein, 2004) as to empirical grounds (e.g.
Mauro, 1995; Kaufmann & Kraay, 2002). By considering how this relates to income distribution,
we also join recent contributions investigating the effects of growth on inequality (e.g. Brueckner
et al., 2015). From a methodological point of view, our work follows the innovative step of
taking the VAR approach into the literature delving in the relationship between economics and
institutions (e.g. Góes, 2016).
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give the details on
the datasets used. In section 3 we present our empirical methodology. Section 4 discusses the
results. Finally, conclusions are presented in section 5.


2    Data
Our main measures of governance are from the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)
project, which provides cross-country composite indicators on six broad dimensions of gov-
ernance over the period of 1996 to 2014.2 In our analysis, we treat each indicator as a separate
variable and label them accordingly, as shown in Table 1. The table also presents a description
of each variable as provided by the source.

                                      [Table 1 about here.]

    The WGI data is largely perception-based in the sense that it is a combination of dif-
ferent views on the quality of governance from survey respondents and public, private and
non-government organization sector experts, compiled from more than than 30 individual data
sources. Final estimates for each country are reported in units of a standard normal distribution
(with mean zero and standard deviation of one) and run between approximately -2.5 to 2.5,
with higher values corresponding to better governance. Standard errors for each value are also
reported, reflecting the extent to which the underlying data sources agree with one another.
    We choose “Government Effectiveness” (Gov GE ) as the indicator for which we will derive our
baseline analyses, since its description includes what we consider as more observable measures of
governance quality, such as: political independence, effectiveness in policy implementation and
general quality of public services. Figure 1 shows OLS plots from pooled correlation between
Gov GE and the other variables, revealing a high degree of correlation between them.3

                                      [Figure 1 about here.]

    To measure differences in growth trends both within and between countries, we use figures
for GDP per capita in constant 2005 U.S. dollars from the World Development Indicators.4
For our measure of inequality, we use the Gini indexes compiled in the All the Ginis Dataset,

the most comprehensive dataset on inequality available.5 The final merged data with inter-
sected information on growth and the six measures of governance comprises 2970 unbalanced
observations for 208 countries and 16 years (between 1996 and 2002, the WGI reported its
estimates once every two years and from 2003 on, reports are yearly). When we condition it to
the available information on inequality, our sample drops to 906 observations.


3     Methodology
We construct a panel VAR model with Yit = [Growthit , Govit ]0 as our vector of k endoge-
nous variables for country i at time t. Each indicator presented in Table 1 will be anal-
ysed separately, so we refer to them in this section with a general term, Govit . In our
main specification, Growthit ≡ log(GDP )it and thus k = 2. In our secondary specification,
Growthit ≡ [log(GDP )it , Giniit ]0 and k = 3, since we consider inequality as being a component
of growth. The reduced form dynamic relationship among our endogenous variables can be
described by:

                    Yit = A0i + A(`)Yt−1 + uit            i = 1, ..., 208 t = 1996, ..., 2014                      (1)
where A0i is a k × 1 vector of time-invariant   country-specific intercepts, A(`) are k × k matrices
of lagged coefficients, A(`) ≡ pj=1 Aj `j−1 , that collects the own- and cross-effects of the `th
                                 P
lag of the dependent variable on their current observations. Finally, uit , is a k × 1 vector of
idiosyncratic disturbances where E(uit ) = 0, E(uit u0it ) = Σu (being Σu a nonsingular matrix)
and E(uis u0it ) = 0 for t 6= s.
    The country-specific intercepts, A0i , in equation (1) are correlated with the error term, and
thus estimation through OLS will lead to biased coefficients. A common strategy to deal with
this, particularly in settings where N is large and T is fixed, is to implement a transformation
in the model to eliminate the individual fixed-effects and then make use of GMM estimation
methods using lagged observations as instruments. We follow the approach in Arellano & Bover
(1995) and rewrite (1) in terms of forward orthogonal deviations. That is, for every element
yit ∈ Yit ,
                                                        r
                                      ∗                     Tit
                                     yit = (yit − yit )                                          (2)
                                                          Tit + 1
where Tit is the number of available future observations for country i at time t and yit is its
average. This kind of transformation has some advantages over simple first-differences. By using
deviations from an average instead of from another observation, forward orthogonal deviations
reduces data loss and is less hampered by varying gaps between observations, which is the case
in unbalanced panels. Following Holtz-Eakin, Newey & Rosen (1988), the instruments list is
composed by observed realizations only, with missing observations substituted by zero.6

  for Development Research (WIDER), World Bank Povcal, and Ginis from individual long-term inequality
  studies.

  These steps were originally structured in Abrigo & Love (Abrigo & Love), who also provides the computational
  routine we use in this paper. As detailed in Roodman (2009), from the hypothesis that instruments are orthog-
  onal to the error term, the GMM estimator for Aj in (1) takes the form Âj = (X ∗0 ZW Z 0 X ∗ )−1 (X ∗0 ZW Z 0 Y ∗ ),
  where Y ∗ is a vector with transformed variables in the left-hand side for the model, X ∗ is a matrix with lagged

     To identify the structural shocks, we impose a restriction on the variance-covariance struc-
ture of the residuals so that Σu takes the form of an lower-triangular matrix. This Cholesky
ordering is based on two premises. First, we posit that a country’s economic performance pre-
cedes the distribution of its resources, and therefore we set Giniit to have no contemporaneous
influence on log(GDP )it . Second, because our measures of governance are perception-based
measures, as discussed in section 2, we believe them to be the most endogenously-defined ele-
ments of our model, and so both variables in Growthit are able to contemporaneously impact
Govit whereas the reverse is not allowed. Therefore, the entry ordering in our baseline model
is given by Yit = [log(GDP )it , Govit ]0 while in the model that includes inequality the ordering
is Yit = [log(GDP )it , Giniit , Govit ]0 .
     For the purpose of recovering impulse response functions, we rewrite equation (1) as B(`)Yit =
uit , where B(`) = (Ik − A(`)). As described in Lütkepohl (2005), if every eingenvalue in A(`)
is less than 1 in modulus, than B(`)      Pwill satisfy   the stability condition and be invertible. The
calculated values B(`)−1 = Φ(`) = ∞          j=0 jΦ `j
                                                       will  then be the parameters of the MA represen-
tation of our model, Yit = Φ(`)uit , where
                                        (
                                            Ik ,               j=0
                                 Φj = Pi                                                              (3)
                                                j=1 Φt−j Aj , j = 1, 2, ...

Since the disturbances uit are contemporaneously correlated, stochastic shocks to one variable
are likely to be accompanied by shocks in other variables, which prevents us from drawing causal
interpretations. However, the imposed Cholesky ordering allows the decomposition Σu = P 0 P ,
where P is also an lower-triangular matrix. It is then possible to orthogonalize disturbances
as P −1 uit (which will have covariance matrix P −1 Σu (P −1 )0 = Ik ) and transform the MA pa-
rameters into orthogonalized impulse-responses, Φi P . That way shocks to one variable will
independently provoke dynamic responses in the other variables of the system.


4     Results
Our results are presented in two parts. First we show our main results for what we define as
our baseline model, conducting more thorough evaluations in this part. Then we broaden our
discussion with alternative specifications in a subsequent section for robustness.

4.1     Baseline
Our baseline specification consists of two panel VAR’s models built so to evaluate the interaction
between economic growth and governance quality for a wide sample of countries. In our first
model, the vector of endogenous variables is composed by Yit = [Log(GDP )it , GovitGE ]0 , where
Log(GDP )it and GovitGE are our respective measures of economic growth and governance quality
as described in sections 2 an 3. In choosing our model optimal lag length, we rely on a set
of consistent moment and model selection criteria proposed by Andrews & Lu (2001) and
recommended for Panel VAR models by Abrigo & Love (Abrigo & Love). According to those
criteria, our models should be estimated using only one lag.7
  transformed variables in its right-hand side and W is a weighting matrix assumed to be non-singular, symmetric
  and positive semi-definite, chosen so as to maximize efficiency.
7
  Values by criterion are reported in table 4, in appendix B. Andrews & Lu’s (2001) criteria are based on
  Hansen’s J statistic of over identifying restrictions and are analogous to various commonly used maximum
  likelihood-based model selection criteria such as the AIC, the BIC and the HQIC. As an alternative, we also


                                                       5
    We also check the stability condition and observe that the eingenvalues of the matrix of
estimated coefficients are strictly less than one.8 After the estimation, we therefore proceed in
calculating impulse-responses, whose plots are displayed in Figure 2. The results comply with
the institutional view by showing that shocks to Gov GE , our measure of governance, incur in
a positive and statistically significant impact on Log(GDP ), remaining so after ten years from
the shock. We also show that shocks in Log(GDP ) carry a positive effect to Gov GE , which
remains statistically significant up to ten periods after the initial shock.

                                          [Figure 2 about here.]

    In order to evaluate the relative cumulative contribution of each of the variables to the
overall behaviour of our model, we complement our analysis by also performing forecast-error
variance decompositions. Results are presented in table 3, with estimates separated in two-
periods intervals and spanning a total forecast horizon of ten periods. Based on such estimates,
we find that 8% of variation on Gov GE can be explained by Log(GDP ). Most noticeably, we
also find that as much as 33% of the variation in Log(GDP ) can be explained by variations
in Gov GE . Therefore, better governance plays an important role in explaining the course of a
country’s economic growth.

                                           [Table 2 about here.]

    Our next step will be to analyse how the variables of the first specification influence each
country’s figures for income inequality throughout the period of analysis. The resulting vector
of endogenous variables will now be Yit = [Log(GDP )it , Giniit , GovitGE ], where Giniit is defined
as our measure of inequality. As previously discussed, this secondary specification aims to
improve our comprehension on how better governance also relates to income distribution across
countries and over time. We must, however, take the care of assigning a lesser dimension to the
following results, considering the greater unbalanceness and reduction of our sample size that
comes as a consequence in this specification, as we pointed out in section 2.
    Impulse-response plots in Figure 3 show that shocks to Log(GDP ) impact Gini in a negative
direction, meaning that, on average, inequality is reduced following a shock on Log(GDP ). As
before, Log(GDP ) impacts Gov in a positive direction and both relationships remain significant
up to ten periods after the shock. Shocks to Gini, that is, higher inequality, impact both
Log(GDP ) and Gov GE in a negative direction, translating into less growth and less governance
quality. Finally, in this specification, the responses of Log(GDP ) and Gini to an improvement
Gov GE are not statistically different from zero. Variance decomposition in Table 3 further
shows that 17% of the variation in Log(GDP ) can be explained by variations in Gini, and that
Gov GE only marginally explains variations in other variables.

4.2     Robustness
Our first robustness exercise is to replace the variable Govit in Yit by one of the five other
measures of governance not considered in the baseline model and evaluate how results deviate
from their original specifications. In each case, results remain qualitatively unchanged, with
shocks to both variables for growth and governance exerting positive and significant impacts
in one another. Although the effect from a shock in Log(GDP ) more rapidly fades away when
GovitRQ and GovitCC are the response variables, as we see in Figure 4.9

                                         [Figure 4 about here.]

    We proceed in the same way as before and expand our set of endogenous variables to account
for income distribution in each of the alternative specifications. Figure 5 shows the resulting
impulse-response plots between each of the variables included in each different system, where we
vary between the definitions of Gov.10 Overall, an improvement in governance, as represented
by the alternative measures we use in this paper, has a positive impact on Log(GDP ), as in our
baseline specification, except for regulatory quality. It is possible that better regulatory quality
perception may be a result of tighter regulation, which may harm growth in the first years after
the shock. However, over time the negative effect disappears completely. It is also interesting
to notice that a shock to Log(GDP ) yields similar results to other governance measures, i.e., a
positive shock to Log(GDP ) improves governance.

                                         [Figure 5 about here.]

    Our next exercise is to test for alternative Cholesky orderings for the two baseline speci-
fications. For our first model, this consists on simply inverting the ordering between the two
variables in the system, Log(GDP ) and Gov GE . For the second model, we test for the five al-
ternative orderings between variables Log(GDP ), Gov GE and Gini. Results obtained for each
specification and alternative ordering are virtually equivalent to the previous ones, bearing in
mind the respective constraints that each different sorting imposes on the correlations between
variables in the first periods. The previous interpretations are therefore also valid, and the
impulse-response graphs are not reproduced for the purpose of saving space.


5     Conclusion
In this paper, we use a comprehensive cross-country dataset with perception-based measures of
governance quality to study the relationship between governance and economic growth. We rely
on a panel VAR approach to study this relationship, which allows us to account for country-
specific fixed effects, and focus on impulse-response analysis to evaluate the effects of shocks
to governance on economic growth.Variance decomposition is also performed in order to assess
the importance of those effects.
    We find that, on average, shocks to governance quality positively impact economic growth
and this effect remains significant for more than ten years thereafter (the inverse relationship
9
 We reproduce plots for the system where Gov GE is our governance variable to facilitate comparisons and, in
 order to save space, we do not show impulse-response plots within a same variable. Prior to calculating each
 plot, we check for the same modelling conditions regarding number of lags and system stability and see that
 both provide the same answers as before.
10
   As in table 4, we do not show plots of resulting effects within a same variable in order to save space and
   neither the effects between Log(GDP ) and Gini, since they do not bring new insights with respect to the
   baseline results.

and over time can be explained by variations in governance quality. Therefore, our results
bring additional support to the institutional view of economic growth, with better governance
fostering higher growth.

 Notes: The column on the left contains the plots of the
responses from log(GDP ) to a shock of one standard de-
viation in the Gov Index referenced in each row. The col-
umn on the right are the responses from each Gov Index to
a shock of one standard deviation in log(GDP ). For com-
parative purpsoes, we replicate the correspondent results
from Figure 2 in the last row. The solid lines correspond
to the median responses to the shocks in a ten period
horizon and the dashed lines are 68% confidence interval.

 Notes: The first column, from left to right, contains the plots of the responses from Gini to a shock of
one standard deviation in the Gov Index referenced in each row. The second column are the responses from
each Gov Index to a shock of one standard deviation in Gini. The two columns on the right repeat this same

results from Figure 3 in the last row. The solid lines correspond to the median responses to the shocks in a
ten period horizon and the dashed lines are 68% confidence interval.
