 We provide a new index of educational services’ quality of Brazilian states in 2010. This
 measure is constructed based on the notion that the financial returns obtained from an ad-
 ditional year of schooling can be seen as derived from the value that market forces assign
 to this education. We use migrants data to estimate returns to schooling of individuals
 that studied in different states but who work in the same labor market. We find very
 heterogeneous educational qualities across states: the poorest Brazilian region presents
 education quality index equal to approximately one third of the other regions. We com-
 pare our index with basic education test scores and conclude that there are important
 similarities and differences between them.

 Nesse artigo, construímos um novo índice de qualidade da educação dos estados brasilei-
 ros em 2010. A construção dessa medida é baseada na ideia de que o retorno financeiro
 obtido com um ano adicional de estudo pode ser considerado como originado do va-
 lor que as forças de mercado atribuem a essa educação. Usamos dados de migrantes
 para estimar retornos à escolaridade de indivíduos que estudaram em estados diferentes,
 mas que trabalham no mesmo mercado de trabalho. Obtemos um índice de qualidade
 educacional muito heterogêneo: a região brasileira mais pobre possui qualidade da edu-
 cação igual a aproximadamente um terço das demais regiões. Comparamos esse índice
 com notas de exames do sistema de educação básico e concluímos que há importantes
 similaridades e diferenças entre as duas medidas.

1     Introduction
Education is very important for socioeconomic development.1 A country’s level of education
has two dimensions: quantity and quality. The first one has been studied extensively.2 The
same is not true for quality. This dimension is very complex because it may involve subjective
considerations, becoming very hard to be measured. Besides this, some authors argue that
quality of education matters even more than quantity for economic growth.3
    In this paper we provide a new index of educational services’ quality of Brazilian states
in 2010. This measure is constructed based on the notion that the financial returns obtained
from an additional year of schooling can be seen as derived from the value that the market
assigns to this education. Therefore, differences between returns to schooling of individuals
who studied in different states, all else equal, is due to differences between the quality of
educational services consumed by them.
    At first, one can think of constructing such measures by using each state data separately.
However, a possible drawback of this approach is that labor market characteristics vary sig-
nificantly over Brazilian states. Thus, comparing educational returns in different states as
education quality measures can lead to biased analysis. For example, suppose that labor mar-
kets are more developed in higher income states so that individuals with high-tech knowledge
earn significantly more than less educated workers. On the other hand, suppose that technol-
ogy companies are incipient in lower income states and that high-tech professionals earn not
much more than less educated workers. In this case, estimating returns to schooling sepa-
rately by state and interpreting it as education quality measures would lead one to conclude
that educational services are better in richer states. However, in a counterfactual scenario it
is possible that both workers have the same educational returns had they worked in the same
firm.
    To prevent this type of bias, we use data on individuals who obtained education in differ-
ent states but who work in markets with similar characteristics. This is done by using 2010
census data on individuals who lived in São Paulo (SP), the Brazilian state with the largest
population. The 2010 census contains information on migration that can be used to infer
which migrants likely completed schooling in their state of birth. This strategy is similar to
the one used in Schoellman (2012). Since migrants are probably positively self-selected,4 we
use Heckman’s (1979) selection correction method.
    Brazil is divided into five regions,5 which are very unequal in terms of economic out-
comes. The Northeast and North are the country’s poorest regions, having per capita GDP

    1 See Sen (2000), and Banerjee and Duflo (2012).
    2 For reviews of this literature, see Sianesi and van Reenen (2003), and Krueger and Lindahl (2000).
    3 Hanushek and Wobmann (2007) argue that analysis limited to schooling quantity misses the core of what

eduacation is all about. They point that extensive evidence on knowledge development and cognitive skills in-
dicates that a variety of factors outside of school (family, peers, and others) have a direct and powerful influence
on economic growth.

in 2013 equal to R$ 12,954 and R$ 17,213 respectively, followed by the South (R$ 30,495),
Midwest (R$ 32,322), and Southeast (R$ 34,789) regions. Compatible with this ranking,
our method produces very heterogeneous educational quality indexes across states. Regional
means are: Northeast 3.4%, Midwest 6.9%, South 8.9%, and Southeast 9.7%.6
     We compare our index with 1995-2005 basic education test scores and conclude that
there are important differences and similarities between them. On the one hand, our method
pictures a more unequal scenario than test scores do: Northeastern states’ mean score is equal
to 92.3% of the others regions’ mean for the case of basic education test scores, and 30.2%
for the case of our index. This is evidence that there are aspects related to education quality
that our method captures, but test scores do not. On the other hand, despite the differences
there is a high correlation between both indexes.
     We believe that this paper provides at least two important contributions. First, we con-
tribute to the scarce literature on economics and educational quality in Brazil7 by providing
an alternative quality measure based on the value assigned to education by market forces.
This can inform researchers and subsidize policy makers. Second, the high correlation be-
tween our index and test scores is evidence that supports the use of returns to education as
an educational quality index. For some countries, educational quality measures are scarce,
whereas data on earnings and schooling are easily available. Therefore, verifying the cor-
relation between returns to schooling and test scores can support researchers interested in
constructing education quality measures for developing countries.
     Our method is very similar to Schoellman’s (2012), who constructs measures of educa-
tional quality for several countries by estimating returns to schooling for immigrants in the
United States. Kaarsen (2014) provides another measure of human capital quality by investi-
gating the Trends in Math and Science Study test scores, exploiting the fact that those exams
were applied in different countries for two distinct grades.
     Some authors corroborate that returns to schooling of immigrants are positively corre-
lated with mean educational quality in the source country. Chiswick and Miller (2010) and
Bratsberg and Terrell (2002) verify that international test scores explain differences in the
rate of return to schooling among immigrants in the United States. Li and Sweetman (2013)
find the same for the case of Canada.
     Methodologically, this paper is related to the literature that exploits migration for iden-
tification purposes. For example, Card and Krueger (1992) studies returns to schooling of
cross-state migrants with the objective of estimating the education production function in
the United States. Alesina and Giuliano (2010) study how strength of family ties affect the
behavior of second-generation immigrants in the United States. Okoye (2012) presents ev-
idence that investment in higher education produces positive externalities by verifying that
returns to schooling of immigrants in the U.S. in 2000 are positively correlated to the pro-
portion of higher educated workers in 1980 in the country of origin, even after controlling
    6 We do not consider the North region because in our dataset there is a small number of observations of
migrants in São Paulo who were born in northern states.

for other determinants of education quality. Moriconi and Peri (2015) use variations among
behavior of first and second-generation cross-country European migrants to isolate the effect
of culturally transmitted labor-leisure preferences on individual employment rates.
    There is a large literature on returns to schooling in Brazil. For example, Jacinto and
Rodeghiero (2012) use the 2007 Household Sample National Survey (Pesquisa Nacional por
Amostragem de Domicílios – PNAD) and three different methods (Griliches’ (1977), Heck-
man’s (1976), and Garen’s (1984)) to estimate returns to schooling. They find heterogeneous
returns across schooling levels, and that higher education produces the highest return. Bar-
bosa Filho and Pessôa (2008) use 1980-2004 PNADs and the 2000 census to estimate the
Internal Rate of Return of education, obtaining a value equal to 18%. Resende and Wylie
(2006) use the 1996-1997 Research on Living Standards (Pesquisa sobre Padrões de Vida
– PPV) and Heckman’s (1976) method to conclude that returns to schooling equal 12.6%
for women and 15.9% for men. Sachsida et al. (2004) estimate returns using simple OLS,
Heckman’s (1976), and Garen’s (1984) methods. They use PNAD data in three different
ways: cross section for 1996, and pooled data and pseudopainel for 1992-1999. Estimated
returns are between 10% and 22%. Our paper is naturally distinct from those since we are
not interested in returns to schooling per se, but on educational quality measures.
    This paper is organized in four more sections. Section 2 describes the datasets used, the
sample selection strategy, and descriptive statistics. Section 3 explains the method used to
construct educational quality measures, and analyzes the results. Section 4 compares our
educational quality index with basic education test scores. Section 5 presents concluding
comments.


2    Data
In order to estimate educational returns, we use data from the 2010 Brazilian census. This
dataset is provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), and con-
tains information related to individuals’ residence characteristics, work, migration, school-
ing, mobility, and fecundity. We use data on individuals’ earnings in the main job, hours
worked per week, schooling attainment, age, state of birth, state of residence, race, gender,
and urban/rural residence.
    As Schoellman’s (2012) data, the 2010 census does not provide direct information on
where schooling was obtained. We follow the same strategy as him and use information on
age, year of migration, and schooling attainment to infer which migrants likely completed
schooling in their state of birth. Therefore, our sample includes individuals with age greater
than or equal to 24, which is the expected date of graduation plus six years. This buffer is
used in order to minimize measurement error from migrants who repeat grades, start school
late, or experience interruptions in their education. We exclude migrants who are studying in
São Paulo and, for individuals who were born and work in São Paulo, we exclude those who
are studying in another state or those who previously lived in another state. We also exclude

    The 2010 census also lacks information on the exact numbers of years of schooling at-
tainment. Instead, it is possible to construct a categorical educational variable that identifies
the following years of schooling intervals: from 0 to 3 years, 4-7, 8-10, 11-14, and 15 years
or more. We deal with this limitation in two alternative ways. First, we impute individuals’
years of schooling in the first four intervals as the interval mean, and 15 years for individ-
uals in the last interval. Second, in Subsection 3.1 we estimate returns to schooling using
dummy variables for each educational category and calculate the weighted mean return using
the fraction of individuals in each interval as weights. Both methods produce qualitatively
similar results.
    Table 1 contains descriptive statistics and number of observations by state of birth. Note
that our sample includes individuals who do not live in São Paulo because those observations
are used in Heckman’s selection correction method. For most states of birth, mean years of
schooling are higher for individuals who live in São Paulo. This is evidence that migrants are
positively selected. We exclude the North region and Distrito Federal in our main analysis
because they present small number of observations of migrants. Including those observations
produces estimates with large standard errors, making inference questionable.
    To compare estimated returns to schooling with another educational quality measure,
we use Sistema Nacional de Avaliação da Educação Básica (Saeb) test scores for the years
1995-2005. The Saeb exam is administered by the Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas
Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (Inep), an institution associated to the Ministry of Education
and, since 1995, is composed by biennial Mathematics and Portuguese tests applied to sam-
ples of students in the 4th and 8th grade of the Elementary School (Ensino Fundamental),
and the 3rd year of the High School (Ensino Médio), in public and private schools.8
    Table 2 contains mean Saeb test scores by year, state and region. During 1995-2005,
Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, and Distrito Federal students had the highest scores, and
Roraima, Tocantins, and Maranhão students had the lowest scores. For all years, the South-
east region ranked first, followed by the South region, and the North and Northeast regions
shared the last position. At national level, there is a high downward trend in mean scores.


3     Returns to schooling as educational quality measures
Our objective is to construct new measures of the quality of educational services by state in
Brazil through the estimation of returns to schooling. Our strategy builds on the idea that
financial returns obtained from an additional year of schooling can be seen as derived from
the value that the market assigns to this education. Therefore, differences between returns to
schooling of individuals who studied in different states, all else equal, is due to differences
    8 Inep’sÍndice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica (Ideb) is a broader educational quality index than
Saeb because it embodies both Saeb test scores and approval rates. However, we do not use it because it is
available only from 2005, a relatively recent year. Our dataset contains information on individuals who were
working in 2010, and most of them studied many years before 2005.

between the quality of educational services that they consumed.
   A first approach to implement this idea empirically is to estimate the following augmented
Mincerian regression:
                            log(Wi j ) = α j + β j Si j + γXi j + ui j ,                  (1)
where i and j index individual and state, respectively, W denotes earnings per weekly hours
worked, S denotes years of schooling, X is a vector of control variables that includes gender,
age, age squared, race, and urban residence dummy, and u is an error term. α j is an intercept
that can vary across states, and β j is the return to schooling for individuals working in state
 j.
    Column (1) of Table 3 displays returns to schooling estimates of equation (1). In this
specification the Northeastern states present the highest returns. For example, one additional
year of schooling in Piauí is associated to a 10% increase in earnings. Santa Catarina has the
lowest return, equal to 7%.
    Interpreting these estimates as educational quality measures is problematic because labor
market characteristics vary significantly across Brazilian states, making it possible that two
different markets reward the same schooling quality differently. To overcome this problem,
we use data only on individuals who work in São Paulo but who obtained education in differ-
ent states. Therefore, define now j as state of birth instead of state where individual i works.9
Column (2) of Table 3 provides returns to schooling estimates using only individuals who
work in São Paulo in our baseline sample. For comparison with the previous result, Figure
1 plots estimates for the first two models. Note that the two methods produce very different
estimates. For example, Northeastern states’ estimates are the largest in Model 1, but are the
smallest in Model 2. Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Espírito Santos (ES), Rio Grande do Sul (RS), and
Santa Catarina (SC) also have very distinct estimates. This result is consistent with the idea
that skilled labor is scarce in the poorest states, so that market forces offer a high reward for
education in those regions. After we use data only on individuals that work in the same labor
market, we are able to obtain a superior measure of education quality as valued by market
forces.
    Model 2 estimates are still questionable if we want to interpret returns as educational
quality measures. Earnings in São Paulo are obviously not observed for individuals who
do not work there. If the decision to work in São Paulo is determined by variables that are
correlated to individuals’ years of schooling, estimation of (1) by OLS produces biased and
inconsistent coefficients. Therefore, we use Heckman’s (1979) selection correction method
(Heckit Model) and postulate that earnings in São Paulo are observed if

                                  δ j + ηSi j + φ Xi j + ψEi j + vi j > 0,                                 (2)

where δ j are intercepts that vary across state of birth and Ei j is the (expected) earnings per
hour of individual i if she decides to work in São Paulo in relation to working in another
    9 See Section 2 for a discussion on how the sample was selected so that we can attribute a high probability
that individuals completed schooling in their state of birth.

divided by the expected earnings if she works in another state. For an individual who works
in another state, Ei j equals the expected earnings if she works in São Paulo divided by her
current earnings. To calculate expected earnings we use fitted values of linear regressions.
That is, we first run a series of regressions of earnings per weekly hours on years of schooling,
gender, age, age squared, race, and urban residence dummy for each possible combination of
state of birth and a dummy variable that indicates residence in São Paulo. Then, for example,
the expected earnings of working in São Paulo for an individual who currently has a job in
Rio de Janeiro is computed as the fitted value of the regression that uses data on individuals
who work in São Paulo and were born in Rio de Janeiro. Additionally, we posit that

                     ui j ∼ N(0, σ 2 ),         vi j ∼ N(0, 1),      corr(ui j , vi j ) = ρ.           (3)

    We estimate this model using the Maximum Likelihood method. For comparison, Figure
2 plots estimates for Model 2 and Heckit. Observe that all states have lower estimates in
Heckman’s model, except for São Paulo. This is evidence that migrants are positively selected
and our method corrects the selection bias by increasing São Paulo’s returns in relation to
the other states. Also, except for São Paulo, the vertical difference between estimate and
the 45 degree line is very similar for all states, indicating that selection biases have similar
magnitudes across states.

interpreted as educational quality measures, our main result. Rio de Janeiro and Piauí present
the highest and lowest estimates, respectively. That is, after controlling for selection issues,
if we take two individuals born in Rio de Janeiro that work in São Paulo and have the same
observable characteristics, except for the fact that one has one more year of schooling than
the other, it is expected that the earnings of the more educated individual are 13.1% higher
than the less educated one. In contrast, one additional year of education in Piauí, one of the
poorest states in Brazil, increases earnings by only 2.3%. The Northeast region unambigu-
ously presents the lowest educational quality, while the other regions display heterogeneity.
Mean schooling returns by region are as follows: Northeast 3.4%, Midwest 6.9%, South
8.9%, Southeast 9.7%.
    Table 4 shows elasticities related to the coefficients in the selection equation (2). A one
standard deviation increase in schooling (expected earnings derived from working in São
Paulo in relation to other states) produces a 4.5% (3.2%) higher probability of working in
São Paulo. An individual who is 36 years old presents 0.9% lower probability of working in
São Paulo than an individual who is 35.
    Correlation between error terms estimate is ρ̂ = 0.7, and the p-value associated to the test
ρ = 0 is approximately equal to zero. Therefore, we reject the null and conclude that there is
selection bias in Models 1 and 2 estimates.

3.1    Categorical schooling variable
In the previous analysis we used imputed schooling data because the 2010 census does not
provide the exact number of years of schooling. An alternative to imputation is using a
categorical schooling variable that identifies the following years of schooling intervals: from
0 to 3 years, 4-7, 8-10, 11-14, and 15 years or more. We proceed in two steps. First we
estimate Heckman’s model modifying equation (1) to be

where k assumes the 5 possible values of the categorical schooling variable and Di jk is a
dummy that indicates if individual i’s schooling belongs to interval k. We also use the cat-
egorical schooling variable in the selection equation (2). This step produces 4 schooling
coefficients for each state (one of them is omitted to avoid collinearity). Second, we compute
for each state the weighted mean of schooling coefficients using the fraction of individuals in
each schooling interval as weights. The result is an average of marginal effects for each state.
    Figure 4 plots Heckman’s model estimates using imputed and categorical schooling vari-
ables. Both methods produce qualitatively similar results. Note that averages of marginal
effects have different magnitudes than returns estimated previously. This happens because
those estimates no longer have the interpretation of expected increase in earnings due to one
additional year of schooling.

4    Saeb test scores
In this section we compare returns to schooling, interpreted as educational quality measures,
with Saeb test scores. We use data on Saeb exams applied in the years 1995-2005. To make an
adequate comparison, we re-estimate educational returns using the subsample of individuals
who were probably studying in grades for which the Saeb exams were applied. This amounts
to selecting individuals with age between 24 and 32. For this subsample, there are states for
which there is a very small number of migrants in São Paulo, making educational returns’
standard errors very large for those cases. Because of this we exclude states for which there
are less than 100 migrants, implying that Espírito Santo and Mato Grosso are not included in
this analysis.
    Figure 6 displays standardized returns to schooling and mean Saeb test scores, along with
some correlation statistics. The two measures are highly correlated: the correlation coeffi-
cient equals 0.88 and a one standard deviation increase in return to schooling is associated to
a 82.5% standard deviation increase in Saeb test scores. However, there are significant differ-

ences between both indexes: the Northeast region’s mean Saeb scores are equal to 91.6% of
the others regions’ mean. For the case of our educational quality index, this number equals
30.2%. That is, our measure suggests a larger discrepancy between regions’ educational qual-
ities than Saeb scores do. If we think of our index as the value that market forces assign to
education, this is evidence that there are educational components that the market captures,
but test scores do not.
    Despite differences, the high correlation between both indexes presents evidence that re-
turns to schooling can be used as a proxy variable for educational quality in the case where the
latter is not available. For some countries, educational quality measures are scarce, whereas
data on earnings and schooling are easily available. Therefore, verifying the correlation be-
tween returns to schooling and test scores is relevant for researchers interested in investigat-
ing education themes in developing countries through the construction of education quality
measures.


5    Conclusion
In this paper we provide a new measure of educational quality of Brazilian states in 2010,
based on the idea that the financial returns obtained from an additional year of schooling can
be seen as derived from the value that the market assigns to this education. Using a strategy
similar to Schoellman’s (2012), we use census data on migrants in São Paulo in order to
investigate returns to schooling of individuals who obtained education in different states, but

who work in the same labor market.
    We find that educational quality is very heterogeneous across states. Our index implies
that educational quality is more unequal across states than 1995-2005 Saeb test scores imply.
This is a relevant result for the debate on educational quality in Brazil. Additionally, our
index displays high correlation with Saeb test scores, presenting evidence that returns to
schooling can be used as proxy variable for educational quality in the case where the latter is
not available. This is relevant, for example, for researchers interested in studying education
themes in developing countries.
