    The aim of this paper is to evaluate the e↵ects of political alignment on public health conditions
in Brazil. We adopt a regression discontinuity design, both in its parametric and non-parametric
versions. Our source of exogeneous discontinuity is based on the results of the municipal executive
elections in the years 2004 and 2008, in which the winner and runner-up belonged to opposing
coalitions. This study is a step forward in the related literature since the existing empirical work
has only explored the e↵ect on public spending. Public health condition is measured by health
indicators taken from DATASUS, including infant mortality due to diarrhea, general infant and
maternal mortality rate. The variables related to the elections were taken from the Brazilian Superior
Electoral Court (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, TSE). The main findings point that : i) the discontinuity
observed in the federal transfers and heath indicators varies across political cycles; ii) the e↵ects of
political alignment are more sensitive to the first two years after the elections; iii) the absence
of discontinuities in health care indicators may mean that decision-makers are sensitive to these
indicators, avoiding opportunistic choices.

1    Introduction
History has demonstrated a close relationship between politics and economy and how political goals
a↵ect the behavior of economic variables. According to the theory of Political Cycles, in order to
achieve or remain in power, the political agents must show that they can lead in a way that each
voter can be provided with their essential needs. One way of doing this is through decision-making
at the macroeconomic level on the conduct of the fiscal and monetary policy and its impact on the
voter’s daily life.
    In this regard, over the past few years, several studies have been devoted to understanding this
interrelation between political and economic systems. In the international literature, the works
of Downs (1957), Nordhaus (1975) and Hibbs (1977) demonstrate the existence of cycles caused by
political reasons. Downs (1957), for instance, relates how the political actors’ (parties and candidates)
private interests motivate their choices. According to the author, the economic problem of the
political parties is vote maximization. Thus, policy-making is focused on the achievement of this
objective, that is, the victory in the elections.
    On the other hand, Nordhaus (1975) showed that a pattern of political decisions can be found
when elections happen regularly. His work analyzes the Phillips Curve in nine countries during the
election period in order to check for any control or manipulation of the behavior of two variables:
unemployment and inflation. The result indicated that there is a reduction in unemployment before
the election period with a rise in the inflation rates.
    These two works have contributed to the emergence of the theory of opportunistic political be-
havior, in which the political agent solely seeks to remain in power. Regardless of ideological bias,
the goal is to maximize votes.
    The partisan model (Hibbs, 1977), on the other hand, shows a causal relationship between political
decisions motivated by ideological interests and economic cycles. Thus, political parties committed to
di↵erent interests behave di↵erently, seeking to favor those groups with whom they have the greatest
ideological affinit. In this sense, besides a victory in the elections, governments would be interested
in meeting the demands of the social class that provides greater political support to them and that
somehow is related to the ideologies of the ruling party.
    Rogo↵ and Sibert (1988), based on Nordhaus (1975), proposed the theory of political budget
cycles, in which the focus is on fiscal policies. According to this theory, in election years, govern-
ments increase public spending and transfers, allocate budget funds to short-term and high visibility
projects, besides waiving tax revenues.
    In Brazil, the research on the existence of political-economic cycles has advanced in recent years
due to the democratization processes, the organization of the party system and data reliability.
The studies have been conducted in the three administrative levels (Federal, State and Municipal)
and, in most of them there is empirical evidence suggesting the existence of cycles. The main issues
addressed refer to the opportunistic and partisan e↵ects on spending and private investments (Sakurai
and Gremaud, 2007; Ferreira and Bulgarin, 2007; Nakaguma and Bender, 2010; Novaes and Mattos,
2010; Mendes and Chein,2015). However, most of these studies use panel estimators that, although
having the appropriate treatment to capture the unobservable specific e↵ects of the units treated, do
not guarantee the exogenous e↵ect of the policy cycle on the variables under consideration. Therefore,
any empirical correlation between the political cycle and the variable of interest can be completely
driven by local socioeconomic conditions that a↵ect both the election results and the phenomenon
being focused.
    Considering the importance of health care policies in developing countries, especially in Brazil,
the aim of this article is to investigate the relationship between political alignment and public health
conditions. Therefore, we check whether the expenditure on health care is a↵ected or not by the
political alliances that are formed during the period of elections and whether health indicators are
also a↵ected by these cycles. Given the difficulty of describing the level of health care, it was decided


                                                   2
to use variables related to infant mortality. This indicator is commonly used as a proxy to indicate
the level of health care and socioeconomic development of populations.
    Our empirical strategy is very similar to the one adopted by Brollo and Nannicini (2012) and
Leão, Mello and Ferraz (2012). We use a regression discontinuity approach that exploits the outcomes
of local and general elections held during the period 2004-2012 as a source of within-municipality
variation in political alignment.
    The use of regression discontinuity (RD) aims to advance in the identification of the relationship
between the political alignment and health care, since a comparison between municipalities ruled by
mayors aligned with the president and those with mayors who are not is likely to generate unbiased
estimates due to the problem of endogeneity. The goal is to find an exogenous variation that a↵ects
political alignment, considering only the close races.
    The remainer of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief background on
health care funding in Brazil. The next section presents a descriptive data analysis to support the
treatment applied to the variables selected. Section 4 deals with the methodological description the
models employed, followed by the estimated results. Finally, in Section 5, the main conclusions are
drawn.


2    Health Care Financing in Brazil
The Brazilian Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS) is the official federal health
care institution in the country. The SUS is one of the largest public health systems in the world and
the only one that provides a comprehensive care to the population and is completely free.
    The theoretical basis of the system is the fiscal federalism and decentralization. Federalism refers
to the provision of public goods in a decentralized manner to sub-national governments in order to
allow that levels of public spending are adapted to meet the needs of a heterogeneous population.
Decentralization refers to a transfer of certain administrative and fiscal functions and powers from a
central authority to various local authorities (OATES, 1972).
    The SUS is managed by representatives of each level of government designated to develop execu-
tive functions regarding health. In the national level, it is the Minister of Health; in the state level,
the Secretary of State for Health; and, in the local level, the Municipal Health Secretary. SUS man-
agers are responsible for the coordination, articulation, negotiation, planning, monitoring, control,
evaluation and audit of the health system under their management.
    The legislation that established the SUS also laid the foundations of the federal funds trans-
fer model for sub-national governments as regards the funding for decentralized health actions and
services. In the national level, funding for health actions and services occurs through the intergovern-
mental application and/or transfers of the public funds collected. In the states, the funding system
comes from their resources as well as from transfers from the federal level. In the municipalities,
in addition to their resources, funding depends on federal and state transfers. Municipalities are
responsible for the formulation of the municipal health care policy, planning, complementary regu-
lation, direct control and provision of direct and health care services or through referrals to other
towns.
    The legislation governing the SUS establishes that fund transfers (fund to fund) occur regularly
and automatically from the National Health Fund (Fundo Nacional de Saúde) to the State Health
Funds (Fundos Estaduais de Saúde) and Municipal Funds (Fundos Municipais de Saúde, FMS).
These transfers must comply with various criteria, such as the demographic and epidemiological
profile of the population, the characteristics of the health services network, performance in the
previous period of time, the budget of municipal and state funds for health care, investment forecast,
and compensation paid to other spheres of government regarding health care.
    The several mechanisms and criteria regarding fund transfers to SUS determine di↵erent capabil-
ities for the redistribution of resources among states and municipalities. Each transfer mechanism is

                                                   3
linked, to a greater or lesser extent, to the installed and production capacity of public and private ser-
vices accredited to the existing SUS in a given jurisdiction. According to Lima (2007), this structure
helps to accentuate socioeconomic inequalities in a context of scarce resources for health care and has
shaped the positioning of federal actors as well as cooperation and conflict relationships, stimulating
the creation of new criteria and mechanisms of redistribution of federal funds since the late 1990s.
Due to that, the authors believe that the health care policy is developing its own mechanisms, and
they interact in a specific context, with structural and institutional variables that are difficult to be
changed by the actors who work in the health care sector.


3      Descriptive Analysis of the Data
The database includes information from 5,569 municipalities, and the findings refer to 2004-2012.
This article does not deal with compared minimum areas so as not to lose information related
to election variables and their resulting impact on the scope of this article. In the regressions,
the municipalities created after 2005 have been excluded, as well as the municipalities that have
originated them, with a final total of 5,548 municipalities being included in the study.

3.1    Brazilian political scene
The initial analysis aims to describe the political scenario in the reference period. The variables
concerning the elections that are being assessed are: candidates and winners in municipal and national
elections, their parties and the number of votes obtained. From this information, it is possible to
build other variables describing the election process. The base variable of political control in the
study is a dummy one used to indicate the alignment between the party of the mayor and that of the
president. The value of 1 is assigned to this variable if the parties are the same, and 0 if otherwise.
This strategy was adopted based on the empirical model by Leão, Mello and Ferraz (2012) and
Videira and Mattos (2011).
    Brazil is a democratic republic with three levels of government, namely: central, regional and
local. The central government is formed by the President and the National Congress, comprising
the House of Representatives and the Federal Senate. The regional government has representation
in each of the 26 states and the Federal District, which are under the leadership of the Governor and
of the Legislative Assembly. In the local level, the public representatives of the people are the Mayor
- the largest local authority - and the City Council.
    The country has adopted a multi-party system in which the various parties can take leadership
throughout the territory and in the three levels of government. Governance is ensured only when the
most representative member of the executive branch has the administrative support of the majority
of the members in the chambers of the legislative branch. Therefore, there are often coalitions
between parties in order to ensure the approval of projects and bills as well as the control over the
bureaucratic apparatus available to the executive branch.
    It is worth highlighting that there is a di↵erence in the Brazilian electoral calendar regarding
the dispute of positions in the central, regional and local governments, generating an overlapping
of electoral cycles between levels. As a consequence, each elected member of government in the
executive branch serves the equivalent to two mayoral mandates and vice versa. Two election cycles
are analyzed in this article. The first cycle refers to the 2004 municipal elections from 2005 to 2008,
while the second one is related to the outcome of the electoral process of 2008, which elected the
mayors who served between 2009 and 2012. During that time, there was no party change in the
central government, although there were three democratic electoral processes for the presidential
post (the 2002, 2006 and 2010 elections), with the Workers’ Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT)
being the ruling party.


                                                    4
    In the period before the 2004 electoral process, 3.28%, or 182 municipalities, were governed by
mayors who belonged to the same party as the president elected in 2002. After the closing of the
electoral process, 7.25% (402 municipalities) were administered by mayors aligned with the central
government. In the 2008 election cycle, 9.73% of the municipalities (540) were managed by mayors
aligned with the central government. The 2010 central elections brought little change to the political
landscape, with a drop of 0.03 percentage points in the total of aligned municipalities.
    It is useful to evaluate the level of competitiveness of the electoral process between candidates who
were aligned and those not aligned with the central government. Out of the total of municipalities
analyzed, it turns out that in 1902 municipalities, i.e. 34.28% of the sample, the di↵erence of votes
between aligned and non-aligned candidates in the 2004 elections was 10%. In 968 municipalities, or
17.45% of the sample, the di↵erence of votes between those candidates is 5%. For the 2008 election
cycle, considering the di↵erence of votes of up to 10%, 29.16% of the sample is represented, i.e., 1618
municipalities. In 892 municipalities, or 16.08%, the di↵erence in votes between the aligned and
non-aligned candidates was up to 5%.

3.2    Health care spending
Financial and budgetary data on health care are captured by the variables Discretionary Transfers
of Federal SUS allocated to the Municipality, Transfers of Federal SUS-allocated Funds to the Mu-
nicipality (fund to fund transfers, i.e. from the National Health Care Fund to the Municipal Health
Care Fund) and Discretionary Transfers of Capital Resources of SUS allocated to the Municipality.
These transferences are handled separately by relevance account to subject, by the celebration of
agreements, transfers of contracts and mainly Fund to Fund transfers.
    In addition, we include variables related to general transfers from the federal government to
municipalities: Discretionary Transfers of the Current Resources, Transfers of Capital Resources and
Discretionary Transfers of Capital Resources of the Federal Government allocated to the Municipality.
We focus on these types of federal transfers because their allocation mechanism depends on the
support of federal government. All data have been taken from a database called FINBRA - Finances
of Brazil - which is under the responsibility of the National Treasury (Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional,
STN).
    Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of variables for the period that includes the 2004 and 2008
cycles. The values are in BRL and have been deflated using the IGP-DI index (Base year: 2012).

   Concerning the health care indicators, given the difficulty of describing the level of health care,
we decided to use variables related to infant mortality. This indicator is commonly used as a proxy

to indicate the level of health care and socioeconomic development of populations. There are several
books discussing the validity of its use (Leal and Szwarcwald, 1996; Reidpath and Allotey, 2003; and
Akachi and Canning, 2009). Among the limitations to its use as a health indicator, these stand out:
(a) it reflects an incomplete history of the disease; (b) diseases that weaken, but do not lead to death
are not represented; and (c) deaths are events that express only the maximum severity.
    The health care indicators of the municipalities were taken from the database in their absolute
form and transformed into rates per inhabitant. For the years 2004-2005, the reference population
used was the one accounted for in the 2000 census; for the following years, the information from
the 2010 census was used. Chart 1 provides a brief description of the health care variables selected.
In addition of these variables, we also consider the variables related to number of physicians and
hospital beds and the immunization coverage. Our goal is to verify that the opportunistic actions
due to political alignment also a↵ect the provision of health services.

    Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the health-dependent variables related to the 2004 and
2008 cycles, and the total average of the period.
    Infant mortality rate due to diarrhea in children under one year of age decreased by 27% between
the 2004 and 2008 cycles. The overall average for the period was 1.47 deaths per 1,000 live births. The
statistics on the average rate of overall infant mortality in children under one year of age decreased
by 16.11% between the 2004 and 2008 cycles, reaching 16 deaths per 1,000 live births.
    Maternal mortality rate remained stable during the period being studied. During that time, 0.6
deaths of mothers during labor per thousand live births were recorded.
    The Physicians varied between 8 and 10 doctors per thousand inhabitants between 2004 and 2008
cycles, in both cycles, the number of Physicians were increased when we compare the initial and final
period of political cycles.
    Hospital beds rate and immunization coverage remained stable during 19   the period being studied.

mayors are from the same party as the president receive more resources than those municipalities that
are not aligned. As mentioned earlier, empirical studies have shown the impact of political alliances

    Regarding health variables, the tests of di↵erences between means are not significant. Contrary to
expectations, aligned municipalities have, on average, a higher rate of infant deaths. The di↵erence
reaches on Physicians indicates that mayors aligned have more 0.5 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants. In
addition, the municipalities administered by the same political party as that of the president have a
higher rate of hospital beds. Table 3 contains the complete results.

4     Empirical Strategy
The regression discontinuity design is a quasi-experimental empirical strategy widely used in eco-
nomics and other social sciences (IMBENS and LEMIEUX, 2008; LEE and LEMIEUX, 2010). Thus,
the empirical strategy adopted in this article aims to advance the identification of the relationship
between political alignment and health care. The traditional methods (estimated in a panel) when
comparing municipalities ruled by mayors aligned with the president and those whose mayors are
not aligned are likely to generate biased estimates due to the problem21of endogeneity, since the local
health care policies o↵ered can be correlated with specific characteristics, such as transfers of funds
related to the installed capacity of the municipalities, and this could also influence the political cycle.
    The variable Sit (1) is defined as the level of potential health care of the municipality i if the mayor
is aligned with the president, and Sit (0) as the level of potential health care of the same municipality
i if the mayor is not aligned with the president, in a specific period t. The aim is to estimate the
di↵erence in the potential outcome of a close race between aligned and non-aligned mayors, i.e.
E[Sit (1) Sit (0)Xi = x], where Xi is the variable that determines whether the municipality i will
receive the treatment (Xi x) or not (Xi < x) . The problem of the causal inference established is
that it is not possible to find the two results at the same time. In other words, it is impossible to
measure the level of health care for the same municipality if it is managed by a mayor who is aligned
with the president or by one who is not.
    The understanding of the identification strategy is that in cities where the mayoral candidates
aligned with the president who won the elections by a narrow margin of votes against a non-aligned
candidate can be a good counterfactual for those municipalities where the opposite occurred (a
mayoral candidate who is not aligned defeated an aligned candidate by a narrow margin of votes).

                                                                                      7
In this sense, the identification is based on the assumption that random factors in closely fought
elections are crucial to deciding who the winner is. Therefore, the probability of winning is the same
for candidates, the one aligned and the one not aligned with the president.
    The variable Alipresit defines the status of the treatment: Alipresit = 1 if the mayor belongs to
the same party of the president, i.e., is aligned with him, and Alipresit = 0, if otherwise. The result
observed is Sit = Alipresit ⇤ Sit (1) + (1 Alipresit ) ⇤ Sit (0). The estimator of interest is the Average
Treatment E↵ect (AT E), E[Sit (1) Sit (0)], defined for the population of interest.
    In this case, the population of interest includes only the municipalities where the dispute for
the position of mayor involved candidates of opposing coalitions, i.e., the municipalities in which
either the winners or the runner-ups in municipal elections belong to the same party as the central
government. The treatment group consists of the municipalities where the allied mayor was elected
to compete with candidates who are not allied with the president. The assignment of the treatment
can be formalized as:

                                        M arginit = 1[M Vit         0]                                (1)
    wherein M Vit is the margin of victory of the candidate aligned with the president in the mu-
nicipality i during the period t and 1 [.] is an indicator function. This function is specified as the
di↵erence between the percentage of valid votes of the aligned candidate and the percentage of valid
votes of the unaligned candidate, which means that this value will be positive if the aligned candidate
wins the election. Therefore, this measure is greater than zero if the mayor is aligned and less than
zero if otherwise. In the limit, when M Vit = 0, the alignment Alipresit changes abruptly from zero
to one. M Vit can be seen as a random variable, in accordance with the observed and unobserved
variables, and as random events that can occur on the election day. The standard regression discon-
tinuity approach assumes that the potential results should be continuous functions of the margin of
victory (M V ) at its limit (Angrist and Pischke, 2009). This article tests this hypothesis:
    The AT E in the election period is:

                          = E[Sit (1)   Sit (0)|M Vit = 0] = lim Yit            lim Yit               (2)
                                                                M Vit #0       M Vit "0

     is defined as the local e↵ect since it captures the impact of the alignment between a mayor and
the president on health care only in cities where M Vit was close to zero.
   In order to estimate the AT E, the authors have chosen a local linear approach (Angrist and
Pischke, 2009) which restricts the sample to municipalities where M Vit 2 [ h, +h] and the estimation
model is:

                   Sit = ⇢0 + ⇢1 M Vit +   0 Alipresit   +   1 Alipresit   ⇤ M Vit +      t   + "it   (3)
    in which standard errors are grouped by municipal level and b0 identifies the AT E in the limit of
M Vit = 0. According to Angrist and Pischke (2009), since the result of interest of the discontinuous
regression is on a small neighborhood to the left and to the right of M Vit , the estimate of the mean
e↵ect of the treatment is not dependent on the correct specification of the function. The discontinuity
regressions tested in this article were linear, quadratic and cubic in shape.
    However, the methodological difficulty is to determine a value of h that characterizes the close
race and that ensures precision and no bias in the estimates. Thus, the estimation of the regression
discontinuity design may occur through the parametric and the nonparametric methods. In Brazil,
Leão, Mello and Ferraz (2010) use the parametric method to estimate the e↵ect of the alignment
between mayors and the president on federal bank lending. According to Lee and Lemieux (2010),
the non-parametric specification should be used when there is a reason to believe that the true model
is non-linear. The poor specification of the functional form generates bias on the treatment e↵ect.
Since Hahn, Todd and van der Klaauw (2001), the regression discontinuity (RD) estimation can


                                                     8
generally be interpreted as an RD-related estimation problem.
    The conventional non-parametric estimators based on the kernel method depend on the choice of
bandwidth. Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) argue that even the estimators of the existing
bandwidth selectors (Imbens and Kalyanaram, 2012; Fan and Gijbels, 1996), based on the balancing
of the squared bias and on the variance of the regression discontinuity estimator tend determine
wider bandwidths to ensure the validity of the distribution. Thus, these bandwidth selectors lead
to considerable bias in the approximations of the distribution of the estimator. As a result, the
confidence intervals estimated by the RD treatment e↵ect may be biased, having empirical coverage
well below its nominal target. In other words, the conventional confidence intervals can substantially
over-reject the null hypothesis for the absence of the treatment-e↵ect.
    The alternative proposed by Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014) is to build more robust
confidence intervals, starting with the treatment-e↵ect estimators of the regression discontinuity
for bias correction. Intuitively, these estimators are not a good fit for small samples because the

5     Results
The results are presented by political cycle. The section 5.1 refers to the results of the political cycle
2004 and section 5.2 refers to the results of the estimations for the political cycle 2008. The analysis
of political cycles was carried out in two stages in order to capture the design of the Brazilian electoral
calendar. Initially, we analyze the first two years of each cycle, the run-up to federal elections. We
then test the same variables for the final year of each cycle, the run-up to local elections in that elect
the mayors of each municipality.

   According to our identification strategy, we first check for opportunistic actions on the transfer of
central government funds to the municipalities aligned. After that, we check if the alignment a↵ect‘s
the provision of health care services, as part of the discretionary resources not linked to SUS can be
used to promote actions within the system. Finally, in order to fulfill the objectives proposed by this
paper, we analyze the e↵ects of alignment on health indicators, represented by mortality rates.

5.1     Political Cycle of 2004
5.1.1   Federal Transfers and Transferences of SUS funds
Regarding the election period after the 2004 cycle, it was found that there was discontinuity for
the parametric approach in discretionary Transfers of Capital Resources. The e↵ect of alignment
on this variable expressed in logarithmic form is about 333.33%. The figure 1 illustrates this point.
In the linear specification of the polynomial, municipalities where the mayors are aligned with the
president receive on average 15.71% more than those who lost close races in the relation of variable
ldt1. For ldt4, the e↵ect of political alignment is about 13.28%. In the non-parametric approaches,
these e↵ects cannot be identified.
    For nonparametric approach the e↵ect of alignment between the president and mayors on discre-
tionary Transfers of Federal Government variable have negative signal for conventional and robust
model. This result is counterintuitive and deserves a deeper analysis in the future.

    Table 5 shows the results of the final period of cycle 2004. In the parametric approach, the
discretionary Transfers of Capital Resources remains significant in three specifications of the poly-
nomial. Aligned municipalities receive on average 112.5 % more capital resources from the federal
level through agreements. This result is significant at 1 % . In the nonparametric24 approach, only
this variable was significant. The e↵ect of alignment is achieved of 266 % more.
    Transfers of direct agreements for SUS also showed sensitivity to alignment variable. Showing
that on the eve of municipal elections, the aligned municipalities receive around 149 % more resources
than the non-aligned, according to the linear specification. Transfers to SUS are significant to 5 %.
Aligned mayors received about 41 % more resources to their municipalities at the end of the policy
cycle in 2004.Full results are available in Table 6 and Table 7.

5.1.2   Health Care Services Provision
Once found evidence of opportunistic actions on the transfer of federal funds to municipalities that
belong to the same party as the president, intends to verify if the political alignment a↵ects the
provision of services to the population. As health services o↵er proxy variables were used, number
of physicians and hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants and Immunization Coverage.
    In relation to the initial period of the cycle 2004, it appears that only the variable Immuniza-
tion Coverage presents significant result in the 10% significance level. The Immunization Coverage
between aligned municipalities is on average 1.11% higher, in parametric approach with linear spec-
ification. In nonparametric approach the sensitivity of the data improves.
    The variable Physicians indicates that on average the aligned municipalities have 2-3 more doctors
per thousand inhabitants than the non-aligned to the central government. This result was identified
in three specifications of the polynomial by the conventional method. The Figure 2 illustrates these
di↵erences. In the estimation method for robust confidence intervals, the linear specification of the
polynomial does not detect di↵erences between aligned and unaligned.

    Although for the nonparametric approach, the Immunization Coverage has indicated there e↵ect
between the political alignment and the provision of this service, the signal e↵ect is negative. This
result suggests that there is some disadvantage in o↵ering this service to the population located in
aligned municipalities.
    The variable Hospital beds is significant by nonparametric approach by the two methods in the
estimation of confidence intervals, on the quadratic and cubic specification of the polynomial. The
results indicate that the aligned municipalities have on average 3 to 4 hospital beds more than the
municipalities not aligned to the central government, with 5% significance level.
    At the end of the 2004 election cycle, it appears that the e↵ect 27of political alignment for the
hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants was significant for the parametric approach to quadratic and cubic
specifications of the polynomial. However, the signal e↵ect is negative and the value of the e↵ect is
around 0.5%. The same happens with the doctor per thousand inhabitants. In the nonparametric
approach, the sign of the e↵ect of political alignment on the Immunization Coverage is ambiguous;
positive is presented only for the cubic and negative specification for other specifications.
    The e↵ect of alignment between mayors and president for Hospital beds at the end of the cycle
in 2004 is expected, indicating that aligned municipalities have on average 4 hospital beds more per

    In relation to Overall Infant Mortality Rate, the e↵ect of the political alignment between the
local and central governments is greater. Aligned municipalities have on average 8 to 10 deaths less
per thousand live births. These results are valid with significance level of 5%. The advantage of

the nonparametric approach is to decrease the probability of over-reject the null hypothesis. For the
variable Maternal Mortality Rate , the results were not significant at any of approaches.
    Regarding the final period of the 2004 cycle (prior to municipal elections) it was found that there
were no significant results for health indicators in any of the approaches. The only significant result
refers to the variable Mortality rate due to diarrhea, the parametric approach to linear specification.
According to this result, municipalities where the mayors are aligned to the president have an average
infant death from diarrhea in thousand live births. While this result has been found is a weak evidence
that there are health e↵ect on this indicator. The complete results are shown in Tables 10 and 11.

5.2.1   Federal Transfers and Transference of SUS funds
The results for the initial period of the 2008 cycle were not significant. The only e↵ect was found for
variable Discretionary Transfers of Capital Resources in nonparametric approach. According to this
result , the municipalities where mayors are aligned to the central government received 275% more
capital resources through agreements.
    At the end of the period to variable Discretionary Transfers of Federal Government was significant,
at level 10% , for the parametric approach only in the linear specification. Still, the e↵ect was negative
for the aligned, against the theoretical assumptions. In the nonparametric approach, the e↵ect on
the variable Transfers of Capital Resources is ambiguous. The e↵ect is positive for the quadratic

5.2.2   Heath Care Service Provision
The variables of heath care showed no significant result for the parametric approach 36   in the 2008
cycle, in both periods . Only the variable Hospital beds proved relevant to the end of the cycle .
The e↵ect of alignment indicates that municipalities aligned with the president have on average 0.7
hospital beds more than not aligned with significance of 10 %.
    In the nonparametric approach , the results for the variable Physicians have become more sensitive
to alignment both at the beginning and end of the cycle . However, the e↵ect of the signal is negative,
contrary to the theoretical assumption . The variable Hospital beds also had the sign of negative in
both periods . The Immunization Coverage also had a negative sign for the purpose of alignment
with the central government , but only for the second period. Results are showed in table 16 and
table 17.

5.2.3    Health Care Indicators
Table 18 and 19 show the results of political alignment on health indicators. At the end of the
cycle 2008, there is a decrease in the Maternal Mortality Rate to municipalities aligned in the non
parametric estimates. On the other side, the e↵ect of alignment on the variable Overall Infant
Mortality Rate was positive in the initial period of this cycle. The average e↵ect is 11 to 12 deaths
per 1,000 live births. In the final period there was no statistical significance for this variable.
   For all variables, except the Maternal Mortality rate, there was no significant e↵ect of alignment
on health indicators in the parametric approach.

The aim of this article was to analyze how the political alignments influence health care in Brazilian
municipalities. The theory of political cycles studies, within a democratic political system, how the
political choices of governments a↵ect economic variables. This influence can occur through the
practice of opportunistic actions, in which the decisions of the elected members of government seeks
only to maintaining their power or in which political actions are taken solely to meet the aspirations
of specific groups (seeing this through the ideological-partisan point of view).
    This article contributes to the literature on political cycles by adopting a di↵erentiated identifi-
cation strategy through the use of the regression discontinuity design for the analysis of the e↵ect of
political alignment on health care in Brazilian municipalities. This estimator, which accommodates

the presence of unobserved variable and fixed factors in time, shows that the mayors who are po-
litically aligned with the president and who participated in closely fought elections tend to receive
more on federal transfers in the two first two years after the elections.
     We found that the main variable that allows opportunistic actions of politicians is the discre-
tionary transfer of capital resources between the central and municipal government. The funds
received exclusively for the SUS have little sensitivity to political alliances, since they are deter-
mined by specific legislation. Thus, according to our analysis, the resources for health in Brazil are
not subject to strong electoral manipulation. However, there is still a channel through which it is
possible to opportunistic allocation of resources.
     The estimates found increased health service provision at the beginning of the election cycle of
2004, more than in 2008. Regarding health indicators there was low sensitivity of such data to the
political alignment. This can be attributed to the fact that these variables are long-term policy
dependent and are correlated with people’s health habits. Many of the estimates found e↵ects with
the sign opposite to that indicated by the literature, it is believed that this fact may be correlated
with the extent of policy e↵ects.
     The strategy of dividing the electoral cycles in periods allow us to identify di↵erent behaviors
according to the electoral calendar. The e↵ects of alignment to the central government are more
sensitive in the run-up to presidential election, i.e., the first two years of each cycle. This is strong
evidence that the political actions aimed at maintaining power.
     The comparison between the estimates of the political cycles of 2004 and 2008 show that the data
for 2004 are more sensitive to alignment than 2008. Among the possible hypotheses, it is considered
that a possible e↵ect of the financial crisis in 2008 can have contributed to a slight adjustment
of public accounts. The political cycle 2008 includes the period of development of new four-year
planning (PPA 2008-2011-Plano Prurianual). In addition, this period is no longer possible to re-
election, ending his second term. Even with the party’s maintenance of Workers (PT) in the central
government in the years 2011 and 2012, the Brazilian electorate is characterized by personalism.
     Among the limitations of the article, these stand out: i) the difficulty of condensing the complexity
of the concept of health care into a number of relevant variables. Even if that were possible, there
would still be the problem of data reliability, since the information system is powered by its local
health care managers, and many of these municipalities are linked to a management ?pact? with the
states where the release of funds is linked to the achievement of goals; ii) the e↵ect of time and the
behavior of individuals regarding health. Some variables are sensitive to short-term policies, whereas
others need investment maturation to be changed. The rulers do not control habits, beliefs, values,
and behaviors of individuals regarding their health status.
