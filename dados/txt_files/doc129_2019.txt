           O mercado dos EUA é a referência para as finanças empíricas e é considerado
       o exemplo mais próximo de um mercado eficiente. Por outro lado, resultados
       divergentes dos observados nos EUA estão frequentemente considerados não confiáveis
       devido aos possíveis desvios das hipóteses de eficiência de mercado. No entanto,
       como os resultados do mercado norte-americano se comportariam se os dados fossem
       submetidos as mesmas restrições de uma economia emergente? Para responder a
       essa pergunta, analisamos a estimativa de prêmios de risco sob as restrições típicas
       dos mercados de ações emergentes: o baixo número de ativos e curto histórico de
       dados. Utilizamos como referência os parâmetros de tamanho da amostra, número
       de ativos e distribuição de variáveis contábeis do mercado acionário brasileiro.
       Surpreendentemente, concluímos que os prêmios de risco dos EUA apresentam as
       mesmas características que as obtidas com dados brasileiros quando sob as mesmas
       restrições de tempo. Em seguida, avaliamos as duas possíveis causas decorrentes
       do T pequeno: i) viés de pequenas amostras nos betas e ii) divergência entre os
       prêmios de risco ex-post e ex-ante. Através de simulações de Monte Carlo, concluímos
       que com T de aproximadamente 5 anos as estimativas dos beta não são mais um
       problema. No entanto, é necessário analisar uma série temporal superior a 40 anos
       para se obter um prêmio de risco ex-ante robusto.

            USA market is the benchmark for empirical finance and considered the closest
       example of how an efficient market should behave. On the other hand, divergent
       results from the observed in the USA are often associated with unreliable and due
       deviations from efficient hypothesis. However, how would the US market results
       behave had the data the same constraints as an emerging market economy? To
       answer that question we analyze the risk premia market estimation under the typical
       constraints from emerging equity markets: the small number of assets and the short
       time-series sample available for estimation. We use parameters of time-series length,
       number of assets and accounting variables distribution from the Brazilian equity
       market. Surprisingly, we conclude that the US market risk premia convey the same
       data features as the Brazilian risk premia if under the same time constraints. Then,
       we evaluate two potential causes of problems in risk premia estimations with small
       T : i) small sample bias on betas, and ii) divergence between ex-post and ex-ante risk
       premia. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that for the T around 5
       years the beta estimates are no longer a problem. However, it is necessary to analyze
       a time-series sample exceeding 40 years to obtain robust ex-ante risk premia.

1        Introduction
    The estimation results of emerging markets risk premia show no consensus in the
literature.2 The estimation results of Brazilian risk premia, for instance, not only disagree
with the US and developed markets results but also vary among themselves. The Brazilian
risk premia estimates collected from several studies3 and presented in Figure 1 illustrate
this lack of consensus.
    The estimates in Figure 1 are obtained by exploring many sub-periods between 1976
and 2015 and by applying a variety of techniques4 . The estimates of the market (Mkt)
risk premium are positive in 41 cases, negative in 18 cases, and not significant in 74 cases.
The size (SMB) risk premium does not present any positive and statistically significant
estimates. The value (HML) risk premium presents the most robust estimates. Of the 88
estimates, 46 are positive and significant, and only 2 are significant and negative. Finally,
there are 26 estimates for the momentum (WML) risk premium, but only a few cases are
significant, with three positives and one negative.
    This lack of consensus is normally attributed to deviations from efficient hypothesis or
imperfections on the emerging markets. In light of these circumstances, we turn to the US
data and estimate risk premia under the restrictions faced by a typical emerging stock
market. We chose the US since the explanatory power of risk factors in this market is
widely validated and accepted by the literature and we apply the restrictions observed for
the Brazilian market as reference for a typical emerging market.
    First, we analyze the sensitivity of the US risk premia estimations on two relevant
constraints present in emerging stock market: the small number of assets (small 𝑁 ) and
the short time-series samples (small 𝑇 ).5,6

      Grandes et al. (2010) find that the size and value premiums are not statistically significant in the
stock markets of Latin America. Chui and Wei (1998) find in Pacific-Basin emerging markets (Hong
Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand) a weak relationship between average returns and beta,
a value premium in three of the markets, and size premium in four of the markets. Barry et al. (2002)
investigate the size and value effects in 35 emerging markets and find evidence of a value premium, but
not robust evidence for the size premium. Cakici et al. (2013) examine 18 emerging stock markets from
Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe and find strong evidence for the value effect in the whole sample,
momentum effect for all markets but Eastern Europe, and very weak evidence for size effect. Bauman
et al. (1998) find evidence of both the size and value premiums for a range of Asian stock markets. Foye
et al. (2013) test the three-factor model in the European Union markets and find a value premium, but
no size premium. On the other hand, Lischewski and Voronkova (2012) examine only Polish stocks and
report that the market, size, and value factors have explanatory power on average returns, but do not
explain portfolio returns fully.

    The figure shows the dispersion in the estimations of market (Mkt), size (SMB), value (HML),
    and momentum (WML) risk premia in the Brazilian stock market. The figure shows a
    box-plot for each risk factor, and each circle represents one reported estimation (% p.m.).
    The box-plot reports the 0th , 25th , 50th , 75th , and 100th percentiles. The numbers within the
    brackets to the right of the 0th and 100th percentiles are the number of negative and positive
    estimates of each factor respectively. The higher the t-value reported, the larger the circle.
    A significant estimate (|t-value| ≥ 1.64) is indicated by a blue circle. The coordinate axis
    reports the factor’s name followed by the number of estimates reported.

    We conclude that the restriction imposed by the small T is more relevant than that
imposed by the small N. While Brazilian data offer values of T over 14 years, our analysis
indicates that it is necessary to analyze a time-series sample using data exceeding 40 years
to obtain robust risk premia estimates. On the other hand, values of N as observed for
the Brazilian market do not pose an issue.
    Given these results, we then investigate the problems caused by the small T. One
problem could be the use of poorly estimated betas in the second stage of the estimation.
Another problem could be the use of poorly estimated expected returns of stocks. Both
would induce errors in the estimation of the risk premia. Poorly estimated betas generate
biased risk premia estimates. Poorly estimated expected returns lead to the estimation of
ex-post instead of ex-ante risk premia.7
    To assess the relative importance of these two issues, we perform Monte Carlo simula-
tions. We conclude that the most important issue is the use of poorly estimated expected


was often set to very high levels, and before 1994 the Brazilian economy has faced a strong inflationary
period. The results obtained after including data from the period between 1994 and 1999 remain the same
and are presented in Appendix A, which can be provided under requested. Therefore, to estimate the risk
premia in Brazil, one commonly uses data beginning in the year 2000.

     The ex-ante risk premium is the excess return that the investor expects to receive when investing in
the asset. This is the value to be estimated. The ex-post risk premium is the realized excess return after
shocks.

returns. Indeed, the difference between ex-post and ex-ante risk premia proves to be
significant when the estimation is performed with small T. For instance, when data are
simulated using a market risk premia of 0.65% p.m., we estimate a positive and significant
risk premium in only 17% of the samples if T is set at 14.
    To the best of our knowledge nobody has restricted the US data to understand how
they behave. By adopting such a procedure, we show that data behavior of emerging
market economies are not that awkward. By contrast, we are able to show that the US
data behavior is not robust by shortening the sample. We also conclude that it takes many
years (roughly 40 years) to safely estimate the ex-ante risk premia. Therefore, anyone
interested in computing the cost of equity for firms in emerging economies should use the
local data only to estimate the betas. In turn, the price of risk should be taken from data
with longer time-series sample, US data, for instance.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset,
followed by the first analysis of portfolios and risk factors. Section 3 presents the factor
model we use in the estimation as well as the methodology supporting it. Section 4
compares the premia results for the US with those found for Brazilian markets (4.1),
followed by the analysis of the impact of estimating risk premia with a small number
of assets (4.2) and with small time-series samples (4.3). This section ends with the
assessment of the consequences of estimating risk premia with small time-series samples
(4.4). Section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the findings and its implications.


2        Data
    The main paper’s datasets consist of monthly portfolio returns from and risk factors of
the Brazilian and the US stock markets. The US information is obtained from French’s
website8 and covers the period between January 1927 and December 2014. The Brazilian
information is taken from the Brazilian Center for Research in Financial Economics of
the University of São Paulo (NEFIN) website and covers the period from January 2001 to
December 2014. The Brazilian stock market was already operational prior to this period.
However, until 1999, the risk-free rate was used as an instrument of the pegged exchange
rate regime, and it was often set to very high levels. Therefore, to estimate the risk premia
in Brazil, one commonly uses data beginning in the year 2000. The US portfolio and risk
factor returns are value-weighted, while the Brazilian ones are equally weighted9 .
    The 22 portfolios used in this work are presented in Table 1. This table is organized as
follows. The first column shows the variables used to arrange the assets into portfolios.
The second column names each portfolio, the third and fourth columns contain the
percentiles used as breakpoints for the construction of the portfolios, the fifth and sixth
columns report the means of the portfolios’ returns, and, finally, the last two columns list
the autocorrelation consistent standard deviations. The data available at NEFIN’s and
French’s websites have different numbers of portfolios. Therefore, in order to conduct a
fair comparison between the Brazilian and the US markets, some portfolios are combined
by calculating their value-weighted returns. The first 17 portfolios are defined based on
information about Size, Book-to-market, and Momentum, and the other portfolios are

     Table 1 shows that the US portfolios’ returns are negatively correlated with Size and
positively correlated with Book-to-market and Momentum, as described in the literature
(Fama and French, 1992, 1993; Carhart, 1997). The Brazilian portfolios also generally
exhibit the same behavior as those of the US market. However, three points require
attention: i) the Book-to-market effect is not observable among the Big High and Big Low
portfolios, since Big High presents an average return of 0.08, which is smaller than the
average return of 0.15 for Big Low, ii) the Size effect is also not observed between the
Big Loser and Small Loser portfolios, since the Small Loser has lower average return, and
iii) none of the Brazilian portfolios’ returns have a significant average.
     Besides the mentioned portfolios, we use four risk factors and a risk-free rate for each
economy. Table 2 presents the mean and standard deviation of those variables. The
names used for each factor are provided in the first column. They are Mkt for the Market
factor, SMB for the Size factor, HML for Book-to-market, and WML for Momentum. The
risk-free rate used for the US is the Treasury bill month rate, and for the Brazilian market,
we use the 30-day Deposito Interbancário (DI) swap rate.
     Again the variables for the US follow the pattern documented in the literature, that is,
all factors have positive and statistically significant return averages. On the other hand,

3     Methodology of risk premium estimation
   This section explains how the risk premium is estimated. In order to do so, we first
present the multi-factor model in subsection 3.1, and then explain the methodology for
the model estimation.

3.1     Multi-factor model
   Define 𝐾 as the number of risk factors, 𝑁 as the number of assets, and 𝑇 as the
number of observed periods. The multi-factor model assumes that excess asset returns are
governed by the following linear relation:

                                           𝐸(𝑅𝑖𝑒 ) = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑖′ 𝜆                                  (1)

where 𝑅𝑖𝑒 is the excess return of an asset 𝑖 ∈ {1, 2, ..., 𝑁 }, 𝛼 is the model pricing error, 𝜆
is a 𝐾x1 vector with the risk premia for the 𝐾 factors, and 𝛽𝑖 is a 𝐾x1 vector with the
risk measures of asset 𝑖 for each factor.
    The model also proposes that the 𝛽𝑖 vector respect the following relation in the time
series:
                                    𝑅𝑖𝑡𝑒 = 𝑎𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖′ 𝑓𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡                                (2)
where 𝑅𝑖𝑡𝑒 is the excess return of asset 𝑖 in period 𝑡 ∈ {1, 2, ..., 𝑇 }, 𝑎𝑖 is the expected pricing
error of asset 𝑖, 𝑓𝑡 is a 𝐾𝑥1 vector with the realizations of the factors in period 𝑡, and 𝜖𝑖𝑡
is the random error of asset 𝑖 in period 𝑡.

3.2     Risk premium estimation
    The model estimation is conducted using the GMM methodology introduced by Hansen
(1982), with a similar framework proposed by Cochrane (2001). This methodology provides

                                                   6
a joint estimation of all parameters of the model and easily handles the problems of serial
correlation and conditional heteroscedasticity.
    The GMM estimation is based on the hypotheses derived from the model’s introduction
in Section 3.1. We can build the following matrix using the model’s assumptions:

                                           (𝑅𝑡𝑒 − 𝑎 − 𝛽𝑓𝑡 )
                                     ⎡                                ⎤

                    𝑔𝑡 (𝑎, 𝛽, 𝛼, 𝜆) = ⎣ [(𝑅𝑡𝑒 − 𝑎 − 𝛽𝑓𝑡 ) ⊗ 𝑓𝑡 ] ⎦                                   (3)
                                      ⎢                          ⎥

                                       [1, 𝛽 ′ ] [(𝑅𝑡𝑒 − 𝛼 − 𝛽𝜆)] ([𝑁 +𝑁 𝐾+1+𝐾]x1)

where 𝑅𝑡𝑒 is the 𝑁 x1 vector of excess returns in period 𝑡, 𝑓𝑡 is the 𝐾x1 vector of risk
factors in period 𝑡, such that 𝑡 ∈ {1, 2, ..., 𝑇 }, ⊗ is the Kronecker operator, 𝑎 is the 𝑁 x1
vector of expected pricing errors for each asset, 𝛽 is the 𝑁 x𝐾 matrix of risk related to
each asset and factors of the model, 𝛼 is the expected pricing error of the model, 𝜆 is the
Kx1 vector of risk premia for each risk factor, and 1 is a 1xN vector of ones.
    From the model’s assumptions, we know that the expected value of each line of the
matrix equals zero. The GMM method estimates the parameters (^              ^ 𝛼
                                                                         𝑎, 𝛽,     ^ by solving
                                                                               ^ , 𝜆)
the following optimization:
               {︁          }︁             𝑇                                 𝑇
                   ^ 𝛼   ^ = argmin                            ′      −1
                                         ∑︁                                ∑︁
                ^, 𝛽,
                𝑎     ^, 𝜆                      [𝑔𝑡 (𝑎, 𝛽, 𝛼, 𝜆)] 𝑊              [𝑔𝑡 (𝑎, 𝛽, 𝛼, 𝜆)]   (4)
                                {𝑎,𝛽,𝛼,𝜆} 𝑡=1                              𝑡=1

where 𝑊 is a weighting matrix of moments, which is typically set to generate as effective
estimates as possible. However, since the number of parameters and equations are the
same, the weighting matrix does not affect the estimation. Thus, we use the identity
matrix to solve the problem.
    Finally, we have the following matrix of variance and covariance parameters:

                       𝑉 𝑎𝑟(^  ^ 𝛼
                            𝑎, 𝛽,     ^ = (𝑑′ 𝑊 𝑑)−1 (𝑑′ 𝑊 𝑆𝑊 𝑑)(𝑑′ 𝑊 𝑑)−1
                                  ^ , 𝜆)                                                             (5)

where 𝑑 is the derivate of 𝑔𝑡 with respect to the parameter vector (𝑑 = 𝐸 [𝜕𝑔𝑡 /𝜕(𝑎, 𝛽, 𝛼, 𝜆)]),
𝑊 is the identity matrix ([𝑁 + 𝑁 𝐾 + 1 + 𝐾]), and 𝑆 = 𝐸(𝑔𝑡 𝑔𝑡′ ) is estimated using the
Parzen kernel with the same band as the entire value of 0.75𝑇 1/3 .


4     Risk premium analysis
4.1    Full samples analysis
    The risk premia diagnostic starts by comparing the US and the Brazilian stock market
results. The Mkt, SMB, HML, and WML risk premia are estimated using data from
January 1927 to December 2014 for the US stock market, and from January 2001 to
December 2014 for the Brazilian one.
    Table 3 presents the results, which are organized in two panels. Panel A presents
the estimated parameters for the time series regression, with the risk measures of each
portfolio. Panel B arranges the cross-section regression results, with the risk premia
estimates followed by their p-values and standard error deviations. In both panels, the
values on the left refer to the US, and on the right, to Brazil.
    The results for the time series in Panel A show some similarities between both markets.
As expected, the US market data confirm the patterns widely documented in the literature.
Most values of the intercept 𝑎 are not significant and, despite some significant cases, they do

of 𝑏 are mostly around 1.00, with low variation between portfolios, and the parameters 𝑠,
ℎ, and 𝑚 behave according to the ordering patterns reported for the portfolios returns.
In other words, the lower the value of the assets that integrate the portfolios, the higher
the estimated values of 𝑠; on the other hand, ℎ and 𝑚 grow positively correlated with
portfolios ordered by the variables Book-to-market and Momentum, respectively.
    In the Brazilian case, most of the patterns observed in the US time-series regression
repeat themselves with a few caveats. First, the estimates of 𝑎 show a lower frequency of
significant cases, which goes in favor to the model’s adjustment to the data . In addition,
the parameters’ estimates follow the same order highlighted in the results of the US
data: 𝑠 is negatively correlated with Size, and ℎ and 𝑚 are positively correlated with
Book-to-market and Momentum respectively, despite the lower frequency of significant

estimates than those observed for the US market.
    In contrast, the cross-section results in Panel B indicate some divergence between
Brazil’s and the US’ risk premia estimations. The results for the US show significant risk
premia for all factors except the market factor, which supports the capacity of the model
to fit the US data. On the other hand, the Brazilian results reject the model’s ability to
replicate the returns of assets, since only the factor WML shows a positive and significant
risk premium.
    The analysis of this result by itself could lead to the precipitated conclusion that the
multi-factor model does not fit Brazilian data. However, this result should be interpreted
with caution. Therefore, in order to identify the source of the problem, we conduct a more
careful analysis of two points that distinguish both markets: i) the size of 𝑁 , that is, the
number of assets used to build the portfolios in the estimation process, and ii) the size of
𝑇 , that is, the length of the time-series sample of the Brazilian data. The next step is to
investigate the impact of these divergences.

4.2     Does the size of N restrict the estimation?
   There is a huge difference between the number of assets available in the US and

   While the number of US assets varies, ranging from 478 to 7,123 in a history of 84
years, we observe a maximum of 137 assets over the 14-year period analyzed for Brazil.
This feature may impact on the portfolios’ behavior, since the fewer the assets used to
build a portfolio, the greater the idiosyncratic risk impact on the portfolio’s returns.
   The small number of assets could affect the risk premium estimation in two ways: i) by
generating distortion in the portfolios’ returns, which are used as dependent variables in

     The sub-periods are as follows. The first sub-period is the first period built by Center for Research
in Security Prices (CRSP) and spans from 1927 to 1962. The second sub-period begins from 1963 and
continues until the foundation of the NASDAQ in 1972. The third sub-period begins in 1972 and continues
until the starting point of the data period for Brazil, and it ends immediately after the end of the dot-com
bubble in 2000. Finally, the last sub-period ranges from 2001 to 2014 and covers the same period as the
Brazilian data.

the regressions, and ii) by impacting the estimations of the risk factors. The first concern is
discarded by analyzing the standard deviations of the returns on the 22 portfolios for both
markets, reported in Table 1. One can see that the standard deviations are quite similar
between the markets, and there is no pattern. This means that the standard deviations
of the Brazilian data are not always greater than those of the US data. This indicates
that no relevant distortions are generated in the Brazilian portfolios, which are used as
dependent variables. However, the second highlighted concern demands more attention,
considering that, as reported in Table 2, all the risk factors in the Brazilian case show
higher standard deviations than those of the US.
    The procedure to calculate the risk factors is based on building portfolios using the
correlated assets’ characteristics with the returns and then defining the returns on those
portfolios as realizations of the risk factors (Fama and French, 1993; Carhart, 1997). For
example, the factor realization SMB is obtained by calculating the return from a portfolio
long in small assets and short in big assets. However, considering the low number of
assets available in Brazil, risk factor estimation by this procedure can be affected by the
asset’s idiosyncratic risk. This could explain the pattern observed with regard to the
standard deviation of Brazilian factors in Table 2, or the results observed for the risk
premia estimations in Panel B of Table 3, in which most parameters have non-significant
estimates.
    In order to measure the impact of this feature on risk premia estimation, we decrease
the number of assets used in the estimation of the US risk factors to a similar number of
assets available for the Brazilian market and verify if the risk premia significance frequency
is affected. Therefore, we run the following procedure 1,000 times: i) for each year of the 84
years of historical data, we select a sample of 37 and 137 assets, and use them to estimate
the risk factor realization for the months of the respective year, and ii) we process the risk
premia estimation and verify if the estimated 𝜆𝑘 , such that 𝑘 ∈ {𝑚𝑘𝑡, 𝑠𝑚𝑏, ℎ𝑚𝑙, 𝑤𝑚𝑙},
are positive and significant, that is, have a t-value ≥ 1.64.
    Two methods of sample selection are applied. The first one, denominated “Random,”
is a random selection from the eligible assets of each year of the 84 years’ samples. The
second, denominated “Size x Book-to-market”, intends to preserve the distribution on the
variables Size and Book-to-market among the selected assets12 .
    The results obtained from this procedure are presented in Table 5. The first column
reports the selection method applied, the second indicates the number of assets selected
each year, and the remaining columns show the percentages from the 1,000 estimations
that return positive and significant estimates of the parameters 𝛼, 𝜆𝑚𝑘𝑡 , 𝜆𝑠𝑚𝑏 , 𝜆ℎ𝑚𝑙 , and
𝜆𝑤𝑚𝑙 . We run both selection methods with 37 and 137 assets, the two extreme cases
observed in the Brazilian data. The results using 37 assets are presented in Figure 2,
where we plot the observed density of the t-values estimated for each risk factor.
    The results show that most of the parameters are barely affected. The most affected
parameter is the SMB risk premium, which has around 85% to 92% of significant estimates
when 37 assets are used to build the risk factors, but this result changes to around 99%
when 137 assets are used. The second most affected risk premium is HML, and its biggest
impact is observed with the random selection with 37 assets; 97.8% of the estimates are
significant. WML has a very small impact and shows more than 98% significant estimates

the same outcome as when the whole set of assets is used. In other words, there is no
indication that the number of assets available for the risk premium estimation generates a
big impact in the Brazilian case.

4.3    Does the size of T restrict the estimation?
     While the US risk premia results are based on 84 years of historical data, the Brazilian
market, for which we conduct the regression, has only 14 years of data. In order to verify
whether this divergence is a constraint for Brazilian risk premia estimations, we use the
US data again as a benchmark and verify the impact of time-series length on the risk
premia estimations.
     The analysis uses the US risk factors and portfolios’ returns presented in Section 2,
and the procedure is described as follows: i) to define a time window length that has
the same number of months as the Brazilian data (168 months), ii) to estimate as many
regressions as possible on the US data using only the number of months defined in the
previous step, that is, starting with the oldest 168-month window allowed until the most
recent one, and always dropping the oldest month in exchange for a more recent one. The
results are the risk premia estimates for December 1940 to December 2014, using the data
of only the last 168 months available. At the end of this procedure, we have a total of 889
sets of estimates.
     Based on the results obtained from the described procedure, we draw Figure 3. Each
graphic in the figure is related to one parameter, 𝛼, 𝜆𝑚𝑘𝑡 , 𝜆𝑠𝑚𝑏 , 𝜆ℎ𝑚𝑙 , or 𝜆𝑤𝑚𝑙 , and each
point of each graphic indicates the t-value obtained for a particular parameter from an
estimated model with the last 168 months observed at the reference date. Therefore,
Figure 3 is nothing but a history of 889 t-values for each risk premium estimated with the
US data, using fixed windows of 168 months. In addition, each graph is accompanied by a
dotted line at value 1.64, which is the critical value adopted for rejecting the hypothesis
that the parameter is less than or equal to zero.
     The results indicate the importance of time-series sample size for the factor model
estimation and show that, even with the US data, it is not uncommon to find that risk
premia are not significant when short time-series samples are used. It is also notable
that WML is the most robust factor, just as in the Brazilian case. At the start of the
analysis of the market risk premium, we observe that, in most estimates, this parameter is
not significant, except for a few points at the beginning of the historical data. SMB risk
premium shows significance only in a few periods, mostly at the beginning of the historical
data, but we can find some significant points in the middle and in very recent periods.
The parameters relate to HML and WML, which, on the other hand, are more robust,
since their t-values exceed the critical value on many more occasions. This is especially
true for the second factor, which is significant for almost the entire history.
     After establishing the importance of time-series sample size to risk premia estimation,
we verify how sensitive the estimation is to the time-series sample size. To do so, we apply
the following procedure: i) we select several window lengths (48, 72,..., 1056 months),
ii) for each option selected in the previous step, we repeat the procedure applied to build
Figure 3 and compute the percentage that each risk premium is significant. This analysis
is presented in Figure 4. The five graphs in the figure indicate the significance of each
parameter according to the window used for the estimations. The dotted line crossing the
graphics vertically highlights the percentage obtained with windows of 14 years, the same
number available for the Brazilian data.

    The results indicate that a large time-series sample is required in order to obtain
robust estimates. We start with the parameter 𝛼, which shows positive and significant
results around 20% of the time when 14 years are used for the estimation. However, as
the time-series sample becomes larger, it becomes increasingly evident that the data do
not support the zero mean error hypothesis. The market risk premium, on the other hand,
shows robust results independent of the time-series sample length. Most results for this
parameter do not show positive and significant estimates. The results of the SMB risk
premium are very sensitive to time-series sample size. For this parameter, less than 40%
of the estimates are positive and significant even with 64 years. The other two parameters
again show themselves as more robust. Their estimations seem to be less sensitive to
window size. HML risk premium has about 20% significant estimations when 14 years are
used, and this percentage reaches 80% with 30 years. The WML factor seems to be the
most robust of all. Its results are positive and significant about 80% of the time when 14
years or more are used for the estimation.
    This section shows that the time-series sample size is a relevant restriction on Brazilian
risk premia estimation. Based on the US data, we show how common it is to estimate
non-significant risk premia when the number of observed periods is too short. Furthermore,
it seems that one should not expect robust results on factor models to which time-series

4.4    Why is the impact of T so high?
    The analysis of Brazilian risk premia shows that most of the parameters have non-
significant estimates. In addition, we show that the source of the problem is not the
small number of assets available or their characteristics, but the short historical data
of the Brazilian market. The next step is to understand why the “size of T” has such
a considerable impact and the consequences of applying a factor model to such a short
time-series sample.
    The literature on risk premiums estimated with a small T began with Shanken (1992),
followed by Jegadeesh and Noh (2013); Kim and Skoulakis (2014); Raponi et al. (2015),
and Bai and Zhou (2015). Two points emerge from an analysis of risk premium estimations
with a small time-series sample: i) small sample bias on betas, and ii) divergence between

                                                      14
ex-post and ex-ante risk premia.
    To understand these consequences, note that as presented in Equation 1, the expected
excess return from asset 𝑖 equals a linear relation between the pricing error (𝛼) and risk
compensation (𝛽𝑖′ 𝜆). However, the relation used in the risk premia estimation is
                                        ¯ 𝑖𝑒 = 𝛼* + 𝛽^′ 𝜆*
                                        𝑅                                                      (6)
                                                      𝑖

where 𝑅 ¯ 𝑖𝑒 is the average excess return from asset 𝑖, 𝛽^𝑖 is the estimated risk vector from asset
𝑖, and 𝛼* and 𝜆* are the parameters resulting from this relation. Thus, while Equation 1
has only true parameters, Equation 6 consists only of estimated values.
    The first divergence arises from using the estimated beta (𝛽^𝑖 ) instead of the true
beta (𝛽𝑖 ). According to Shanken (1992), since the independent variable in Equation 6 is
measured with error, the estimator is subject to an errors-in-variables problem, making it
biased in small samples. However, the measurement error declines as 𝑇 increases. Hence,
Shanken (1992) shows how the asymptotic standard errors are influenced by the estimation
error in the betas and proposes an adjustment for the standard errors and a bias-adjusted
estimator. Simulating studies with the US data show a bias of about −16% and −20%
when less than 172 months are used in the risk premium estimation (Raponi et al., 2015;
Bai and Zhou, 2015; Jegadeesh and Noh, 2013).
    The second divergence is caused by the use of the average excess return instead of its true
expected value. Averaging (2) over time, imposing (1), and noting that 𝐸(𝑅𝑖𝑒 ) = 𝑎𝑖 +𝛽𝑖′ 𝐸(𝑓 )
yields                                         [︁                ]︁
                                    𝑅¯ = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝜆 − 𝐸(𝑓 ) + 𝑓¯                                   (7)
                                                               .
   Equation 7 demonstrates that the relation between the true beta and the average
excess return results in the so-called ex-post risk premium, 𝜆𝑃 = 𝜆 − 𝐸(𝑓 ) + 𝑓¯, which is
equal to the sum of the ex-ante risk premium and the unexpected factor outcomes. Since
one cannot hope for 𝑓¯ to be a good estimation of 𝐸(𝑓 ) unless 𝑇 is large, as Shanken (1992)
points out, it is not possible to obtain a consistent estimate of 𝜆 when 𝑇 is fixed.
   In order to analyze the distortion that these two divergences may cause in the risk
premia estimation, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation based on the following set-up:

                                          𝑓𝑡 = 𝜆 + 𝜖𝑡                                          (8)
                                          𝑅𝑡 = 𝛽𝑓𝑡 + 𝑒𝑡                                        (9)

such that 𝑡 ∈ {1, 2, ..., 𝑇 }, 𝜖𝑡 ∼ 𝑁 (0, 𝜎 2 ), 𝑒𝑡 ∼ 𝑁 (0, Σ), and 𝜖𝑡 ⊥ 𝑒𝑡 . 𝜆 = 0.6502 and
𝜎 = 5.41, which are the mean and standard deviation respectively with regard to the US
market risk factors in Table 2. 𝛽 is the 1 × 22 vector of the market risk measure from the
US market, whose values are presented in Panel A (see the first column) of Table 3. Σ
is the 22 × 22 residual covariance matrix resulting from the US time-series regression in
Section 4.1.
    Based on this set-up, we select several values of 𝑇 , and for each of them, we simulate
10,000 draws. We then estimate the risk premium of each draw by two methods: i) the
same method presented in Section 3.2 and applied to our paper so far, and ii) a modified
estimation in which the risk premium is estimated using the true betas instead of the
estimated values. The simulation allows the analysis of several time-series sample sizes,
and we can isolate the ex-post impact using the true betas in the estimation procedure.
    Table 6 presents the results obtained for the risk premium estimation using the
estimated beta or the true beta, both for several values of T, varying from 72 to 1056
months. The first column indicates the risk measure used as the independent variable, the

    The results confirm that, as expected, the risk premium obtained with the estimated
beta is in fact biased, as demonstrated by Raponi et al. (2015); Bai and Zhou (2015);
Jegadeesh and Noh (2013). When the time-series sample has only 72 or 168 months of
data, estimates are biased by about -20% and -8% respectively , and for the estimations
with 1056 months, the bias is around 1%. In contrast, the estimation provided by the true
beta shows almost no bias regardless of the time-series sample length.
    However, the percentage of positive and significant estimates is almost the same
irrespective of the beta used. The percentage of positive and significant estimates is
between 9% and 14% for the 72-month time-series sample, about 17% to 20% for the
time-series samples of 168 months, and about 64% to 65% for 1056 months.
    These results indicate that even though the beta bias is actually a problem in small
samples, it does not appear to be a major problem, considering that the magnitude of


                                               16
the bias is small in relation to the ex-post distortion on risk premium. The difference
between the ex-post and the ex-ante risk premium lies in the unexpected factor outcomes
that have zero mean but high volatility, as the data indicate. Consequently, the ex-post
risk premium, under an estimation scenario of short time-series samples, may have a wide
range of potential values and shows large divergence from the ex-ante risk premium. Thus,
the results obtained from small time-series samples should not be used to draw conclusions
about the actual behavior of the stock market.


5     Conclusion
    Although US results are the benchmark for empirical finance literature, we show in
this paper that its risk premia estimation is not robust if it is subject the same restrictions
observed in emerging markets. In addition, the pattern of US results is the same as the
one observed in emerging markets if both are subject to same time-series sample length
constraints.
    The equity risk premia estimation on emerging market is not robust. Brazilian equity
market, for instance, among the 133 market risk premium estimates reported in the
literature, 41 are positive, 18 are negative, and the remainder are not significant. This
lack of robustness is frequently attributed to deviations from an efficient market. However,
conclusions should not be made without inspect what are the observed results with US
data if they are subject to a typical emerging market constraints: small number of assets
(small 𝑁 ) and short time-series samples (small 𝑇 ).
    To the best of our knowledge, nobody has restricted the data to understand how they
behave. By adopting such a procedure, we show that data behavior of emerging market
economies are not that awkward. By contrast, we are able to show that the US data
behavior is not robust by shortening the sample. Therefore, we analyze the sensitivity of
US risk premia estimation if restrictions are imposed on the data used.
    We conclude that the source of the problem on the emerging market estimations is not
the number of assets or their characteristics. The real problem in the estimations lies in
the fact that the available time-series sample is short. Accordingly, we investigate which
troubles the small T causes. We show that the real problem is due to the high dispersion
observed in the risk factors’ outcomes, which induces high divergence between ex-post
and ex-ante risk premia. On the other hand, we point out that the betas estimated with
time-series samples around 5 years do not generate relevant distortions in the results.
    Based on these results, it should not be stated that the problem in the robustness of
the results documented for emerging market is data deficiency per se, but in fact is the
short time interval of available data. Our analysis indicates that it is necessary to have a
time-series sample greater than 40 years in order to obtain robust results.
    Thus, the application of the factors model for risk premia estimation poses a significant
concern. Practitioners often face this problem when estimating cost of capital and usually
apply an alternative solution. While they estimate the risk measure (betas) using short
time-series sample, they use a risk premium calculated with longer time-series from
other economies, such as that of the US Damodaran (1999). The results of this paper
corroborate this alternative solution, since we show there is no relevant distortion from
the beta estimation made using short time-series samples, however, the risk premia for
those samples are not valid.
