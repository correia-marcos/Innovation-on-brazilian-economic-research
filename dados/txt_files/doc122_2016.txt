This paper proposes a stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) model with time-varying
parameters (TVP) in order to assess whether the effect of inflation uncertainty on inflation
has changed over time in Latin America. Considering inflation series for the last two
decades, we report evidences of high uncertainty from 1996 to early 2000s. Moreover,
despite being positive throughout the sample, the overall relationship between inflation
uncertainty and inflation has changed over the years in Latin America, underscoring the
importance of our time-varying specification.

Inflation uncertainty, as well as the rate of inflation, has recently drawn significant at-
tention in the macroeconomic literature. Even though understanding the interaction of
the price level and its uncertainty plays central role in successfully implementing mon-
etary policy, there remains no theoretical or empirical consensus about the nature of
this relationship. Following Friedman (1977), which informally postulated the potential
adverse effects of the inflation-inflation uncertainty nexus in real economic activity, Ball
(1992) provides a formal justification for the latter hypothesis in the context of a game-
theoretic asymmetric information setting between the monetary authority and the public,
predicting that higher inflation might potentially lead to higher inflation uncertainty in
the future. As explained by Hossain and Arwatchanakarn (2016), increasing inflation
puts pressure on the monetary authority to reduce inflation. Nonetheless, policymak-
ers may be loath to implement contractionary policy (that increase unemployment and
decrease growth). This fact increase the uncertainty in relation to the monetary policy
and consequently in relation to the price level. On the other hand, subsequent theo-
retical research advocated for causality in the opposite direction, namely from inflation
uncertainty to inflation. By employing the Barro-Gordon set-up (Barro and Gordon,
1983), Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) argue that increases in inflation uncertainty induce
a higher optimal average inflation rate as the central bank might opportunistically cre-
ate an inflation surprise in order to stimulate output growth. Alternatively, rejection of
the high inflation harmful effects on the predictability of the price level has also been in
debate. For instance, Holland (1995) stresses the existence of a stabilization motive in
high inflation periods, with the policymaker lowering inflation uncertainty as to reduce
the welfare costs of disinflationary policies, thus postulating a negative relation between
inflation and inflation uncertainty.
    Despite some early empirical research relying on cross-sectional dispersion of inflation
survey forecasts or moving standard deviations of the inflation series as measures for
inflation uncertainty (Jaffee and Kleiman, 1977; Cukierman and Wachtel, 1979; Fischer,
1981; Frohman et al., 1981; Zarnowitz and Lambros, 1987), Evans (1991) emphasizes
that uncertainty should not be taken as variability. For instance, observing ex post low
volatility does not imply low uncertainty as economic agents might still have little infor-
mation about inflation and, therefore, consider the future as highly uncertain. Moreover,
survey based measures are considered inappropriate as they only represent the dispersion
of forecasts across professional forecasters, without taking into account the individual’s
uncertainty about their own forecast (Chan, 2015). From the seminal paper of Engle
(1982), Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and generalized ARCH
(GARCH) techniques have emerged as common approaches to proxy uncertainty. How-
ever, papers based on the latter conditional heteroskedasticity models still have produced
divergent results (Brunner and Hess, 1993; Baillie et al., 1996; Caporale and McKiernan,
1997; Grier and Perry, 1998, 2000; Nas and Perry, 2000; Fountas, 2001; Kontonikas, 2004;
Berument and Dincer, 2005; Conrad and Karanasos, 2005; Thornton, 2006; Chowdhury,
2014; Payne, 2008).
    Even though ARCH-type models have been extensively employed in empirical re-
search, their deterministic framework is unable to provide information on the effects of
unanticipated uncertainty shocks on the level of inflation. By modeling the conditional
variance as an unobserved component that follows a low-order Markov process, the at-
tractiveness of Stochastic Volatility (SV) models has recently increased. As the latent


                                             2
volatility specification embodies two separate disturbance terms, it is therefore considered
more flexible than its deterministic counterpart in fitting the data (Danielsson, 1994; Kim
et al., 1998; Fleming and Kirby, 2003; Carnero et al., 2004). Nonetheless, results from
SV models concerning the interplay of inflation and inflation uncertainty are ambiguous
as well as scarce [see, e.g., Berument et al. (2009, 2011) and Chan (2015)].
    For the specific case of Latin America, empirical evidence is also rather limited. In
general, macroeconomic research has advocated in favor of the Friedman-Ball hypothe-
sis for the Latin American economies, therefore implying that their central banks have
incentives to lower inflation in order to further reduce the costs of its volatile behavior
(Daal et al., 2005). Moreover, as for the inflation-targeting countries, the implementation
of the latter monetary framework seems to have contributed to the decrease in inflation
volatility persistence (Broto, 2008). Other Latin American country-specific studies are in
line with these findings (Della Mea and Pena, 1995; Baillie et al., 1996; Ma, 1998; Vale,
2005; Grier and Grier, 2006; Castilho et al., 2007; Thornton, 2008).
    However, this paper proposes to go beyond the earlier work for Latin America. As
empirical research for the Latin America has struggled so far to provide results evalu-
ating whether the relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty has changed
over time, this paper aims to shed some light on this matter. According to Lucas (1976),
the structure of an econometric model is based upon the optimal decision rules of eco-
nomic agents, thus shifts in policy regime might influence the estimated coefficients of
behavioral equations. For instance, Evans and Wachtel (1993) stress that disregarding
regimes changes in the inflation process might underestimate its level of uncertainty. Our
econometric strategy is based on a Time-Varying Parameter Stochastic Volatility in Mean
(TVP-SVM) model in which the stochastic volatility effects on the level of inflation are
both direct and time-varying, following closely Chan (2015). To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first attempt to apply this class of models to assess how uncertainty
affects inflation over time in the region. We focus on five Latin American economies –
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay – for which monthly inflation data
span from January 1996 to February 2015.
    Overall, the obtained results show that inflation uncertainty is relative higher until
early 2000s. Moreover, as for the relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty,
we document a time-varying positive interplay in Latin America. Also, there are evidences
of the considered Latin American countries being able to mitigate the adverse shocks from
the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the time-
varying parameter stochastic volatility in mean (TVP-SVM) model, highlighting how
it can be applied to the unobserved components approach model of Stock and Watson
(2007). We also describe the data set used in this paper. Estimation results are summa-
rized in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 concludes.

    2.1   Stochastic Volatility in Mean (SVM) Model with Time-Varying
                                  Parameters (TVP)
In order to evaluate whether the effects of inflation uncertainty on inflation have changed
over time, we adopt a stochastic volatility in mean model with time-varying parameters
(TVP-SVM) proposed by Chan (2015). The model structure is given by:


                                             3
                              0
                       yt = xt β t + αt eht + εyt ,                    εyt ∼ N (0, eht ),               (2.1)
                      ht = µ + φ(ht−1 − µ) + εht ,                     εht ∼ N (0, σ 2 ),               (2.2)
                      γ t = γ t−1 + εγt ,                              εγt ∼ N (0, Ω),                  (2.3)

where yt is the time series of interest, xt is a k×1 vector of covariates, β t is a k×1 vector of
time-varying parameters, Ω is a (k + 1) × (k + 1) covariance matrix and the disturbance
terms εyt and εht are considered mutually and serially uncorrelated. The conditional
variance function is specified in logarithmic form in which ht follows a stationary AR(1)
process with |φ| < 1, being initialized with h1 ∼ N (µ, σ 2 /(1 − φ2 )). The vector of
                           0 0
coefficients γ t = (αt , β t ) in (2.3) evolves as a first-order random walk process, being
initialized with γ 1 ∼ N (γ 0 , Ω0 ) for constant matrices γ 0 and Ω0 . One should notice
that this random walk specification increases model flexibility as it allows us to capture
both temporary and permanent shifts, thus considered a more suitable framework for
describing changes in private sector behavior or the learning dynamics of both private
agents and policymakers (Primiceri, 2005).
    Since equations (2.1)–(2.3) define a nonlinear Gaussian state-space model, the tradi-
tional Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches cannot provide reliable estimates for the
parameters due to intractability of the likelihood function. Moreover, even though the
Bayesian approach of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using Kalman filter-based
algorithms is considered standard in dealing with this class of models, Chan (2015) ar-
gues that the TVP-SVM approach cannot be easily dealt by the latter methods as the
likelihood evaluation would involve “integrating out” both types of states (namely, γ t
and ht ), creating an even more complex and high-dimensional nontrivial problem. From
the recent advances in band and sparse matrix algorithms, Chan (2015) proposes an effi-
cient MCMC sampling approach that can simulate each type of states individually as it
exploits the fact that the Hessian of the log-conditional density of the log-volatilities is a
band matrix containing only a few nonzero elements arranged along a diagonal band.
                                                       0         0             0  0                          0
    Let x denote the covariates, y = (y1 , . . . , yT ) , γ = (γ 1 , . . . , γ T ) and h = (h1 , . . . , hT ) .
The posterior drawing process can be described by sequentially sampling from1 :

   1.    p(h|y, x, γ, µ, φ, σ 2 , Ω) = p(h|y, x, γ, µ, φ, σ 2 );
   2.    p(γ|y, x, h, µ, φ, σ 2 , Ω) = p(γ|y, x, h, Ω);
   3.    p(Ω, σ 2 |y, x, γ, h, µ, φ) = p(Ω|γ)p(σ 2 |h, µ, φ);
   4.    p(µ, φ|y, x, γ, h, σ 2 , Ω) = p(µ, φ|h, σ 2 ).

   Finally, regarding the choice of priors, this paper assumes independent priors for σ 2 ,
µ, φ and Ω, following Chan (2015):

                              µ ∼ N (µ0 , Vµ ), φ ∼ N (φ0 , Vφ )1(|φ| < 1),
                                                                                                        (2.4)
                                σ 2 ∼ IG(νσ2 , Sσ2 ), Ω ∼ IW(νΩ , SΩ ),
where IG and IW denote the inverse-gamma distribution and the inverse-Wishart dis-
tribution, respectively. Additionally, the stationary condition |φ| < 1 is imposed on the
prior for φ.

 2.2    Decomposing Inflation: An Unobserved Components (UC) Approach
In order to decompose inflation into a trend and a transitory component, Chan (2015)
embodies the TVP-SVM framework to the unobserved components model of Stock and
Watson (2007). Despite the variance of the trend being constant, this version assumes
that the transitory component has stochastic volatility as well as a volatility feedback
mechanism in which the level of inflation might be affected by its own volatility. Further-
more, the specification also encompasses past inflation effects (but not contemporaneous
effect) on the current inflation volatility. Thus, future inflation can be affected by volatil-
ity - inflation uncertainty. That is, the model structure is given as:


               πt = τt + αt eht + επt ,                           επt ∼ N (0, eht ),        (2.5)
              ht = µ + φ(ht−1 − µ) + βπt−1 +        εht ,          εht            2
                                                                         ∼ N (0, σ ),       (2.6)
              γ t = γ t−1 + εγt ,                                  εγt   ∼ N (0, Ω),        (2.7)
                                      0
where π is inflation, γ t = (αt , τt ) and Ω is a 2 × 2 covariance matrix. The coefficient
αt measures the impact of the transitory volatility – exp(ht ) – on the level of inflation.
As past inflation πt−1 is a covariate in the conditional variance equation, its associated
parameter β enters the MCMC algorithm as an extra block, sampling it from its full
                                                                                           0
conditional distribution: (β|y, h, µ, φ, σ 2 ) ∼ N (β̂, Dβ ), where Dβ−1 = Vβ−1 + X β X β /σ 2
                            0                                         0
and β̂ = Dβ (Vβ−1 β0 + X β z β /σ 2 ) with X β = (y1 , . . . , yT −1 ) and z β = (h2 − φh1 − µ(1 −
                                   0
φ), . . . , hT − φhT −1 − µ(1 − φ)) .
    Following equation (2.4), independent priors are assumed for equations (2.5)–(2.7).
As for the hyper-parameters, µ has a Gaussian distribution with mean µ0 = 0 and
variance Vµ = 10, φ follows a truncated Gaussian distribution with φ0 = 0.97 and variance
Vφ = 0.12 , and β has a normal prior N (β0 , Vβ ) with β0 = 0 and Vβ = 10. In regard to
the variance parameters, νσ2 = νΩ = 10, S = 0.36 and SΩ = diag(0.13, 0.8125), so that
Eσ 2 = 0.22 and EΩ = diag(0.12 , 0.252 ). Besides being considered rather noninformative,
Chan (2015) underscores that these chosen priors are in accordance with the desired
smoothness of the corresponding state transition.

                                   2.3    Data Description
The data set consists of seasonally adjusted2 monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) infla-
tion, computed as πt = 1200×ln(CP It /CP It−1 ), for five Latin American economies,
namely Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay. The period spans from
1996:M1 to 2015:M2, which gives T = 230 for each country. The time series were down-
loaded from the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina (INDEC), the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the National Administrative De-
partment of Statistics of Colombia (DANE), the Bank of Mexico (BANXICO) and the
National Institute of Statistics of Uruguay (INE).
    Table 2.1 reports the descriptive statistics, unit root tests and ARCH-LM tests for
inflation rate in Latin America. From the table, the following observations can be made:
(i) due to high excess kurtosis, inflation rate tends to have a leptokurtic distribution with
values concentrated around the mean which seems to justify the use of a time changing
  2
    In order to perform the seasonal adjustment of the data set, we applied the X-12-ARIMA method
developed by U.S. Census Bureau.

volatility model. The ARCH-LM test confirms this result; (ii) the distribution also seems
to be biased to the right; (iii) the region displays high inflation variability given that the
standard deviation is nearly equal (or superior, in the case of Argentina) to the mean; and
(iv) both the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests rejected
the null hypothesis of a unit root at the 1% significance level3 .

    Figure 2.1 presents the Latin America monthly CPI inflation for the 1996:M1–2015:M2
period. In general, these time series show contrasting patterns, which can be seen as a
first indication that a time-varying framework might be the suitable choice for modeling
inflation. For instance, Brazil has clearly undergone a more volatile behavior from 1996
to 2002 whereas Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay have shown a downward trend during
the same period.

                                     3    Estimation Results

As mentioned before, we estimate a time-varying parameter stochastic volatility in mean
(TVP-SVM) model to assess the potential time-variation in the effects of inflation un-
certainty on the level of inflation for Latin America. In order to compute the posterior
estimates for each country, we draw 50,000 samples after the initial 5,000 samples were
discarded in the burn-in period. We use the conditional variance estimates as the measure
of inflation uncertainty.
    In the particular case of Argentina, Figure 3.1 shows a substantial increase in log-
volatility estimates from 1998 to 2002, reflecting the rather unstable Argentine macroeco-
nomic configuration that later led to the default on public debt and a significant business
cycle contraction. After abandoning the peso-dollar parity in January 2002, inflation
uncertainty in Argentina entered a downward trend period until late-2007. Even though
volatility slightly peaks in 2010, our results suggest that the recent U.S. Financial Crisis
had a short-lived and mild impact on the country economic performance. As for the sharp

    Regarding the unit root tests for Colombia, the ADF test rejected the null hypothesis at the 10%
significance level.

increase after 2012, this behavior might be mostly attributed to a demand-led macroeco-
nomic strategy and the lack of an anti-inflationary commitment in face of the increasing
fiscal deficits and the rapid-paced exchange rate appreciation.
    Regarding the inflation uncertainty impacts on the level of inflation, the αt estimates
display an overall steady upward trend which indicates that the responsiveness of Argen-
tine inflation to uncertainty shocks has increased over the last two decades. In addition,
these results strongly support the existence of a positive relationship between the latter
variables, particularly after 2000. However, when considering the 90% credible intervals,
the parameter is apparently different from zero only after 2010. This time-variation in
αt thus corroborates the use of our TVP-SVM approach.
    The results for Brazil are presented in Figure 3.2. Even though the inflation-targeting
(IT) regime was adopted in June 1999, one could say that the regime consolidation was
only achieved after 2003 given the previous Brazilian Central Bank inability to maintain
the level of inflation near its target. The increased volatility observed in 2002/2003 cor-
responds to ’"Lula effect"’ (political uncertainty during the pre-election period in Brazil).
From 2003 until 2006, the conditional variance estimates had a substantial decrease, be-
coming less volatile and reflecting the gains of credibility associated to the IT regime.
Furthermore, despite the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis leading to an slight
increase in uncertainty, its effects were not as severe as in other emerging countries.
    As for assessing the effects of uncertainty on inflation, the estimates of αt for Brazil
are rather time-invariant. However, the coefficient is statistically different from zero
throughout the whole sample. Given its positive sign, one can therefore infer that periods
with high inflation uncertainty are accompanied by periods of high inflation in Brazil.
    The results for Colombia are qualitatively similar to the ones for Brazil (Figure 3.3).

    The estimates of αt for Colombia follow the same overall time-invariant pattern of
Brazil. Although, one should note that the impact of uncertainty on inflation in Colombia
had an initial decrease from 1996 to 1999. Therefore, this might constitute an evidence
that the use of a crawling band for exchange rate and an intermediate monetary target
were effective in partly offsetting the transmission mechanism of inflation uncertainty on
inflation.
    In contrast, the aftermath of the Tequila Crisis in December 1994 led to serious
macroeconomic instability in Mexico. For instance, from 1996 to 2002, the posterior
estimates of the log-volatility show considerable erratic movements despite ht being higher
in the beginning of the sample (Figure 3.4). After officially adopting the IT regime in
2001, uncertainty entered a more stable period. Moreover, our results indicate that the
2008 Financial Crisis was responsible for increasing inflation uncertainty until late-2009.
    Our TVP-SVM specification is also capable of capturing a significant drop in αt
estimates from 1996 to 2001. Hence, there are evidences for the soothing effect of the
financial assistance of the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund (e.g., the Mexican
Debt Disclosure Act of 1995) on the inflation-inflation uncertainty dynamics. Concerning
the rest of the sample period, αt estimates seem to be time-invariant. However, when
considering the 90% credible intervals, the latter estimates are only statistically different
from zero from 1996 until late-1999.
    Figure 3.5 plot the evolution of the inflation uncertainty (ht ) and its time-varying
impact (αt ) for Uruguay. The results for ht are in line with those ones from Argentina,
especially until 2006. The sharp increase in uncertainty, peaking in mid-2002, exposes the
fragility of Uruguay’s economy to the external adverse shocks from the Argentine Finan-
cial Crisis. However, de la Plaza and Sirtaine (2005) argue that, despite the occurrence of
2002 Uruguayan banking crisis being intrinsically correlated to Argentina’s financial sys-
tem collapse, some inherent weaknesses of the Uruguayan economy and banking sector

    We estimate two alternative models in order to compare the performance of TVP-
SVM model: the unobserved components model (UC) and the SVM model with constant
parameter (UC-SVM-constant). The first model was proposed by Stock and Watson
(2007) and it is the standard unobserved components model with stochastic volatility. In
this model, we set αt = 0 for t = 1, ...,T. In the second model, we set α1 = ... = αT = α.
Thus, the effect of uncertainty on inflation does not change over time. The models were
compared using marginal likelihood, calculated by the method of Chib and Jeliazkov

    The TVP-SVM model is the most appropriate for all countries but Brazil. This is
not surprising, since the αt is approximately constant over the period, as can be seen in
Figure 3.2.
    The broad conclusions from the obtained results are that Latin America has presented
a high volatile inflation behavior over the sample period, implying the existence of con-
siderable uncertainty in the region. Moreover, when dealing with the inflation-inflation
uncertainty dynamics, the countries considered (with exception of Brazil) have shown
time-varying estimates. For Colombia, although the impact of inflation uncertainty on
inflation is apparently time-invariant, the TVP-SVM model was more appropriate than
time invariant models (see Table 3.1). In the Brazil, we analyzed the post-Real Plan
period, which achieved the stabilization of the economy and significant decrease in the
inflation rate. This fact improved economic predictability, which may help explain the
time-invariant result. However, it is important to note that the relationship between
inflation and inflation uncertainty in Brazil is significantly different from zero, which
highlights the relevance of volatility in determining inflation in the period. This result
confirms the analysis contained in Broto (2008), which found no evidence that the in-
troduction of inflation targeting regime in Brazil is associated with lower inflation. For
the other countries analyzed in Broto (2008), including Colombia and Mexico, there are
evidences that the introduction of inflation targeting regime is associated with a decrease
in the inflation level, which may help explain the difference between the results. The
results obtained by Chan (2015) for USA, UK and Germany in the period from 1955Q1
to 2013Q4 show significant time variation in the parameter which measures how inflation
volatility affects the level of inflation. Moreover, Chan (2015) concludes that inflation
uncertainty effect on inflation in Germany is less important compared to the USA and
UK.
    As for policy recommendation, the overall positive link between inflation and inflation
uncertainty in Latin America consequently leads to incentives for the policymaker to
decrease uncertainty in order to effectively reduce the welfare costs of inflation. This
can be obtained through a predictable and credible monetary policy. High transparency
and clear communication may be reduce the uncertainty inflation and consequently the
inflation.

                                    4   Conclusions

In this paper, we have proposed a time-varying parameter stochastic volatility in mean
(TVP-SVM) model in order to evaluate the the effects of inflation uncertainty on infla-
tion in Latin America over the 1996:M1-2015:M2 period. By allowing for time-varying
parameters, our specification is thus less susceptible to the Lucas (1976) critique.

    The obtained results indicate that the TVP-SVM is indeed capable of capturing the
structural instability of the inflation series. However, in the case of Brazil, the inflation-
inflation uncertainty interplay is rather time-invariant. Moreover, there are evidences of
a greater volatile inflation behavior in the beginning of the sample period in comparison
to the last few years. Overall, the considered Latin American economies seem to have
endured relatively well the external adverse shocks from the 2008 Global Financial Cri-
sis. Moreover, these results have important implications for monetary policy since both
inflation and inflation uncertainty may adversely affect the real economic variables and
make the price mechanism less efficient. Even, these results confirm the conclusion in
Broto (2008), which shows that the inflation targeting regime has been useful to reduce
the inflation.
    As for further research, we intend to apply our TVP-SVM specification to a mul-
tivariate framework to also evaluate, for instance, the time-varying effects of inflation
uncertainty on economic activity in Latin America. Rahman and Serletis (2008) uses the
multivariate GARCH-M model to analyze this issue to USA, UK, Japan and Canada .
Another interesting point is to analyse the transmission mechanism of external shocks
(US inflation, for example) to inflation uncertainty in Latin America. Some studies have
addressed this issue, as Hossain and Arwatchanakarn (2016) for Thailand and Buth et al.
(2015) for the case of Cambodia,Lao PDR, and Vietnam. Furthermore, it would be in-
teresting to evaluate the degree of inflation uncertainty co-movements in Latin America
in order to assess the fragility of these economies to the behavior of their respective
neighboring countries.
