    Os preços dos imóveis no Brasil apresentaram um crescimento surpreendente nos últimos
    anos. Uma questão importante é tentar entender quais elementos podem explicar este com-
    portamento. Este artigo investiga a hipótese de que um otimismo generalizado, associado
    com políticas governamentais direcionadas ao setor de habitação, podem estar por trás do
    comportamento dos preços dos imóveis. Este artigo desenvolve um modelo Dinâmico Es-
    tocástico de Equilíbrio Geral para investigar essas questões. Os resultados mostraram que
    os subsídios combinados com a flexibilização das condições de crédito foram capazes de
    influenciar positivamente os preços dos imóveis. Além disso, os choques não antecipados
    tiveram maior impacto nos preços das habitações que os choques antecipados.

    Housing prices in Brazil have shown a surprising growth in recent years. An important is-
    sue is trying to understand what elements can explain this behavior. This article investigates
    the hypothesis that a generalized optimism associated with government policies directed to
    the housing sector may be behind the behavior of real estate prices. This article develops
    a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model to investigate these issues. The results
    showed that subsidies combined with the easing of credit conditions were able to positively
    influence real estate prices. In addition, unanticipated shocks had a greater impact on hous-
    ing prices than anticipated shocks.

1    Introduction
    The period following 2003 was marked by a boom in commodity prices, and Brazil was one
of the countries that have benefited from this cycle. However, the subprime crisis contributed
to the reversal of this cycle in 2009, causing the Brazilian government to adopt expansionary
policies in order to stimulate internal aggregate demand aiming to offset the negative effects of
the global crisis. Within this context, public policies aimed specifically at the real estate sector
emerged in Brazil.
    In 2007, the Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC) was implemented with public
investments focused on logistics, energy, social and urban infrastructure. The Minha Casa,
Minha Vida (MCMV) program, launched in 2009, was an integral part of PAC, with an initial
goal of building one million homes, with investment of R$ 60 billion, of which R$ 28 billion in
subsidies.
    In addition to the housing program aimed at the acquisition of real estate by low income
individuals, there were a number of public works directed to the adequacy of host cities of the
World Cup in the years before 2014 and the Olympic Games, carried out in 2016 (in Rio de
Janeiro). Besides these events, giant oil discoveries (pré-sal or pre-salt) in Brazil also helped to
create optimistic expectations regarding the Brazilian economy. This period coincides with a
steep increase in housing prices leading some economic commentators to associate the housing
boom to this wave of "good news", optimistic behavior and expansionist fiscal policy in Brazil.
    The optimistic perspectives regarding the Brazilian economy were evidenced by the British
magazine "The Economist", in which:
          "(...) China may be leading the world economy out of recession but Brazil is also on a
     roll. It did not avoid the downturn, but was among the last in and the first out. Its economy
     is growing again at an annualised rate of 5%. It should pick up more speed over the next few
     years as big new deep-sea oilfields come on stream, and as Asian countries still hunger for
     food and minerals from Brazil’s vast and bountiful land. Forecasts vary, but sometime in the
     decade after 2014 - rather sooner than Goldman Sachs envisaged - Brazil is likely to become
     the world’s fifth-largest economy, overtaking Britain and France. " (Prideaux, 2009).
    The news shocks approach has been extensively explored in the context of DSGE and VAR
models. This hypothesis was proposed originally by Pigou (1927) and revisited by authors
such as Beaudry e Portier (2006), Jaimovich e Rebelo (2009), Barsky e Sims (2011), Milani e
Treadwell (2012), Schmitt-Grohé e Uribe (2012), Khan e Tsoukalas (2012), Kilian e Hicks (2013)
with the intention of showing the importance of news shocks as a relevant source of aggregate
fluctuations.
    However, as highlighted by Mendicino et al. (2015), there are few studies aimed at analyzing
the effects of news shocks on the housing market and the implied spillovers to the rest of the
economy. Given the forward-looking nature of housing prices, news about future economic
conditions would presumably be reflected in the determination of such a variable.
    Based on this, we develop a DSGE model to analyze the relationship between economic
agents’ expectations about future economic developments, also known in the literature as "news
shocks", expansionary fiscal policy and housing prices in Brazil. Besides the changing in fiscal
policy, in 2010, there were changes to the housing financing rules with reductions in Loan-
to-Value (LTV) and income needed to finance real estate. Altogether these events - optimistic
behavior by economic agents, expansionary fiscal policy and credit deepening in the housing
sector - might offer an explanation to the steep increase in housing prices in Brazil.

    Our results show that both price subsidies and subsidized interest rates exerted a positive
influence on housing prices in Brazil. In response to a housing demand shock, housing prices
display a greater increase the greater are the subsidies to low income families. We also show
that anticipated shocks have a larger impact on housing prices than unexpected shocks. There-
fore, our results support the idea that the wave of good news, optimistic behavior and gov-
ernment policies aimed at the housing sector were behind the behavior of housing prices in
Brazil.
    There are some studies applied to the Brazilian economy that mention some of these stimuli.
We highlight the studies proposed by Mendonça et al. (2011), Mendonça (2013), Silva et al.
(2014) e Besarria et al. (2016). In general, the authors show that there is a negative relationship
between monetary policy instruments and real estate prices. This paper differs from these
authors by taking into account the effects of government subsidies, subsidized interest rates
and anticipated shocks from a DSGE model, explicitly addressing their effects on housing prices
in Brazil.
    In addition to this introduction, the article presents four other sections. In the next, we
present the DSGE model, followed by the methodological discussion. In the fourth section, we
show the results. Finally, in the last section, we discuss some final considerations.


2    News shocks and Brazilian housing market
    Expectations about future economic conditions are one of the key ingredients in the eco-
nomic agents’ decision-making process. Agents are forward-looking and hence changing in
belief about future economic results may generate excessively optimistic or pessimistic expec-
tations about the future and this impact their current behavior.
    In the housing sector could not be different. The behavior of housing prices today, for in-
stance, reflect not only current economic conditions, but also expectations about the future.
Based on this discussion, the literature has attempted to investigate how and to what extent the
housing market responds to news about future economic fundamentals.
    Among the studies that associated changes in the real estate market with expectations about
future economic fundamentals or news shocks, we highlight: Lambertini et al. (2013a), Ng e
Feng (2016), Lambertini et al. (2017) and Abildgren et al. (2018).
    Lambertini et al. (2013b) use a vector-autoregression (VAR) model and data from the Uni-
versity of Michigan Survey of Consumers and provide evidence on the importance of news and
consumersâ beliefs for housing-market dynamics and aggregate fluctuations. The VAR model
was estimated using U.S. quarterly data over the sample period 1965:Q1-2009:Q4. The results
show that unexplained changes in News on Business Conditions have statistically significant
implications for the future path of private consumption, inflation, house prices and the federal
funds rate. In short, this study was limited to empirical analysis.
    Subsequently, the literature sought to introduce elements that could reflect more faithfully
the way the news shocks influence the housing market through a dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium (DSGE) models. Iacoviello (2005) and Iacoviello e Neri (2010) used the DSGE mod-
els to address the causes and consequences of fluctuations in the US real estate market. These
studies were limited to analyzing the effects of unanticipated shocks on housing demand and
housing technology on US real estate price changes and housing investment. In addition to
pioneering discussion, these articles are the basis of recent studies that address the role of news
shocks.

                                                3
    Lambertini et al. (2017) included in the model proposed by Iacoviello e Neri (2010) one
rule of news shocks and find that expectations of a future increase in housing demand lead
to a housing price boom but fail to generate co-movement between business investment and
all other aggregate variables. In addition, only expectations of future expansionary monetary
policy that are not met, both regarding the policy rate and the central banks inflation target,
are likely to cause a boom-bust cycle and a macroeconomic recession. Thus, a high degree of
transparency in monetary policy reduces uncertainty about future monetary policy actions and
thereby the occurrence of cycles.
    In addition, the authors investigated the role of credit conditions as a source of housing
market fluctuations. Survey data suggests that current favorable credit conditions as well as
expected future tighter credit conditions are important reasons for consumers to judge house
buying conditions as good. These suggest what a current unanticipated increase in the access to
credit raises on impact house prices and all other macroeconomic variables but fails to generate
hump-shaped dynamics.
    Although the recent literature has reported the importance of including news shocks to ex-
plain the behavior of the real estate market, there are still no studies applied to the Brazilian
economy that include this component. Recently, Besarria et al. (2018) explored the significance
of overoptimism for house prices in Brazil using a theoretical model that establish that, in the
absence of a bubble, a long-run equilibrium relationship should be observed between the mar-
ket price of an asset and its dividends. The authors implement two methodologies. First, the
authors assess whether there is a cointegration relationship between housing prices and hous-
ing rental prices. Second, the authors test whether the price-to-rent ratio is stationary.
    Results show that there is evidence of a bubble in housing prices in Brazil. However, given
the short span of the data, the authors perform a Monte Carlo simulation and show that the
cointegration tests may be biased in small samples. Therefore, the results should be analyzed
with caution. This study represents an attempt to to capture the sentiment of economic agents
regarding the future behavior of real estate prices. However, the model proposed by the authors
is unable to capture the real estate market response to news.
    The initial challenge of this article is to show that there is an association between feelings not
based on fundamentals or news and the behavior of housing prices. To illustrate this possible
relationship will be used data on consumer expectations and real housing prices in Brazil. There
is a vast literature reported that aggregate consumer confidence indices reflect sentiments view
on confidence shocks1 . This transmission channel is due to the fact that consumption represents
63% of GDP and an optimistic or pessimistic expectation regarding this indicator may anticipate
the future results of the spending, investment decisions and aggregate product.

                Figure 1: Real house prices and consumer expectations in Brazil

    Figure 1 shows the development in consumer expectation and house prices in Brazil since
the second quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2018. The real housing price is from the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) and consumer expectation data are from Instituto de Pesquisa
Econômica Aplicada - IPEA. As noted by Abildgren et al. (2018) in the case of Denmark, there
seems to be a strong correlation between consumer expectations and real housing prices in
Brazil. This reflects that both house prices and consumer confidence respond to business cycle
factors. Additionally, we will model the exogenous sentimental shocks that contribute to the
movements in house prices.


3     Model
    The economy is made up of families, entrepreneurs, final goods firms, a financial sector and
a fiscal authority. Families are divided into two groups: patients or savers and impatient or
debtors. They differ in terms of their intertemporal discount factors. Both provide labor for
firms producing non-durable goods. Impatient families are restricted in the amount of borrow-
ing they can take.
    The production side of economy model is given by the consumer goods production sector.
The financial sector is composed of a representative bank that pays the deposits made by patient
families and channels resources for the granting of housing loans, with the accumulation of
assets subject to regulatory restrictions.


3.1   Patients families
   This economy is populated by two types of households, a fraction Ω, where 0 < Ω < 1, is
formed by impatient households and the remaining fraction is formed by patient households.
Impatient households discount the future more heavily than patients households. Both house-
holds receive utility when consuming goods (ct ), housing stock (ht ) and leisure. In addition,
both agents provide work services to the production sector.

    In this scenario, patients families are the creditors and the impatient debtors. Due to the
presence of financial frictions, borrowers face a credit constraint in relation to the amount of
financing that can be acquired in each period, using housing stock as collateral.
    The problem of optimization faced by patient and inpatient families are similar, they both
seek to maximize a lifetime utility function:

where φc is the habit persistence coefficient; τ q is a government subsidy. In the period t, the
impatient family makes a loan (bt ), which is indexed to the interest rate Rtb . Differently from
patient households, the government subsidizes housing of impatient families. This feature is to
capture the effects of "Minha Casa, Minha Vida", a federal government program that subsidize
housing acquisition for low income families, in our model, impatient households.
   Impatient households face a collateral constraint, given by:

                                              b                        00

    The expression (13) shows that the debt service cannot exceed a fraction mh ∈ [0, 1] of the
expected value of the housing asset, given as collateral. The term mh or LTV allows the model
to accommodate the recent increase in household indebtedness in Brazil. Although real estate
mortgage rates for low-priced real estate in Brazil are not associated with leverage or collateral
of borrowers, banks respect the minimum LTV indices to meet the demand for home loans.
For this reason, a collateral restriction was imposed on this credit segment, as proposed by
Carvalho et al. (2014).
    The solution to the problem of impatient families is given by:

3.3   Bankers
   As is Iacoviello (2015) there is a representative banker that solves the following problem:

where ct depicts the representative banker’s, φb is the habit persistence coefficient; dt denotes
deposits made by patient families; bt are loans made by impatient families and τ b is the tax rate
on consumption.
    Iacoviello (2015) stresses that the restriction of the banker’s cash flow (21) implicitly assumes
that deposits can be freely converted into loans. Thus, to make the discussion more realistic,
we assume that the bank is limited in the ability to issue liabilities by the value of equity (as-
sets less liabilities) in its portfolio. This restriction may be motivated by problems of limited
commitment or regulatory concerns.
    Denoting kb,t = bt − dt as the bank’s capital at the beginning of the period, thus, the capital
adequacy constraint can be reinterpreted as a standard loan constraint, described by:

                                                                    dt = γbt                          (22)
    In the expression (22) the left side denotes the bank liabilities, while the right side denotes
the fraction of bank assets that can be used as collateral, where γ is the capital adequacy con-
straint.
    The first order conditions are represented by:

3.4   Firms
   There is firms that produce consumption goods and housing using two technologies. Firms
operate under perfect competition, with flexible prices and produce non-durable goods, Yt . To
produce non-durable goods, firms use the labor provided by both types of households and
capital as inputs. The production technology is given by:
                                                          0       00
                                    Yt = At (kt )µ [(Lt )α(1−µ) (Lt )(1−α)(1−µ) ]             (28)
where α represents the participation of the workforce from the patient families; µ represents the
share of capital in the production function; At is the productivity shock for the consumer goods
sector. Productivity shocks and preferences are defined as:

                                            ln(At ) = ρc ln(At−1 ) + vt                       (29)
with ρc being the autoregressive coefficient; vt follows a process AR(1) (innovations with zero
mean, uncorrelated and with standard deviation σA ).
    The housing sector produces output with labor and capital public and private. The produc-
tion technology is:
                                                                  0           00

where ν represents the participation of the capital; kg,t represents public capital; Φ represents
the share of workforce from the patient families in the production function; ω represents the
participation of the private capital; Ah,t is the productivity shock for the housing sector. Based
on Cavalcanti et al. (2018), we assume capital may be public or private, with public capital
being exogenously determined by the government. Public capital, which is made available at
zero cost to all firms, is assumed to be productivity-enhancing.


3.5   Fiscal authority
   The fiscal authority finances its expenditures through taxation on consumption, wages and
capital rents. For simplicity we assume that the government does not emit money or issue
bonds, and subsidizes the purchase of housing by low income households by transferring re-
sources. Thus, government revenue is represented by:

where Bt follows an autoregressive process; τ q qt (ht − ht−1 ) are subsidy spending.
   The primary surplus (SPt ) is given by the difference between the total revenue and the total
expenditure of the government during the same period:

decides to subsidize the real estate financing rate, causing the interest rate of the loan to be
represented by:

3.7    News shocks
   As in Christiano et al. (2010), we assume that the shock error term consists of an unexpected
component (t ) and an anticipated component (t−n )

                                                     vt = t + t−n                                                     (38)

where t is a white noise process. Thus, at time t, agents receive a signal on future macroe-
conomic conditions that will occur in time t + n. If the expected motion does not occur, then
t = −t−n and vt = 0. It is assumed that the news shock is anticipated two periods in advance,
that is, n = 2. In addition, it will include anticipated shocks in productivity of non-durable
consumer goods sector (At ) and preference for real estate.
    In addition, we have included four exogenous shocks: a housing preference, j,t ; a public
capital shock, k,t ; a loan-at-value shock, ltv,t and a risk credit (Basel) shock, rc,t . It is assumed

4     Econometric Methodology

4.1   Data
   For the estimation of the DSGE model, we employ quarterly series of GDP obtained from
the IBGE (quarterly national accounts), housing financing, collected at the Brazilian Chamber
of Construction Industry (CBIC) and real estate prices obtained at the Central Bank of Brazil
(BCB), covering the period from April 2001 to March 2018.


4.2   Estimation
    Table 2 presents the mean values, standard deviations and values corresponding to the
lower and upper limits of the 90% Highest Posterior Density interval of the estimated parame-
ters, using the Bayesian inference technique. Some parameters are fixed during the estimation
process. The fixed parameters are from Iacoviello (2015) and are standard in the literature. Table
1 presents a description of the parameters that were kept fixed. The parameter of subsidy was
established based on the ratio between the government subsidy and the ceiling for the value of
the property.

   The parameters were obtained from two independent sequences with each one being com-
posed of 800.000 withdrawals using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Mean acceptance along
the two chains was 27%, and convergence was assessed using the methods proposed by Brooks
e Gelman (1998). The first 400.000 withdrawals were discarded to ensure independence from
the initial conditions. The statistics of interest were then calculated on the basis of the joint
distribution of posterior ergodic probability of the structural parameters.

5     Results
5.1   Unanticipated shocks
    Figure 2 presents the theoretical functions of response to the productivity shock in the non-
durable goods sector. Positive technological shocks in the consumer goods sector promote an
increase in investment, consumption and income. As a result of the expansion in income there
is an increase in the demand for real estate, causing real estate prices to increase.
    The increase in house prices relaxes the collateral constraints of impatient individuals, lead-
ing to an expansion in household indebtedness. Thus, in response to the increase in demand
for loans, the bank resets the loan rate to a value above its steady state value.

5.2   The role of news shocks
    In this section we focus our discussion on the response of our model to news shocks. The
mechanism of transmission of the considered news shock is the following: Initially (time zero)
the economy is in the steady state. At time one, unanticipated news arrives. Agents learn that
there will be 1 percent permanent increase in At beginning one periods later, in period two.
In other words, economic agents receive positive news about future income growth. Figure 3
illustrates the effects of a positive news shock to productivity.

    This news shock causes housing prices and income to increase. This component makes
impatient agents have greater access to credit, reinforcing an increase in current spending on
housing and consumption. Due to higher demand for housing, current real estate prices also
increase. In addition, due to credit limits, impatient families increase their labor supply to
raise internal funds for housing investments. On the other hand, companies adjust the stock of
capital at the moment the news comes. The stock of capital used as a production input in the
consumer goods sector increases over time, thereby increasing the current investment. These
effects were also observed in (Lambertini et al., 2013b; Ng e Feng, 2016).


5.3   Additional shocks
    For completeness, we also consider other alternative shocks (housing preference, loan-to-
value, public capital and capital adequacy). The top row of Figure 4 reports the impulse re-
sponse of house prices to a positive innovation to housing preference and loan-to-value; the
bottom row reports the impulse response to a shock to public capital and capital adequacy.
    The housing preference shock is defined as an exogenous stochastic disturbance at the
marginal rate of substitution between consumption goods and housing in the utility function
of patient and impatient families. Given that housing supply is fixed, this shock is also known
in the literature as a housing demand shock.
    It is possible to perceive that the increase in the demand for real estate promotes an expan-
sion in housing prices. In addition, as pointed out by Iacoviello e Neri (2010), this shock also
eases the collateral restriction of impatient agents, allowing them to increase their indebtedness
and consumption. Since impatient agents have a large marginal propensity to consume, then
the effects of the preference shock on total consumption are positive, even if the consumption
of creditors (not represented) decreases. It should be noted that, as occurred in the productivity
shock, the increase in the demand for loans causes the bank to readjust the financing rate to
values above the steady state.

Figure 4: Effects of the shocks housing preference, loan-to-value, public capital and capital

    The effects of two financial shocks will also be described. The first is represented by imposed
restrictions on the Loan-to-Value (LTV). This indicator is treated in the literature as a macropru-
dential policy measure that aims to control credit and an possible instability in the banking
sector. In treating this indicator as an exogenous shock it is possible to perceive that our results
reinforce the argument that the increase in households’ indebtedness capacity stimulates the
increase in housing demand, housing prices and consumption. On the other hand, the expan-
sion in house prices, also used as collateral, reduces the possibility of default on bank loans and
encourages banks to carry out a larger number of loans to households. This expansion in credit
results in higher household indebtedness and an expansion in housing prices.
    The second financial shock is represented by the increase (the higher γ) the utility cost of
reducing loans. Intuitively, γ functions as a multiplier of the loans and magnification of this
indicator implies that for each R$ 1.00 deposited, the lower the amount of loans made. In this
case, the effects are contrary to those described by the credit expansion via the LTV shock.
    In this case, as described in Iacoviello (2015), the increase in this indicator causes the banker
to consume more today, reducing the availability of loans. By lending less, the bank tightens its
borrowing constraint, since it reduces its equity. The result of this process is a reduction in the
consumption of impatient families and the demand for housing and housing prices.


5.4   The impact of housing subsidies
    Housing subsidies in Brazil are provided through programs such as MCMV and interest
rate policies subsidized that reduce the cost of real estate credit in relation to market financing

                                                                            15
costs. The subsidies for the acquisition of real estate by low-income individuals, adopted as a
housing policy in Brazil, can be considered as one of the mechanisms that helped explain the
increase in housing prices. In Brazil, the weight of the MCMV program, totaling government
expenditures, was approximately 1,7%, representing 0,2% of GDP in 2015. In addition, in the
period from 2011 to 2015 there was a real increase of 40% a.a. in capital expenditures of the
MCMV program, according to data from the Ministry of Finance.
    The subsidies, through the MCMV program, are related to the income brackets of individu-
als. According to the current rules, there are four income bands for financing, which are: Range
1: for families with monthly income of up to R$ 1.8 thousand; Range 1.5: monthly income limit
of R$ 2.600; Range 2: monthly income limit of R$ 4 thousand and; Range 3: Monthly income
limit of R$ 9 thousand. The subsidies on the purchase value of the property are differentiated
between the bands. For Range 1, for example, the subsidy amount can reach 90% and these
values change between the bands.
    In the case discussed in this article, the hypothesis to be considered is that in the short term
the supply of real estate is fixed and the subsidy to demand promotes an increase in real estate
prices. Based on that, two scenarios will be considered: the first will admit an average real
estate subsidy rate of 20% (this being the rate considered in previous years) and the second will
assume that the government does not subsidize the purchase of real estate.
    These scenarios will be used to verify if the adoption of a housing subsidy policy has poten-
tiated the effects of the aggregate shocks (produtivity, news, housing preference, loan-to-value,
public capital and capital adequacy) on the behavior of real estate prices in Brazil.

prices. As can be seen, only the combination of the government subsidy rate and the LTV
shock brought different effects to the behavior of real estate prices. This is a result that is not
surprising for the Brazilian economy.
   In addition to the implementation of the policy of subsidies for the purchase of real estate,
in 2010 there was a reduction in costs and expansion of access to housing finance, with, for
example, maximum LTV passing from 70% to 80%. This mechanism can be seen as another
explanation for the rapid growth of real estate prices in Brazil, suggesting that adjustments
inthe subsidy rate with easing credit conditions may influence the price cycle.

    The combination of unanticipated, anticipated news and LTV gives the largest contribution
to the deposits of patient families. Thereafter, the housing prices in Brazil is explained by the
combination of shocks unanticipated (above 51%) and anticipated news (about 49%). A similiar
finding was also reported by Fujiwara et al. (2011) and Ng e Feng (2016).


6     Conclusion
    In this paper we study the sources of fluctuations in housing prices in the Brazilian economy,
using a DSGE model. We focus on assessing the effects of subsidies and news shocks and
unanticipated shocks on the cyclical behavior of housing prices.
    The results show that productivity (anticipated and unanticipated) shocks and preferences
for real estate positively affect the demand for real estate, promoting the expansion of housing
prices. As a result of this expansion in prices, there is a relaxation in the collateral restrictions of
impatient agents, allowing to increase their indebtedness and consumption. Therefore, our re-
sults support the idea that the wave of good news, optimistic behavior and government policies
aimed at the housing sector were behind the behavior of housing prices in Brazil.
