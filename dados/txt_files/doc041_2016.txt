                                         Abstract

 Since the early 1990s several countries have adopted inflation targeting (IT). However,
IT may not be sufficient to ensure fiscal discipline, and governments can still pursue
irresponsible fiscal policies under IT. As a consequence, the adoption of irresponsible
policies which lead to a weak fiscal credibility could undermine the credibility of the
central bank. In this study, we argue that fiscal discipline is a key aspect for IT and for
central bank credibility. This study contributes with the literature since it provides
empirical evidence for the determinants of both fiscal credibility and central bank
credibility. Moreover, the study presents evidence for the influence of fiscal credibility
on central bank credibility. The empirical analysis is based on different econometric
techniques (OLS, GMM and TOBIT). The findings suggest fiscal credibility is important
to build central bank credibility. In other words, when agents form expectations that
public debt is under control, these expectations end up influencing inflation expectations.

A partir da década de 1990, vários países adotaram o regime de metas de inflação (RMI).
Entretanto RMI pode não ser suficiente para garantir a disciplina fiscal, e governos podem
continuar implementando políticas fiscais irresponsáveis sob RMI. Como consequência,
a adoção de políticas irresponsáveis, que leva a uma fraca credibilidade fiscal, pode
enfraquecer a credibilidade do banco central. Neste estudo argumentamos que a disciplina
fiscal é um aspecto chave para o RMI e para a credibilidade do banco central. Este
trabalho contribui com a literatura pois fornece evidências empíricas sobre os
determinantes de ambas a credibilidade fiscal e a credibilidade do banco central.
Ademais, o estudo apresenta evidências da influência da credibilidade fiscal sobre a
credibilidade do banco central. A análise empírica é realizada com diferentes métodos
econométricos (OLS, GMM e TOBIT). Os resultados sugerem que a credibilidade fiscal
é importante para construir a credibilidade do banco central. Ou seja, quando os agentes
forma expectativas que a dívida pública está sob controle, essas expectativas influenciam
as expectativas de inflação.

1. Introduction

       According to Blinder (2000, p. 1421), credibility matters in theory, and it is
certainly believed to matter in practice. In his study, he asks: Why is credibility so
important to central bankers? And how can a central bank create or enhance credibility?
       Regarding central bank credibility, Blinder (2000) presents the following definition,
which is in accordance with Kydland and Prescott’s (1977) argument: a central bank is
credible if people believe it will do what it says. Based on this definition, an inflation
targeting central bank has credibility when people believe on the announced inflation
target; and, credibility is earned when the convergence of inflation expectations for the
inflation target occurs (Agénor and Taylor, 1992; Svensson, 2000). Based on the idea that
series of expected inflation could be applied to derive a credibility index, existing
measures of central bank credibility refer to a gap between inflation expectations of
economic agents and the central bank inflation target (e.g., Svensson, 2000; de
Mendonça, 2007).
       Earning credibility, however, is not a trivial task in emerging economies,
particularly, in those countries that lived for several years with high inflation rates, and
thus, have been presenting a history of low credibility. Since the early 1990s an increasing
number of emerging and developed economies have started implementing inflation
targeting as the framework to guide monetary policy. However, according to Mishkin
(2007), inflation targeting may not be sufficient to ensure fiscal discipline, and
governments can still pursue irresponsible fiscal policies with an inflation targeting
regime in place. As a consequence, the adoption of irresponsible fiscal policies which
lead to a weak fiscal credibility could undermine the credibility of the central bank.
       In this study, based on the arguments presented in the seminal work of Sargent and
Wallace (1981), we go further and argue that fiscal discipline and absence of fiscal
dominance are key aspects for inflation targeting and for central bank credibility. Thus,
if both fiscal policies and public debt management are important for inflation targeters,
how do we build fiscal credibility? Does fiscal credibility affect central bank credibility?
       This study contributes with the literature since it provides empirical evidence for
the determinants of both fiscal credibility and central bank credibility. Moreover, the
study presents evidence for the influence of fiscal credibility on central bank credibility.
As far as we know, there are no studies for the determinants of fiscal credibility as well
as for the relationship between fiscal credibility and central bank credibility. The
empirical analysis is based on different econometric techniques (OLS, GMM and
TOBIT), and considers the period from December 2001 to February 2016 for the
Brazilian economy.

2. The importance of credibility

      In the 2006 speech to the Annual Washington Policy Conference, the President and
CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Janet Yellen, argued that, “credibility
is not only virtuous; it is also useful. I will argue that one of its most important benefits
is shaping public expectations about inflation, and in particular, ‘anchoring’ those
expectations to price stability. As a consequence, credibility enhances the effectiveness of
monetary policy” (Yellen, 2006).
      A credible monetary policy implies less effort by the central bank for the
achievement of the inflation target (de Mendonça and de Guimarães and Souza, 2012;
Montes and Bastos, 2014). Empirical evidence suggests that a high credibility is
associated with a lower volatility of the interest rate for the achievement of the inflation
target (de Mendonça and de Guimarães and Souza, 2012). This alignment of the central
bank’s actions and the public’s expectations strengthens monetary policy effectiveness.
       Inflation targeting works as a guide for inflation expectations and it is associated
with an increase in central bank transparency, which, in turn, increases accountability in
the implementation of monetary policy and thus improves credibility (de Mendonça and
de Guimarães and Souza, 2012). However, the fulfillment of the inflation target is the
main factor to influence inflation expectations.
       The inflation targeting regime has played a key role in macroeconomic stabilization
in several developed and developing countries since the beginning of the 1990s (Walsh,
2009). Inflation targeting in emerging market economies has been a more challenging
task than in developed economies due to several vulnerabilities and to low levels of
credibility (Minella et al., 2003). In fact, one basic task of emerging market central banks
has been to build credibility. This requires actions consistent with the inflation targeting
framework (such as commitment with price stability, coordination between fiscal and
monetary policies as well as fiscal and financial stability) combined with high levels of
transparency and communication with the public (Montes, 2010).
       The success of the inflation targeting regime relates, to a large extent, with the
earning of credibility. Credibility in this context means that private agents believe that the
central bank will act consistently within the inflation targeting framework (Minella et al.,
2003), but also the government will act committed with sound fiscal policies. In this
sense, the gain of credibility takes time and it depends on both fiscal and monetary
policies. Thus, what is the importance of fiscal sustainability and fiscal credibility for
inflation targeting emerging countries? Why fiscal sustainability so important, and how
does it influence fiscal credibility?

2.1 Importance of debt management and fiscal sustainability to fiscal credibility

       According to Sargent and Wallace (1981), fiscal sustainability has an unequivocal
impact on price stability and, thus, it represents an important condition to help monetary
policy keeping inflation low and stable. As Shirakawa (2012) stresses, when the
government loses its credibility with respect to the sustainability of government debt and
does not make enough effort to regain it, this ultimately leads to a higher inflation or a
default on the debt (or both). Hence, fiscal sustainability itself is an essential precondition
for the proper functioning of a central bank (Shirakawa, 2012), and thus, fiscal credibility
represents an essential precondition to build central bank credibility.
       Regarding the relation between fiscal sustainability and price stability, high levels
of government debt can lead to difficulties in controlling inflation. Sargent and Wallace
(1981) consider the situation of a government running deficits, which are financed by
issuing government bonds. If these deficits are unsustainable, in that government will not
be able to finance deficits indefinitely through issuing bonds, then eventually the
outstanding debt will need to be financed by an increased level of currency, and hence
could lead to higher inflation in the future. Sargent and Wallace (1981) also stress that a
large public debt implies a difficulty for reducing the interest rate. Moreover, if demand
for money depends on expected inflation, then unsustainable deficits could lead to higher
inflation in the present period. These arguments present an important relation between
fiscal and monetary policy and it justifies fiscal sustainability from the perspective of
inflation targeting.
       Fiscal stability is a basic necessary condition for inflation control and for inflation
targeting. An important lesson from Sargent and Wallace (1981) is that irresponsible
fiscal policy puts pressure on the monetary authorities to monetize the debt, thereby
producing rapid money growth and high inflation. If fiscal imbalances are large enough,
monetary policy eventually becomes subservient to fiscal considerations (“fiscal
dominance”) and an inflation target would have to be abandoned or modified. Thus, fiscal
reforms, which help keep budget deficits from spinning out of control are needed to
prevent the fiscal imbalances that can lead to a collapse of an inflation targeting regime
(Mishkin, 2008).
       One typical problem of emerging economies that have adopted inflation targeting
is that a disinflationary monetary policy can cause a fiscal imbalance. The reason is that
the basic interest rate is the main monetary policy instrument. But, in countries such as
Brazil, public debt is strongly indexed to the interest rate. Therefore, increases in interest
rate to reach the inflation target imply increases in the primary surplus required for
stabilizing the public debt/GDP ratio.
       The fiscal stability can be achieved by a policy based on a tight fiscal policy
(increase in taxes or decrease in government spending) as a way of generating primary
surpluses. Another possibility for achieving fiscal stability, such as pointed out by
Giavazzi and Missale (2004), is the low cost government funding. Therefore, public debt
management can be an important tool for reducing fiscal vulnerability.

3. Empirical analysis

       In 1999, Brazil adopted inflation targeting. Since then, central bank credibility is
fundamentally explained by central bank’s commitment with inflation control. However,
since fiscal policy and public debt management also exert influence on inflation, and
aiming coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, the government launched in
1999, the “Fiscal Stability Program” (FSP). This program had the intention to strengthen
fiscal discipline, reduce the public deficit and stabilize the debt/GDP ratio. The program
introduced targets for the primary surplus, set limits on indebtedness and increased fiscal
transparency.
       In terms of public debt management, at the end of 1999, in an attempt to improve
the composition of government liabilities, efforts were made to increase the share of
fixed-rate and price-indexed securities and to reduce the share of floating rate and
exchange rate-indexed debt. Besides, the Brazilian Treasury announced a strategy for
extending the maturity of federal securities (de Mendonça and Vivian 2008).1 The
Brazilian Government adopted this strategy in order to improve credibility,based on
models of public debt management (Calvo and Guidotti, 1990; Giavazzi and Pagano,
1990; Barro, 2003; Missale, Giavazzi, and Benigno, 2002; Giavazzi and Missale, 2004).
       Thus, it is important to verify if the measures in terms of the public debt
management adopted in Brazil have helped to build fiscal credibility. Furthermore, it is
important to analyze the determinants of central bank credibility under inflation targeting.

3.1 Data

        The period under analysis runs from December 2001 to February 2016, containing
171 monthly observations. The database begins in this period due to availability of the
data regarding expectations. The series used in this study are presented as follow.
      The central bank index (CBCI) is based on the idea of Agénor and Taylor (1992)
that series of expected inflation could be applied to derive a credibility index. As
Svensson (2000) proposed, the credibility can be measured by the difference between

  See de Mendonça and Machado (2013), Gomes, Pires and Terra (2014) and de Mendonça and Pessanha
(2014) for more details regarding public debt management in Brazil.
expected inflation and the target. In this sense, the credibility index is the index proposed
by de Mendonça (2007). The central bank credibility index has a value equal to 1 when
the annual expected inflation (𝐸[𝜋]) is equal to the target (𝜋 𝑇 ) and decreases in a linear
way while inflationary expectation deviates from the announced target. Therefore, the
credibility index shows a value between 0 and 1 strictly if the expected inflation is situated
between the maximum and minimum limits (𝜋 ∗ ) established for each year and assumes a
value equal to zero when the expected inflation exceeds one of these limits. The index
uses the series of inflation expectations of professional forecasters obtained from the
Central Bank of Brazil (CBB), the inflation target defined by the monetary authority and
the tolerance bands. Hence,

        Moreover, central bankers take time to increase or to decrease its credibility. In this
sense, we work with the smoothed series (trend) obtained from the Hoddrik-Prescott
filter. Figure 1 shows the graph of the index and its trend.

       To define what drives central bank credibility we follow Blinder (2000). The history
of honesty is an important aspect to build credibility. In this sense, the success in keeping
inflation under control is an important factor. We check this effect through the inflation
deviation from the target (INFD)2, expecting a rise in the INFD to reduce central bank
credibility. Moreover, to fight against inflation is also important to build credibility.


2
 This series is constructed by the deviation of the inflation rate accumulated in a year (IPCA “Consumer
Price Index” – series 13522 obtained from the CBB) from the inflation target.
When central bank rises the basic interest rate (IR)3, it represents efforts to control
inflation, and then is expected to increase credibility.
        Due to the fact Brazil is an emerging economy, external factors are relevant to the
conduct of monetary policy. The pass-through effect from exchange rate to inflation
suggests exchange rate variation can affect credibility (de Mendonça and Tostes, 2015;
Minella et al. 2003). Hence, we also check the influence of the variation in the exchange
rate (ER)4.
        The main goal of this paper it to show the relation between fiscal credibility and
central bank credibility. The fiscal credibility index (FCI)5 is calculated based on the
indicator proposed by de Mendonça and Machado (2013). Since credibility represents the
belief by the public in the probability of a successful execution of the policy (Drazen,
2000), and taking into account IMF’s recommendation and Maastricht limits to public
debt, the fiscal credibility index seeks to capture government’s commitment to public debt
sustainability and, thus, the public’s expectations regarding fiscal solvency. The
benchmarks assumed in the fiscal credibility index are in line with the IMF’s (2002)
calculations. Thus, the lower limit is a public debt to GDP ratio of 40% (debtMin) because
it is a long-term target that should not be breached by emerging economies. The upper
limit is a public debt to GDP ratio of 60% (debtMax) because this debt to GDP ratio target
is part of the Maastricht treaty, and thus it is a useful reference for developed countries.
Since credibility is a forward-looking variable, the credibility index takes into account
the information (monthly frequency) available by the CBB on market expectations
regarding public debt to GDP ratio.
        Therefore, based on these benchmarks, the credibility index considers the following
possibilities: (i) market’s expectations on the public debt for the next 12 months are lower
than the lower limit (40%) - in this case the risk of fiscal imbalance is null and thus the
credibility index is 1 (full credibility); (ii) market’s expectations for the next 12 months
are greater than the upper limit (60%) - in this case there exists a high probability that a
fiscal imbalance occurs and thus the credibility index is 0 (null credibility); and (iii)
market’s expectations for the next 12 months are between the above‐mentioned limits -
in this case the risk of fiscal imbalance is decreasing as it approaches the lower limit and
it is increasing as it approaches the upper limit, thus the range of the credibility index is
from 0 to 1 (strictly) (de Mendonça and Machado, 2013). It is expected a positive relation
between FCI and CBCI. The credibility index is a result of:

      In the same way of the central bank credibility index, we apply the Hodrick-
Prescott filter to obtain the trend of the series.

        To explain the behavior of the fiscal credibility we choose a group of variables
important to the sustainability of the fiscal policy. Fiscal credibility is undermined if
public debt presents an unsustainable path. Giavazzi and Missale (2004) argue that the
main goal of public debt management in Brazil is the stabilization of the debt/GDP ratio
(DEBT).6. Thus, we expect a negative relationship between DEBT and FCI. The
indexation composition and the maturity of the public debt are also important to fiscal
credibility. The average maturity of the public debt (AMD)7 is connected to the
refinancing risk. A more extended period of maturity is one of the factors that reduces the
amount of bonds that need to be rolled over in a period of crisis (Giavazzi and Pagano,
1990). The series is used following the ideas of Giavazzi and Pagano (1990), Calvo and
Guidotti (1990) and Missale, Giavazzi and Benigno (2002), thus, it is expected a positive
relation between AMD and FCI.
        In relation to the indexation of the public debt, we create an index to simplify the
interpretation. We follow the idea of Giavazzi and Missale (2004) that most of the
Brazilian public debt should consist of fixed-rate bonds and price indexed bonds, and that
the proportion of exchange-rate indexed bonds and interest-rate indexed bonds should be
reduced in order to improve the composition of public debt and, thus, the efficiency in
the management of public debt. Hence, increases in fixed rate bonds (FIX_B) and
inflation-linked bonds (INF_B) represent improvements in public debt profile, whereas
increases in bonds indexed to the interest rate (INT_B) and indexed to the BRL/dollar
exchange rate (EX_B) indicate a deterioration of the public debt profile. The index is a
result of the difference between these parts. Therefore, the index is calculated as:

        The interpretation of the INDEX8 is straightforward. When the INDEX is
positive, it denotes a good quality of the indexation profile. On the other hand, when the
INDEX is negative, it represents a bad quality in the public debt profile. The expected
relation between INDEX and FCI is positive. Figure 3 shows in the second semester of
2006 the INDEX became positive and there is a trend toward improvement

        A first condition to be analyzed, before applying the estimations, is to check if
series have unit root. Therefore, the following tests Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF),
Phillips-Perron (PP) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) were made (Table
A.1, Appendix). Based on the tests, one can observe that all series are stationary.
        The empirical analysis is conducted in two stages (as shown in Figure 2): first, the
determinants of fiscal credibility (FCI) are estimated, and then the determinants of central
bank credibility (CBCI) are estimated.

3.2 Methodology and preliminary analysis

       We estimate the relationships expressed in Figure 4 using ordinary least squares
(OLS), generalized method of moments (GMM), TOBIT and GMM system. One reason
for using GMM is due to endogeneity problems. Besides, this method provides consistent
estimators for the regressions (Hansen, 1982). As pointed out by Wooldridge (2001, p.
95), “to obtain a more efficient estimator than two-stage least squares (or ordinary least
squares), one must have overriding restrictions.” The weighting matrix in the equation
was chosen to enable the GMM estimates to be robust, considering the possible presence
of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown form.
       Overidentification analysis has an important role in the selection of instrumental
variables to improve the efficiency of the estimators (Cragg, 1983). We performed a
standard J-test with the objective of testing this property for the validity of the
overidentifying restrictions (Hansen, 1982). The chosen instruments were dated to the
period t−1 or earlier to help predict the contemporaneous variables, which are unavailable
at time t (Johnston, 1984). We also present the Durbin–Wu–Hausman test of the
endogeneity of regressors (Durbin, 1954; Wu, 1973; Hausman, 1978).
       Furthermore, we use the TOBIT method (Tobin, 1958), which is an adequate
method because the credibility indexes are continuous variables that assume different
values between 0 and 1. It is worth noting that the values of the dependent variable (MCI
and FCI) are not concentrated in censored values. In fact, as one can see through Figure
1, the values for MCI are not concentrated at all, and the Figure 2 shows FCI concentrate
less than 30% of the observations. The TOBIT model uses all of the information,
including information about the censoring data, and provides consistent estimates of the
parameters (Long, 1997).9
       The lags of the variables were determined in an empirical basis following the
general-to-specific method. This methodology takes into consideration not only the
statistical significance of the parameters, but also diagnostic tests, in order to ensure that
the chosen model has explanatory power and thus to guarantee a parsimonious equation
(Hendry, 2001).
       Moreover, to assure the relation we propose in this work is in the correct direction,
we present in Table 1 the Granger Causality Test to the two main variables of this
analysis, CBCI and FCI. To perform this test we choose the lag of the Granger Causality
Teste we follow three information criterions (Akaike, Schwarz and Hannan-Quinn),
presented in the table A.2 in the appendix. The results of the Granger Causality Test
indicate the CBCI does not cause FCI, but the FCI is able to influence the CBCI. This
results suggests we choose the right direction in our analysis.

Regarding OLS estimates, due to the problems of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, the reported t-
statistics in the OLS estimates are based on the estimator of Newey and West (1987).
      Table 2 shows the results to equation 4 estimations. The reported t-statistics in the
OLS estimates are based on the estimator of Newey and West (1987), which is consistent
in the presence of both heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown form. In the
GMM10 estimation, the J-statistic indicates that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
instruments selection is apposite. The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test indicate the regressors
are exogenous.
      The results present the expected signal to all variables. The negative signal for
DEBT shows that higher debt/GDP ratio reduce fiscal authority credibility. Thus,
difficulties in stabilizing the debt/GDP ratio generate loss of fiscal credibility. The DEBT
coefficients present statistical significance in GMM and TOBIT estimates. The AMD
and INDEX variables present positive influence over FCI. Increases in the average
maturity helps to reduce the risk of refinancing the public debt and then improve fiscal
credibility. The result for the indexation profile implies fiscal authority can benefit of a
good quality of indexation. When the INDEX increases, it also increases the fiscal
credibility. Moreover, the basic interest rate (IR) presents negative signal in the results.
When central bank rises the basic interest rate, it increases the cost of the public debt,
reducing the fiscal credibility.
      In this sense, the evidence shows that the measures adopted by the National
Treasury regarding the composition of public debt and lengthening the period of maturity
of public debt contributed to increase fiscal credibility. Thus, the findings corroborate the
arguments and recommendations of Calvo and Guidotti (1990), Giavazzi and Pagano
(1990) and Giavazzi and Missale (2004).

3.4 Estimations related to monetary policy credibility

     Aiming to explain what drives monetary policy credibility as well as to verify
whether fiscal credibility is important for central bank credibility, we estimate equation 5
below:

(5) CBCIt  1   2 INFD  3 IR   4 D _ ER  5 FCI  t

       Table 3 presents the estimates. The reported t-statistics in the OLS estimates are
based on the estimator of Newey and West (1987). The results do not present problems
of specification. In terms of GMM11 estimation, the J-statistic indicates that we cannot
reject the hypothesis that the instrument selection is correctly specified. The Durbin-Wu-
Hausman test indicate the regressors are exogenous.
       The results presents expected signals according to the literature. The positive signal
for IR and the negative signal for INFD corroborate the idea of Blinder (2000) that the
history of honesty and the act of fighting against inflation are important to build
credibility. The inflation deviation has negative influence over central bank credibility.
When the inflation deviates from the target it represents lacks of commitment of the
central bank with the monetary policy goals and then reduce central bank credibility. In
turn, the results indicate that an increase in the basic interest rate (IR) signals the
commitment of the central bank to keep inflation under control and thus increases central
bank credibility. Thus, to rise the interest rates is to fight against inflation and its helps
central bankers to be credible. The D_ER variable also presents a negative relation with

Regarding OLS estimates, due to the problems of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, the reported t-
statistics in the OLS estimates are based on the estimator of Newey and West (1987).

      The FCI presents positive signal to all methods. This positive signal implies fiscal
credibility can help to build central bank credibility. Fiscal credibility is related with the
capacity of the fiscal authority to honor its debts providing public debt sustainability.
Thus, the positive signals indicate when the fiscal authority is committed to a sound fiscal
policy it helps to increase the central bank credibility. This result reinforces the argument
of King (1995) that fiscal discipline enhances monetary policy credibility. This result also
puts light in the fiscal dominance theory. If the fiscal authority increases it debts and
deteriorate the confidence public has on the public debt sustainability, it will reduce the
central bank credibility.
      Thus, the results indicate that when there is a commitment of the monetary authority
and government with their goals, an increase in central bank credibility is verified.

3.5 Systems of simultaneous equations

        Based on evidence found in the estimations above, fiscal discipline and the
policies adopted by the National Treasury in terms of public debt management are
important to increase fiscal credibility. In turn, fiscal credibility and the commitment of
the monetary authority with price stability are important to enhance central bank
credibility. In this sense, the conduct of economic policies and the behavior of
policymakers are important for macroeconomic stability and, thus, to build both fiscal
credibility and central bank credibility.
        A way of testing the validity of the equations and coefficients previously achieved
is through system of equations. For treating possible problems of endogeneity, the use of
system of equations which applies GMM is adequate for estimating non-biased
coefficients. Thus, in order to give robustness for the results presented in the previous
sections, one systems of equations are estimated12 with equation (4) and (5):

                  FCI _Tt  1   2 DEBTt   3 AMDt   4 INDEX t   5 IRt   t
        System  
                  MCI _Tt  1   2 INFD  3 IR   4 D _ ER  5 FCI  t

        The results presented in table 4 corroborate the previous findings. All coefficients
present the same signal and statistical significance. The J-test indicate the instruments
respect the orthogonality restriction. Hence, the evidences provided by the GMM system
provide robustness to previous results.
        Regarding the estimates presented in Table 4, all coefficients presented the
expected signs and statistical significance. The estimates show the importance of public
debt management and government commitment with fiscal targets for building fiscal
credibility. In other words, the improvement in the composition of public debt, a more
extended period of maturity of public debt and the commitment with the fiscal targets
contributed to the increase of fiscal credibility. Regarding the determinants of central
bank credibility, the findings corroborate those already found and, in particular, the
estimates of the systems reveal, as well as in the individual estimates, the influence of
fiscal credibility on central bank credibility.

4. Conclusion

      Since the adoption of inflation targeting by several developed and developing
countries, and the recognition that credibility matters not only in theory but also, in
especially, in practice, academics and policymakers share a common concern: how to
build credibility.

      This study investigates the determinants of both fiscal credibility and central bank
credibility in Brazil. The findings suggest that since 2002, the National Treasury has
promoted improvements in public debt management that were important to build fiscal
credibility: the improvement in the indexation profile and the lengthening of the country’s
average debt maturity. The analysis showed the commitment with an appropriate debt
management and responsible fiscal policies are important to build fiscal credibility.
      Regarding central bank credibility, the analysis showed that inflation deviations
from the target and currency devaluations have a negative effect on central bank
credibility. In turn, increases in the basic interest rate show the public the commitment of
the central bank with a specified inflation.
      Moreover, a relevant finding obtained through the empirical analysis is the
influence of fiscal credibility on central bank credibility, i.e., fiscal credibility is important
to build central bank credibility. In other words, when agents form expectations that
public debt is under control, these expectations end up influencing inflation expectations.
