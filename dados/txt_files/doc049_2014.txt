     The existing empirical literature on political budget cycles (PBCs) has generally ignored the
 effects of term limitations on fiscal opportunism. In this paper, we explore the different electoral
 incentives faced by first term mayors who are eligible for reelection and second term mayors
 who are legally banned to stand for another term in office. Our results point to significant fiscal
 differences between both types of mayors in Brazil. During elections, first term mayors decrease
 revenues from own local taxation and change their budget composition by moving from current
 expenditures towards capital related ones, while budget balances and total expenditures remain
 unchanged. These findings are consistent with recently developed signalling models of PBC
 and with the conditional political budget cycles literature, where incumbents aiming at maxi-
 mizing their reelection chances subject to institutional restrictions on fiscal deficits change the
 composition of the budget in electoral years by providing more visible and targeted expenditures.

1     Introduction
Since Nordhaus (1975) launched his model of political business cycle - in which an incumbent politi-
cian seeking reelection would behave opportunistically by promoting expansionary economic policies
prior to elections - a large body of empirical work testing his theory has been produced over the last
30 years. Among the many political motivations driving political business cycles, perhaps the main
one is the ambition of reelection (of a politician or party). Therefore, the legal and real possibility of
an incumbent politician or party to be reelected is a necessary condition for the emergence of political
business cycles. However, not all incumbents are eligible to run for reelection, and indeed, not all
seek reelection. Most of the literature ignores this fact. This omission is critical, since incumbents
who are not eligible for reelection should not, a priori, engage in opportunistic fiscal policy as a
strategy to increase their reelection chances. As prescribed by Rogoff (1990) in his classical model
of rational political budget cycles (PBCs), “The prospect of being able to run for reelection again
in the future raises the temptation to distort fiscal policy, and thus tends to exacerbate the political
budget cycle.”(Rogoff (1990), p. 30).
    How, then, do the fiscal strategies of politicians who are eligible for reelection differ from those
who cannot stand for a subsequent mandate as elections draw close? In other words, does the
possibility of reelection affect fiscal policy? If the theoretical predictions of opportunistic fiscal cycles
are correct, one should expect more loose fiscal policies in the last years of a mandate (i.e. election
years) for the group of first term politicians (who are eligible for reelection) than for the group of last
term politicians (who are legally impeded from running for reelection). Surely, the assumption that
first term incumbents are more inclined to behave opportunistically compared to those at their last
term could be false if one considers that even last term incumbents still have incentives to behave
opportunistically, for example, if they seek to secure the reelection of their parties or bolster their own
political career once their permitted term expires. Moreover, it could be that last term incumbents
would be inclined to generate higher deficits whenever transferring office to a political opponent,
leaving an unfavourable fiscal environment for the following government.
    The above arguments are very plausible and show how difficult it might be to empirically deter-
mine the driving forces behind fiscal opportunism. Those arguments suggest that what to expect
empirically may not be clear-cut because of the different factors that potentially influence the be-
haviour of incumbents. Yet, if both first term and last term incumbents face - to a greater or lesser
extent - electoral incentives to manipulate fiscal outcomes, it is reasonable to assume that observable
differences in their fiscal behaviour, after one has adequately controlled for other relevant factors,
may be explained by their different reelection conditions. In this sense, we posit that identifying
incumbents as first or last term office holders is both feasible and meaningful for an appropriate
empirical analysis of the opportunistic-type PBC.
    The main purpose of this paper is to estimate the effect of term limitations on the fiscal strategies
employed by Brazilian local governments, especially during election periods. Based on fiscal and
electoral data of 3,393 Brazilian municipalities between 2001 and 2008, this paper provides evidence
in support of the proposition that significant differences exist between the fiscal strategies employed
by first term and second term mayors during elections. As elections draw near, first term mayors
reduce local tax revenues and adjust their budget composition by moving from current towards
capital-related expenditures. Interestingly, they do so without detriment to the budget balance. The
findings of this paper are consistent with recently developed signalling models of PBC and with the
conditional political budget cycles literature: in Brazil, first term mayors and reelection runners,
while facing incentives to behave opportunistically, are at the same time subject to institutional
restrictions on fiscal policy. As a consequence, mayors running for reelection change the composition
of the budget in electoral years by increasing the types of expenditures which are more visible and
presumably more appealing to voters (i.e. investments) while keeping a controlled fiscal balance.
This regard for fiscal balance signals levels of competence or policy preferences to rational and

heterogeneous voters who may (or may not) be averse to higher spending in general, but have a
preference for targeted expenditures (Drazen & Eslava (2010)).
    Brazil is an interesting case study to test the opportunistic fiscal cycle at the local level for a
number of reasons. First, Brazil has over 5,500 municipalities and almost 140 million voters, making it
one of the biggest and most politically decentralized federalist countries in the world. Additionally,
municipalities constitute the smaller electoral district in Brazil, being the main geographical unit
where votes are cast in local, state and national elections - in this sense, much of the political
game is played at the municipal level. Thirdly, municipalities are subject to a number of common
constitutional rules, being comparable in a broad range of institutional features. Finally, using the
terminology developed in the recent literature on political cycles (e.g. Brender & Drazen (2005); Shi
& Svensson (2006)), Brazil can be classified as a young developing democracy. Following 20 years
of military dictatorship (1964-1984), Brazilian voters have been getting adapted to the electoral
process over the recent past, which should have reduced the scope for fiscal manipulations during
elections. In fact, the Brazilian economy has recently undergone important institutional changes
affecting electoral and fiscal policies, with potentially relevant impacts on political cycles. As the
recent conditional political budget cycles literature suggests, the presence and magnitude of electoral
fiscal cycles are conditioned on certain institutional, political and economic contexts (e.g. De Haan
& Klomp (2013a)).
    The paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a brief literature review on political
business cycles and term limitations, with a particular focus on fiscal policy. In section III, we
present the Brazilian institutional setting, followed by a description of the data in section IV. In
section V we describe the empirical methodology. The main results are analyzed in section VI,
followed by concluding remarks in section VII.


2       Literature review
The literature on political business cycles has traditionally identified two sources of politically mo-
tivated economic cycles. In the opportunistic political cycles models, politicians utilise electoral
periods as an opportunity to increase their reelection chances by promoting positive shocks to the
economy in the period before elections1 . In the partisan cycles models, business cycles are partially
caused by changes in economic policy according to the different ideological positions of the elected
parties2 . In the present study, we are specifically interested in opportunistic cycles at the local level
in Brazil and in how they relate to term limitations3 .
    In the last 20 years, the empirical literature on political budget cycles (PBCs) has generated a good
range of findings and explanations about their nature and mechanics, promoting a rich discussion on
the topic. For instance, many studies have confirmed the classical theoretical view of pre-electoral
increases in deficits (Brender & Drazen (2005); Shi & Svensson (2006); Veiga & Veiga (2007)), while
others have only found increases in certain types of expenditures, but not in overall spending or
deficits (Drazen & Eslava (2010); Schneider (2010)). These later studies were aligned somewhat with
the “voters as fiscal conservatives” concept (Brender (2003); Brender & Drazen (2008); Peltzman
(1992)), for which the median voter prefers less - rather than more - government spending and thus

(1976); Nordhaus (1975) and Tufte (1975) - among others - who focused on cycles in monetary (macro) variables.
Subsequent studies have switched attention to political cycles in fiscal variables, being the works Frey & Schneider
(1978a); Frey & Schneider (1978b); Rogoff (1990); Rogoff & Sibert (1988) and Tufte (1978) the main initial references.

and partisan budget cycles in Brazilian municipalities.

punishes - rather than rewards - electoral year increases in deficits4 .Yet, Drazen & Eslava (2010)
explain that voters’ fiscal conservatism is perfectly aligned with opportunistic PBCs in certain types
of expenditures. They develop a model in which fiscal conservative voters are averse to higher public
spending in general, but have an appetite for particular types of targeted spending. As a result,
PBCs can take place via a change in the composition of spending, leaving total spending and budget
balances unchanged. They confirm their predictions using data on local elections in Colombia5 .
    Following a different perspective, Jones, Meloni & Tommasi (2012) explain that increases in
overall spending are perfectly consistent within a “voters as fiscal liberals” context. They argue that
in some federalist systems, such as those in Argentina, Brazil and Russia, the local provision of public
services is mostly financed by federal funds - and not by local tax revenues - with the result that
rational voters demand more government spending rather than less. Their main argument is that in
the context of fiscal federalism, local voters may reap the benefits of public spending without directly
paying for its costs. They empirically confirm their proposition by analyzing the case of Argentine
fiscal federalism.
    The need to account for the effects of fiscal federalism in the analysis of PBCs have been previously
addressed by Alt & Lassen (2006), who have highlighted the important role played by regional
and local governments in fiscally decentralized political systems. The authors claim that central
governments operating in these systems can affect fiscal outcomes at the local level through the
strategic allocation of discretionary transfers. One good example is found in Berry, Burden & Howell
(2010), who examine the distribution of federal outlays in the United States to conclude that districts
and counties whose legislative representative belongs to the president’s party are systematically
rewarded with more federal transfers. Larcinese, Rizzo & Testa (2006) reach similar findings at the
state level, showing that American states with governors belonging to the president’s party receive
more federal funding. However, neither studies test if these politically motivated transfers increase
or not during elections. Yet, other studies have combined the analyses of tactical allocation with
political fiscal cycles. Rumi (2008) and Lema & Streb (2013), for example, show that Argentine
provinces politically aligned with the central government receive more voluntary federal transfers in
election years. Ferreira & Bugarin (2007) reach similar conclusions for the Brazilian federal system,
showing that mayors who are politically aligned with either the President or State Governors receive
more voluntary transfers from these upper government levels during elections.
    Recently, studies on political cycles have emphasized that the presence and magnitude of electoral
fiscal cycles are conditioned on certain institutions and political and economic contexts (Aidt, Veiga
& Veiga (2010); Brender & Drazen (2005); Franzese & Jusko (2008); Rose (2006); Schneider (2010);
Shi & Svensson (2006); Vergne (2009)). A good survey on the conditional political budget cycles
literature is found in De Haan & Klomp (2013a), who discuss the role of various factors influencing
political fiscal cycles, such as development levels, democratic experience, political institutions and
fiscal rules. Following the well-cited works of Brender & Drazen (2005) and Shi & Svensson (2006) for
example, for whom the presence and magnitude of fiscal cycles are greatly dependent, respectively,
on the democratic experience and on the development levels of countries, many scholars have come
to agree that young developing democracies are particularly prone to fiscal opportunism. However,
some recent studies have shown that governments in developed and democratic nations also enact
opportunistic fiscal cycles depending on their political and institutional conditions. Alt & Lassen
(2006) examine a panel of 19 OECD countries over the nineties to conclude that electoral year
deficits are significantly higher in developed countries with lower fiscal transparency and higher
political polarization. Streb, Lema & Torrens (2009) present evidence that PBCs are present in both
   4
     Arvate, Avelino & Tavares (2009) analyze state-level elections for governors in Brazil and show that Brazilian
voters are in general fiscal conservatives, but after controlling for some measurements of voters’ sophistication (such
as income, inequality and education), more naive voters punish deficits much less severely.

young and established democracies when legislative checks and balances over executive discretion
are weak. Other studies focused on subnational governments in developed and democratic countries
have shown that strict fiscal rules have important limiting effects on political budget cycles (Rose
(2006); Schneider (2010))6 .
    Term limits are a key institutional rule to be considered in the analysis of conditioned political
cycles, but have been somewhat neglected by the literature. Most existing studies on term limits
are restricted to legislative mandates 7 . In those in which the chief executive is the central object of
analysis, the focus has been on differences in the average fiscal behaviour of term limited and non-
term limited incumbents, with no particular emphasis on the crucial role of elections. This omission
is critical, once the prospects of holding office in the future are considered the key driver for the
emergence of opportunistic fiscal policies (Rogoff (1990)). In the absence of reelection incentives,
fiscal cycles should be mitigated, since a term limited incumbent would have no incentive to signal
superior competence levels during elections.
    The paper by Besley & Case (1995) is perhaps the most famous study addressing the effects of
executive term limits on fiscal performance. They develop and test a model in which incumbents care
more about their reputation if they are eligible to run for a second mandate. Therefore, when two
(or more) terms are allowed, incumbents who provide higher first-term payoffs to voters have higher
chances of being reelected8 . Based on data for 48 U.S. states from 1950 to 1986, their results show
that governors who cannot stand for reelection tax and spend more during their whole mandate,
deviating from the preferences of the median fiscal conservative American voter (Peltzman (1992)).
    Still within American states but in a relatively different perspective, List & Sturm (2006) find
evidence that term-limited U.S. governors do not only modify the management of fiscal indicators, but
also the implementation of environmental policies. The recent paper by Alt, Mesquita & Rose (2011)
deepens the analysis on the effects of term limits on accountability and competence in U.S. states.
By exploiting variations in term limits across space and time both within and between American
states and also controlling for tenure in office, they find that under reelection-eligible incumbents,
economic activity is higher and taxes and spending lower compared to term-limited incumbents who
have equal years of experience in office, which is evidence of an accountability effect. Moreover, when
both incumbents are not eligible for reelection, policy outcomes are better under second (last) term
incumbents than under first (last) term ones, confirming a competence effect.
    Johnson & Crain (2004) extend the empirical strategy of Besley & Case (1995) to a panel of demo-
cratic countries and find that last term incumbents who cannot run for reelection promote higher
increases in expenditures and taxes. They point that these effects are stronger under a single-term
limit rule than under a two-terms limit one. However, while a two-terms limit system is associated
with lower size of government, it promotes higher fiscal volatility. Nogare & Ricciuti (2011) reach
substantially different findings in their recent cross-country analysis: their results reject any signifi-
cant effects of term limits on overall spending and budget deficits. The only significant (but negative)
effect of term limits is found in social services and welfare expenditures in presidential systems. The
authors explain that this finding is consistent with the idea that term-limited incumbents care less
about their reputation, since lower provision of social spending might well be contrary to the fiscal
   6
      In a recent empirical work, De Haan & Klomp (2013b)analyse 65 democratic countries between 1975 and 2005
to show that the presence of political budget cycles varies significantly, comprising both developing and developed
countries, as well as young and old democracies
    7
      See, for instance, the recent study by Aidt & Shvets (2012) and the references therein. By analysing the allocation
of pork barrel spending within legislative districts in seven US states, the authors show that term limited legislators
reduce the amount of state transfers to their districts when they cannot seek reelection.
    8
      Smart & Sturm (2006) offer a theoretical model in which reputational concerns may be inefficient in the absence
of term limits. Their main conclusion is that a two-terms limit system (or more) is preferable to a single or no-term
limit system, because in those systems, there is a combination of selection and truthfulness effects, where voters are
able to select the best incumbents and these have little incentive to deviate from their true type even in their first
terms.

preferences of fiscal liberal voters in such presidential systems.
    Out of U.S. states and cross-country comparisons, studies relating term limits and PBCs at the
local level are scarce. For example, the works of Rosenberg (1992) in Israel, Meneguin & Bugarin
(2001) and Nakaguma & Bender (2006) in Brazil or Aidt, Veiga & Veiga (2010) in Portugal are
mainly interested in analyzing the relationships between reelection probabilities, the incumbent’s
decision to run for reelection and political cycles, but not in addressing the issue of term limits. The
difference is that while term limits are an exogenous condition, the decision to run is an endogenous
choice of the incumbent.
    It is clear from the literature review above that studies concerned with the relationships between
term limits and political budget cycles are mainly restricted to the U.S. states and to a few cross-
country analyses. The present paper fills this gap by exploring the effects of term limits on political
budget cycles in local governments in Brazil. In this respect, our sample of Brazilian municipalities
allows us to hold relevant institutional and economic factors constant, which is always a challenge
in cross-country analysis (Schneider (2010)). Moreover, this paper’s econometric specification and
choice of variables explicitly control for potential sources of tactical allocation between the federal or
state governments and municipalities, allowing a precise estimate of the marginal effects of term limits
on local fiscal choices. Additionally, this study compliments the most recent conditional political
budget cycles literature (De Haan & Klomp (2013a)) as Brazil, a young developing presidential
democracy, has implemented important institutional changes affecting elections and fiscal policies in
the past 15 years. Among those, we focus specifically on the Reelection Amendment (Constitutional
Amendment n. 16, 1997), which relaxed restrictions on term limits - from one-term to two-terms
term limits - allowing executive chiefs to run for reelection for one consecutive term. More precisely,
we look at how differences in term limits affect the fiscal behaviors of mayors in Brazil, especially
during elections. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to address the effects of term
limits on fiscal policy at the local level in Latin America9 .


3       Institutional context
Brazil is organized as a republican federation under a presidential system. Its federalist structure
comprises three autonomous and independent government levels: the Union, 26 states (plus the
federal district, holding the capital Brası́lia) and 5,565 municipalities. With almost 140 million
voters, Brazil is one of the most politically decentralized countries in the world. Upon the ending of
military dictatorship in 1984 and with the new Constitution of 1988, elections have been held in a
regular basis with fixed dates (usually in October), making the electoral calendar strictly exogenous
and perfectly known in advance by both voters and politicians. Having experienced fourteen regular
and democratic elections since then, the country can be considered a young developing democracy.10
    Until the 1998 national elections, chief executives (President, state governors and city mayors)
stood in office for four years only. But with the Reelection Amendment approved in 1997, term limits
have been extended to allow for an extra four-year term in office in the case of reelection, permitting
eight consecutive years in office. In the case of local governments, the elections held in 2000 were the
first in which all incumbent mayors were allowed to run for reelection11 .
    9
      Ferraz & Finan (2011) addressed the effects of term limits on Brazilian mayors’ political corruption, but not on
fiscal policies. Their results suggest that Brazilian mayors in their first term are less corrupt than those in their second
and last term.
   10
      Chief executives of the three government levels are chosen by a majority rule, whereas Legislative council members
are appointed by a proportional rule. Elections for mayors in cities with more than 200,000 voters follow an absolute
majority rule in a two-round system, where the candidate who receives more than 50% of the valid votes in the first
round is elected. If that percentage is not reached, then the two highest-polling candidates meet again in a second and
final round. In cities with less than 200,000 voters, a one round system based on a simple majority rule is adopted.
   11
      In our sample of 3,393 municipalities, 2,112 incumbent mayors ran for reelection in 2000 (62%), from which 1,227
were reelected (36%).


                                                             6
    Local politics play an important role in the Brazilian federal system. First, the new democratic
constitution of 1988 established that the federal, state and municipal governments are commonly
responsible for the provision of a wide variety of policies. However, it also established that most public
services should be provided primarily by local administrations, with state and federal governments
assuming a subsidiary role. Second, although the fiscal structure in the Brazilian federal system is
characterized by high centralization of tax revenues at the federal level, there is high decentralization
of expenditures and provision of public services at the local level. For the average municipality,
for example, local taxes represent little more than 6% of its total revenues. But while the average
Brazilian municipality is highly dependent on federal and state transfers (both legal and discretionary
ones), there is some considerable level of discretion over expenditure allocation. Hence, to the eyes
of local citizens, mayors hold the main responsibility for the level and quality of local public services.
Finally, municipalities constitute the smaller electoral district in Brazil, being therefore the main
geographical unit where votes are cast in local, state and national elections. As a result, much of the
political game is played at the municipal level.
    In the past 15 years, Brazil has undergone important institutional changes affecting the electoral
and fiscal incentives of politicians. Three deserve particular attention: the Reelection Amendment
(of greater concern here), the new Electoral Legislation and the Law of Fiscal Responsibility. The
Reelection Amendment affected fiscal outcomes by promoting different electoral incentives for incum-
bents in their first and last terms, as have been discussed by the literature on term limits 12 . This
paper contributes to this discussion by exploring the different electoral incentives faced by Brazilian
mayors in their first and last terms13 .
    Whereas fiscal opportunism has expectedly increased with the Reelection Amendment, it was
probably counterbalanced by the effects of the new Electoral Legislation (Federal Law n. 9504, 1997).
According to this law, incumbent politicians are legally impeded, three months before elections, to
participate in the inauguration of public works; to implement administrative changes affecting staff,
public employees and civil servants (especially promoting new hires and nominations) and to make
voluntary transfers to lower government levels (from the Union to states and municipalities, or from
states to municipalities). Additionally, six months before elections, incumbent politicians cannot
adopt revision of salaries and payments of public employees to a level in excess of the inflation rates
prevailing in the ongoing election year. Thus, the Electoral Legislation most probably reduced the
scope for fiscal opportunism in some expenditures, especially those related to current spending, such
as personnel expenditures for instance.
    As for the Law of Fiscal Responsibility (Complementary Law n. 101, 2000), known as one of the
most relevant and comprehensive fiscal adjustment plans in Brazilian history, a series of limitations
and rules related to the fiscal management of all government levels were created, especially restricting
new deficits and debts. For example, it imposed limits on the share of personnel expenditures over
net current revenues. It also introduced new rules promoting transparency, control and monitoring
of fiscal activity, providing voters greater access to governments’ budgets as well as a greater ability
to evaluate governments’ fiscal performance.
    While in this paper we are particularly concerned with the effects of the Reelection Amendment
on fiscal policy, our analysis must take into account that Brazilian mayors are restricted by the
Electoral Legislation and the Law of Fiscal Responsibility. In this scenario, we propose that the
ideal place to look for evidence of political cycles is not in total spending or budget deficits, but
mainly and mostly in changes in the composition of the budget (Drazen & Eslava (2010); Rogoff
(1990); Schneider (2010)). From this perspective, politicians may engage into opportunistic fiscal

    Although mayors, state governors and the President are limited to hold office for only two consecutive terms, they
can run again for the same post after a one-term hiatus (four years), which should make them more concerned about
future reputation and thus more accountable today. In the case of mayors, however, Ferraz & Finan (2011) explain
that the low probability of returning to political office again makes the average second-term mayor to behave as a

policies by moving from less visible to more visible and electorally effective types of spending, without
increasing total expenditures or promoting deficits. Regardless of whether Brazilian voters are fiscal
conservatives (Peltzman (1992)) or fiscal liberals (Jones, Meloni & Tommasi (2012)), we believe that
the current institutional setting in Brazil has resulted in politicians having “one hand tied behind
their backs”, where the change in the composition of the budget becomes a second best strategy
(Schneider (2010)).


4      Data description
The data set used in this study contains electoral, fiscal and economic variables for a sample consisting
of an eight years (2001-2008) balanced panel of 3,393 Brazilian municipalities, which represents 61% of
the 5,565 municipalities14 . Electoral data were obtained from the Superior Electoral Tribunal, while
municipal fiscal data were taken from the Secretary of National Treasury. The source of demographic
and economic data, in turn, is the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. All fiscal variables
are in real per capita terms, in Brazilian currency units (Real-R$) at 2008 prices (adjusted by using
the IPCA). It is important to clarify that the time frame under analysis includes two local mandates,
namely, 2001 - 2004 (mayors elected in October of 2000) and 2005 - 2008 (mayors elected in October
of 2004), so that in each of them, there are both mayors who can and cannot run for a subsequent
mandate15 .
    Various budget categories for the fiscal dependent variables are analyzed in this study, namely:
(i) Budget Balance; (ii) Total Spending; (iii) Local Tax Revenues; (iv) Current Expenditures; (v)
Personnel Expenditures and finally (vi) Capital Investments. These fiscal variables were chosen
based on both their traditional presence over the PBC literature and on their relevance for testing
opportunistic fiscal cycles at the municipal level in Brazil. According to the classical PBC hypothesis,
one should expect a decrease in revenues (especially tax revenues) and an increase in spending during
elections, leading to a decrease in the fiscal balance. Following the most recent literature, focused on
the change in the composition of spending under a fiscal conservative context (e.g. Schneider (2010);
Drazen & Eslava (2010)), one should expect increases in those types of expenditures which voters
care more about and decreases in those that are found to be less attractive to the electorate, so that
the overall balance should remain unchanged.
    Table 1 is a good starting point to begin our analysis of the effects of term limits on political budget
cycles at the municipal level in Brazil. The last column from the table indicate that the percentage
share of tax revenues, current expenditures and personnel expenditures (over total revenues) are
reduced during elections to a greater extent under first term mayors than under last term mayors.
First term mayors also present a relatively greater increase in the share of capital investments during
elections compared to last term mayors. This change in the composition of the budget (reductions in
current expenditures and increases in capital investments) comes with an improvement in the budget
balance, as capital expenditures represent a much smaller fraction of total spending than current
expenditures. Thus, a small reduction in the share of current expenditures followed by a similar
percentage increase in the share of capital investments allows for an improvement in the budget
balance.
  14
     Due to data unavailability for important variables, the remaining 2,172 municipalities had to be excluded from
the sample. This exclusion could theoretically generate a sample bias if quality and consistency of fiscal reporting is
an attribute of the “best” local administrations. In this sense, the true effects of fiscal opportunism might be different
than those found here. For instance, the excluded municipalities might present worse fiscal conditions than those in
the present sample.

5      Empirical methodology
This study builds on the work of Besley & Case (1995) by testing not only the effects of term limits
on the fiscal choices of incumbents for their whole mandate, but in particular, their specific behaviour
in election years. We test for the presence and magnitude of opportunistic fiscal cycles in Brazil using
the following linear dynamic panel model:


F Vit = α + fi + γ.F Vit−1 + β1 .ELECt + β2 .T ERMit + β3 .(ELECt .T ERMit ) + Control V ariables + it
                                                                                                       (1)
    where the dependent variable F Vit is the natural log of a fiscal variable observed for municipality i
in year t (excluding the budget balance, measured in absolute terms as it can assume negative values),
α, fi and it are, respectively, the constant term, the municipal fixed effects and the idiosyncratic
error. The variable ELECt is a time dummy equal to 1 in the electoral year and 0 otherwise, while
T ERMit is an individual dummy equal to 1 for a first term mayor and 0 for a second term mayor.
The interaction ELECt ∗ T ERMit is the main variable of interest in this study, which is equal to 1
for a first term mayor in an election year and 0 otherwise. Thus, β3 identifies the additional positive
fiscal stimulus in an election year resulting from the possibility of reelection.
    According to the main PBC hypotheses, it is expected that β3 > 0 for expenditure variables
(on average, first term mayors increase public spending during electoral years more than second
term mayors) and β3 < 0 for revenues variables (on average, first term mayors reduce taxation
and collection during electoral years more than second term mayors). Given this pattern of higher
spending and lower revenue collections, it is expected that β3 < 0 for the overall budget balance.
    The set of control variables accounts for other political and demographic determinants of fiscal
policy, namely: (i) the lag of constitutional transfers received by municipalities from both state and
federal governments, accounting for legally determined resources available to local  P governments; (ii)
the index of votes fractionalization in the last election, given by the formula 1 − Jj=1 vj2 , in which vj
is the share of votes obtained by each candidate j running for mayor at municipality i - the higher the

                                                                    9
index, the more fragmented are voters’ preferences, making it harder for the mayor to define what set
or mix of fiscal policies are more electorally effective; (iii) a dummy indicating the political alignment
between the mayor’s and the governor’s parties and (iv) a dummy indicating the political alignment
between the mayor’s and the president’s parties - following similar arguments as those presented
by Ferreira & Bugarin (2007), Lema & Streb (2013) and Rumi (2008), it could be that mayors
whose parties belong to the governor’s and/or President’s parties receive more voluntary transfers
and grants from the state and/or federal governments, especially during electoral periods; and (v)
two political dummies - right and left - indicating the ideological orientation of the mayor’s party, in
order to account for potential partisan effects on fiscal policy16 . As demographic controls, we included
(vi) total population, (vii) proportion of elderly (people over 65 years old) and (viii) young (people
below 14 years old) living in each municipality. The inclusion of population size is used to account
for the demand for government services and also for the degree of political accountability, which is
thought to be inversely proportional to the size of the electoral district (Porto & Porto (2000)). The
age structure of the population (proportion of elderly and young) has become a standard approach
in the PBC literature for capturing variations in the demand for government services (Brender &
Drazen (2005); Rose (2006); Sakurai & Menezes Filho (2011); Veiga & Veiga (2007)).
    Given that fiscal variables usually exhibit persistence over time, the estimations include the first
lag of the dependent variable as an additional regressor. However, as is well known, the inclusion of
a lagged dependent variable and of municipal fixed effects lead to inconsistent OLS estimators. First
differencing Equation 1 eliminates the fixed effects, but results in ∆F Vit−1 being correlated with
∆it . To solve this endogeneity problem, estimations were performed according to the System-GMM
(General Method of Moments) procedure proposed by Blundell & Bond (1998), which uses lags of
the dependent variable, in levels, as instruments for the differenced equation, and one lag of the
dependent variable, in differences, as instruments for the level equation. Additionally, the standard
errors were clustered at the municipal level and adjusted for finite sample sizes using the Windmeijer
(2005) correction.


6     Results
In this section, we present the results generated from the estimation of Equation 1 for the six selected
fiscal variables using the Blundell & Bond (1998) system-GMM method. The list of instruments,
Sargan tests of instrument validity and the m1 and m2 tests of absence of first and second-order
correlated errors terms are reported at the bottom of the tables. The Windmeijer (2005) robust
standard errors (corrected for finite samples) are reported in parentheses.
    The main variable of interest is the interaction ELECt ∗ T ERMit (Electoral Year x First Term
Mayor), which identifies the difference in the examined fiscal variable between first term and second
term mayors over the electoral and non-electoral periods (β3 ). Two other important variables captur-
ing the effects of elections and term limits on fiscal policy are ELECt (Electoral Year) and T ERMit
(First Term Mayor). The results regarding ELECt correspond to the electoral year difference in
fiscal variable for second term mayors (β1 ), while the results for T ERMit identifies the difference in
the term’s average fiscal variable (non-electoral years) between first term and second term mayors
(β2 ).
    Before reviewing the results displayed in Table 2, note that all the estimations comply with the
Sargan test, i.e. the selected set of instruments exhibits no correlation with the error term. Addi-
tionally, the m2 test indicates that the differenced error term exhibits no second-order correlation.
Also, the first lag of the dependent variable is significant only in the case of overall budget balance
(positive) and capital investments (negative), suggesting that throughout the period under analysis,

and Rodrigues (2002).

budget balances have improved and investments have deteriorated.
   The figures in Table 2 confirm the presence of political cycles in local tax revenues, current ex-
penditures and capital investments at the local level in Brazil, but not in the budget balance, total
expenditures or personnel expenditures. While mayors in their second (and final) term increase taxes
and current expenditures during elections (see the positive coefficients for Electoral Year), first term
mayors do exactly the opposite (see the negative coefficients for the interaction Electoral Year x
First Term). A similar but inverse pattern occurs for capital investments: while last term mayors
reduce investments in election years, first term mayors substantially increase them. Fiscal differences
over the term in office (non-electoral years) are practically negligible (see the statistically insignifi-
cant coefficients for First Term Mayor), with the exception being smaller levels of total expenditures
under first term mayors. These figures show that first term mayors behave opportunistically by
promoting reductions in local taxation and in current expenditures and increases in capital invest-
ments. Moreover, they do so without affecting the budget balance, overall spending or personnel
expenditures.

    The above results suggest that term limits are an important source of variation in fiscal policies
during electoral years. First term mayors, facing the reelection incentives presented by another term
in office and having the objective of maximizing their reelection probability subject to electoral and
fiscal constraints, seem to adopt the so-called “change in the budget composition approach” (Drazen
& Eslava (2010)). By changing the allocation of budgetary resources in electoral periods, first term
mayors increase the types of expenditures which are more visible and presumably more appealing to
voters (i.e. investments) while keeping a controlled fiscal balance.
    These findings are somewhat contrary to the predictions presented by Rogoff (1990). According
to Rogoff’s model, there should be an increase in government consumption spending during elec-
tions and a decrease in capital expenditures. The proposed explanation is that while government
consumption spending is contemporaneously observed by voters and offer direct benefits (such as
transfers and subsidies), capital expenditures are observed only with a time lag. As examples of
capital expenditures, Rogoff (1990) cites investments in national defense (which could be hidden
from the eyes of the public due to security reasons), vesting of public pensions, off-budget loan guar-
antees and other types of capital expenditures whose effects are only observed in the future. The
assumptions by Rogoff (1990), however, do not really apply to Brazilian municipalities. For exam-
ple, expenditures related to national defense, debt service, subsidies to specific sectors and loans are
mostly concentrated in the federal government, thus not so relevant for an understanding of political
cycles at the municipal level. As for increases in wages and salaries of civil servants and government
employees, they are strongly restricted by the Electoral Legislation and Law of Fiscal Responsibility
and are thus difficult to manipulate. Besides, since most local current expenditures are channelled
to cover bureaucratic and administrative needs (such as personnel expenditures, expenditures on
utilities and other purchases of goods and services), it is not obvious that they are readily visible to
citizens or have any positive and direct impact on voters’ welfare. The opposite is true for capital
investments: comprising the acquisition of new equipment, machinery and other capital goods (such
as new ambulances, school buses and medical equipment), as well as investments on infrastructure
projects (construction of roads, schools, hospitals, social houses, etc), these are highly and timely
visible expenditure items (remember that elections take place at the end of the year), besides being
undoubtedly welfare improving. All in all, first term mayors in Brazil with an interest in holding
office for four more years have strong incentives to increase capital expenditures and decrease current
expenditures during elections in order to win the support of voters.
    Turning to the effects of the control variables, we see that lagged values of constitutional transfers
have a positive and significant effect on both tax revenues and expenditures (no significant effects
on budget balance and capital investments), while the effects of political alignment with either the
president or governor on these same variables are negative.
    Constitutional transfers refer to legally determined redistributions and compensations from the
states and the Union to municipalities, based on the shares and quotas the municipalities have
over state and federal tax revenues and on their legal share over natural resource revenues (water,
minerals and oil). Hence, different municipal characteristics are reflected in varying levels of legal
transfers among cities. The results in Table 2 suggest that these legal transfers are associated with
an improvement in local tax collection and in overall current expenditures.
    As for the negative effects observed for the political alignment between mayors and governors or
president, we interpret them as reflecting the various mechanisms through which local public services
are provided directly by the state or federal governments when these are politically aligned with local
administrations. There are many ways in which this is possible: technical cooperation, financial
assistance, in-kind transfers, grants, services provided by decentralized state and federal agencies at
the regional and local levels, and through parliamentary amendments to the state and federal budgets.
In the latter case, state and federal deputies belonging to the government coalition may allocate direct
resources to politically connected mayors. Note that the effects of federal alignment are somewhat
greater than those of state alignment. This result may reflect the practice of fiscal federalism in

Brazil, where the vast majority of municipalities are highly dependent on federal assistance. Finally,
it is worth mentioning that while mayors’ political alignment with the state government is associated
with decreases in budget balances, these are improved when mayors are politically aligned with
the federal government. A possible explanation is that the high degree of dependence on federal
assistance (especially in the form of voluntary transfers, such as current and capital transfers grants)
on the part of most municipalities obligates them to comply with some of the stringent fiscal rules
imposed by the federal government17 .
     In order to pursue a deeper analysis of the different incentives faced by first and second term
mayors, we decided to investigate whether or not the results change when we compare first term
mayors who actively exercise their option to run for reelection to second term mayors. This is an
important distinction, given that not all first term mayors do in fact run for reelection - in our data
sample, in 2004 elections, among 2,166 first term mayors (i.e.mayors able to be reappointed), only
1,352 ran for a subsequent period of government. In 2008, these values were equal to 2,605 and 1,860,
respectively. Therefore, our previous results on the effects of term limits on political cycles, based
on the comparison of first term mayors and second term mayors, are probably underestimating the
reelection incentives of term limits. Since we expect reelection runners to enact even higher levels of
fiscal opportunism, we test this possibility further below.
     As the decision made by eligible candidates to run for reelection is clearly endogenous, (i.e. it
is the politician’s choice, influenced by a set of determinants), we performed estimations in line
with the traditional method proposed by Heckman (1979). At first, we undertook a fixed effects
(or conditional) logit regression estimating the probability of an eligible candidate running for a
subsequent mandate, including the following set of controls: political variables: (i) dummies for
political alignment with State and Federal executive government levels, separately for the first and
last two years of the local mandate18 - these variables were included in order to capture the poten-
tial effect of political support coming from higher levels of government at the executive branch;(ii)
share of votes obtained by the mayor’s party in the elections for state and federal deputies, which
indicates the potential degree of legislative support the mayor enjoys from higher government lev-
els. The higher are these vote shares, the greater may be the allocation of budgetary amendments
proposed by the deputies to the municipality; (iii) fractionalization index of votes in the previous
local election, in order to control for the heterogeneity of voter’s preferences; fiscal variables: (iv)
the amount of discretionary grants (current and capital) received from superior (State and Central)
levels of government during the whole local mandate (both in natural logarithm), so as to capture
the prospects of resources availability coming from upper government levels which can be subject
to tactical allocation; demographic variables: municipality’s (v) total population (in logs); (vi)
proportion of elderly and (vii) young population; mayors’ personal characteristics: (viii) age of
the mayor (and its square value, in order to capture any non-linear effect), (ix) a dummy for gender
(equal to 1 if the mayor is male); (x) a dummy for public servant and finally, (xi) a dummy indicating
whether the candidate holds a university degree.
     Results generated by the fixed effects logit model are presented in Table 3. Starting with the
political variables, mayors are more likely to run for reelection when their party also holds office in
both Federal and State governments during the second half of the mandate. On the other hand, this
likelihood appears to be lower when the alignment with State and Central government occurs during
the first half of a mayor’s mandate. Higher share of votes for state and federal deputies appear to
reduce the mayors’ probability of running for office again, although only the latter is statistically
significant. This negative correlation runs counter to our initial predictions. However, we interpret
  17
     In its articles 23 and 51, for example, the Law of Fiscal Responsibility states that subnational governments may
no longer receive voluntary transfers or sign credit operations if they do not comply with the cap limits on personnel
expenditures (article 23) or do not report their accounting summaries within the pre-scheduled dates (article 51).
  18
     Local elections in Brazil are staggered with State and Federal elections, so that the political alignment between
local and higher levels of government can vary within a given local mandate.

this result in a similar fashion as in Castro & Martins (2013): a party’s increased political status at
higher government levels increases the mayor’s political career options at the end of his term. As we
already mentioned, many first term incumbents give up running for reelection as mayors. It could
be that some of them opt for a legislative career. In any case, we would need more information to
investigate this further. Finally, a higher fractionalization of votes in the previous election increases
the probability that a mayor runs for reelection. The reason is that higher fractionalization of votes
indicates a wider distribution of votes among competing parties, meaning that electoral contests in
these cases are more openly fought.
    As for discretionary transfers received by mayors throughout their mandates, only the amount of
current grants seems to have a positive and statistically significant (at 10%) effect on the decision to
run for reelection - the coefficient regarding capital transfers grants is not statistically different from
zero.

    Finally, concerning mayors’ personal characteristics, our estimations suggest that age decreases
(at a decreasing rate) the likelihood of a mayor choosing to run for reelection. A negative effect is
also observed for male and public servant, suggesting that male mayors who have a previous position
in the public sector are less likely to run for another term than females or mayors with no history in
public service.
    As an additional step to solve the endogeneity present in a mayor’s decision to run for reelection,
we included the Inverse Mills Ratio (calculated according to the logit estimation19 )as a regressor in
 19
      Given that second term mayors cannot run for reelection, we replaced the estimated linear probability by zero

Equation 1 and ran it again, but now comparing first term mayors who run for reelection to mayors
in their second and last term (TERM = 1 if the mayor runs for reelection and 0 if he is in second
term). According to the estimations presented in Table 4, one can observe that, except for the case
of total expenditures, the parameter regarding the Inverse Mills Ratio lacks statistical significance,
i.e. there is no evidence of selectivity bias20 .
     Compared to the results from Table 2, the results in Table 4 remain practically unchanged,
except for one important difference: average total expenditures over the term (non-electoral years)
are higher under first term mayors who run for reelection. In fact, as the inverse Mills ratio indicated,
the amount of total expenditures and the decision to run for reelection are closely related21 . All other
results point to the same conclusion: first term mayors who run for reelection act opportunistically
by reducing both local taxes and current expenditures and increasing capital investments in a fiscally
responsible manner, as budget balances and total expenditures remain unchanged during elections.
These figures confirm our initial proposals: given the current institutional setting in Brazil, a greater
degree of fiscal opportunism in capital investments was to be observed relatively to current and
personnel expenditures (refer to discussion in section 3).
     In summary, we find that first term mayors and reelection runners, relative to second term mayors,
reduce tax revenues and move fiscal policy away from current expenditures towards capital invest-
ments in electoral years. This movement appears strange at first, since by employing this strategy,
first term mayors direct fiscal policy away from the budget “heavy weights” accounts (such as cur-
rent expenditures) towards smaller accounting rubrics (such as capital investments). However, the
decision to switch the composition of spending from less visible (and more burdensome) expenditures
to more visible (and fiscally sustainable) ones is consistent with a politician whose objective function
is to maximize his probability of reelection subject to institutional constraints on fiscal manage-
ment. Such fiscal movement is even more relevant if we assume that voters are fiscal conservatives
and evaluate incumbents mostly by observing visible public policies and services, especially during
elections(i.e. voters are short sighted)22 .
     One potential caveat in the study refers to the role of competence. Second term mayors can
be considered especially competent incumbent types, as they survived previous elections and were
reelected by voters. Besides, their longer tenure in local office endows them with more experience of
the administrative and fiscal situation of the municipality. Are our findings affected by competence
differences between first and second term mayors? We believe not. If competent incumbents are those
who deliver the most preferred public services (highly visible and welfare improving expenditures) at
the lowest costs (lower taxes) and with the least negative externalities (lower deficits), then our results
should present significant differences for the First Term Mayor dummy, as it captures differences in
the term’s average fiscal variable (non-electoral years) between first term and second term mayors.
This was not the case. In fact, fiscal differences between first and final term mayors were mostly
observed during elections. The reason is simple: it is precisely during elections that the need to
signal competence and be accountable to voters becomes stronger. Mayors in their second and final
term, although proven to be competent, lack the accountability incentives related to reelection and
do not need to signal competence or build a positive reputation for a next mandate. As a result, the
fiscal policies carried out by last term mayors in the last years of their second mandate should not
deviate much from those followed throughout their term, or at least not as much as those of first
and calculated the Inverse Mills Ratio at this value.
  20
     Similarly to Table 2, the estimations comply with both Sargan and m2 tests for dynamic panel data.
  21
     This somehow echoes the findings in Sakurai & Menezes Filho (2008), for whom higher total spending over the
term increases the mayor’s party reelection probability.
  22
     The literature is still inconclusive about whether Brazilian voters are fiscal conservatives or fiscal liberals. Arvate,
Avelino & Tavares (2009) suggest that voters do not like deficits in general at the state level. Sakurai & Menezes Filho
(2008) show that voters enjoy higher total spending at the local level, but do not test their reaction to deficits.
Theoretically, local voters in the Brazilian fiscal federalism should act as fiscal liberals (Jones, Meloni & Tommasi
(2012)).

effects of elections for incumbents who are not limited to stand for another term in office23 .


7      Concluding remarks
This article tested the effects of term limits on opportunistic political budget cycles (PBC) in mu-
nicipal elections in Brazil, by comparing differences in the fiscal behaviour of first term mayors (who
are allowed to run for a second mandate) and second term mayors (who are prohibited to run for
reelection) during electoral years.
    Based on fiscal and electoral data of 3,393 Brazilian municipalities between 2001 and 2008, this
research has provided strong evidence in favour of significant electoral fiscal differences between
first term and second term mayors. As elections draw close, first term mayors reduce local taxes and
change their budget composition by reducing current expenditures and increasing capital investments.
Importantly, they seem to do so in a fiscally responsible manner, as budget balances and total
expenditures remain unchanged during elections. The results also indicate that the average fiscal
performance delivered by first term mayors during non-electoral years does not significantly differ
from those of final term mayors. In this sense, different levels of competence between first and final
term mayors do not seem to have any specific effect on the fiscal choices implemented throughout
their terms in office. In fact, fiscal differences between both types of mayors are mostly restricted to
electoral periods, a time when the accountability and signalling effects of elections reach their peak.
Finally, the results remained practically unchanged when we compared first term mayors who do in
fact choose to run for reelection to second term mayors.
    These findings are consistent with recently developed signalling models of PBC and with the con-
ditional political budget cycles literature: incumbents aiming at maximizing their reelection chances
subject to institutional restrictions on fiscal deficits seek to signal their competence levels or policy
preferences by changing the composition of the budget in electoral years through the provision of
more visible expenditures to rational and heterogeneous voters who may (or may not) be averse to
higher spending in general, but have a preference for targeted expenditures(Drazen & Eslava (2010)).
    Our findings indicate that reducing term limitations - such as changing from a one-term term
limit system to a two-terms term limit system, as Brazil did recently - is a welcome institutional
mechanism for enhancing electoral accountability and improving voters’ ability to select competent
incumbents. The accountability and selection effects of reduced term limits seem to become even
stronger when combined with other institutional limitations on fiscal profligacy. To better assess
how these conditions affect electoral results, future studies should investigate whether voters respond
positively to such opportunistically targeted, although fiscally responsible, electoral strategies.

     This is close to the ideas present in Alt, Mesquita & Rose (2011). However, the authors focus on performance
differences over the whole term rather than differences during elections.
