       In this paper, we investigated two cases of regions that used expansionary fiscal policies in recent years to
       increase short-term economic activity: the European Monetary Union and Brazil. Using impulse response
       functions, we estimated the effects of fiscal stimuli in a New-Keynesian framework provided by the Markov-
       switching dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (MSDSGE) model. We produced a set of regime-dependent
       results that suggest that 1) economic policies should be analyzed from a coordination perspective and 2) the
       selected cases need continuous institutional development in order to make better use of fiscal instruments and
       to make more accommodative public debt decisions.

1    Introduction
   The effectiveness of economic policy management depends on many factors, including how shocks affect
the economy and policy interactions. There is an increasing need for the coordinated use of economic policy
instruments (ECD, 2002; Tabak and Tabata, 2004; Sehović, 2014; Cevik et al, 2014; Gros and Alcidi, 2015;
Leino and Saarenheimo, 2016). Thus, a variety of approaches to policy interaction and policy dominance emerge,
as found in Chung et al (2007), Fragetta and Kirsanova (2010), Troy and Leeper (2011), Traum and Yang (2011),
Cebi (2012), Bianchi (2012), Barros and Lima (2014), Bianchi and Ilut (2014), Cevik et al (2014), and Kliem
et al (2016).
    The majority of countries that have engaged in expansionary policies in recent years are now facing
difficulties, as indicated by several consecutive periods of fiscal deficits. In this sense, two cases of inflation
targeters (ITers) require our immediate attention, e.g., the European Monetary Union (EMU) and Brazil. While
the first comprises a group of independent sovereign states, the second is a country of sovereign federative
states. In Brazil, the lack of coordination in its economic policies has often been the source of macroeconomic
imbalance. Pires and Andrade (2009) found that the greater the composition of the debt indexed to the short-term
interest rate, the longer the duration of the economic cycle.
    Three arguments lead us to recognize these cases as a singular opportunity for analysis. First, both regions
present common components of business cycle dynamics. Second, the optimal decisions of their fiscal institutions
demand compliance from the member states (EMU) and federative states (Brazil). Third, during the sampled
period (2000-2016), both selected cases of study were experiencing multiple institutional changes that affected
their economic policy coordination and enforcement. From institutions point of view, the monetary policy in
Brazil is executed by the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) and in the EMU it is the European Central Bank (ECB).
The Brazilian fiscal holder, for instance, is the National Treasury Secretariat (STN), from recently created
Ministry of Economy, and in the EMU it corresponds to the European Commission (EC).
    Thus, a conflict potentially emerges, since the institutional obligations of the fiscal holder regarding interest
rates and other goal variables are distinct from those of the monetary holder (Dixit, 2001). The considerable
debt crises in the EMU and Brazil and their effects led to an intense discussion about proposed diagnoses
and the effectiveness of policy recommendations (Checherita and Rother, 2010; Ferreira, 2014; Kramolišová
and Spáčilová, 2015). The EC established the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in 1997, which imposes a
set of restrictions on members concerning deficits and public debt. However, the new scenario of debt crisis
brought the reform of the SGP through the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG) and the
implementation of country specific recommendations (CSRs), which have proven to be difficult in practice (Gros
and Alcidi, 2015).
    In Brazil, the political cycle from the early 2000s was the main platform for short-term economic policies.
The Growth Acceleration Program (Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento – PAC), based on increasing credit
and massive investment in infrastructure, prevails form 2003 to 2006 and 2007 to 2011. Replaced by the New
Macroeconomic Matrix (Nova Matriz Macroeconômica – NME) (2011-2014 and 2016), the exhaustion of the
economic model led to a severe internal crisis also characterized by creative accounting and fiscal peddling
(Chalhoub et al, 2017). It was followed by stagflation (2012Q3-2013Q2 and 2014Q2-2014Q3), over 13 million
Brazilian people unemployed and an impeachment process in 2016. Hence, our motivation is to understand the
role of government expenditure and its effect on macroeconomic indicators in this unique cross-regional case, to
build more effective policy coordination in light of these experiences.
    We first estimate the parameters of policy dominance regimes for the period from 2000 to 2016. Next,
supported by a Markov-switching dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (MSDSGE) model originally proposed
by Davig and Leeper (2011), we simulate the dynamic impact of a positive increase in public spending using
these estimated parameters. This framework allows us estimate the regimes’ parameters and use them as the
contour conditions in the second stage of the modeling. We estimate the steady state and simulate the impulse

                                                         2
response functions (IRFs) of public spending increases to analyze how inflation control, interest rate and debt
sustainability decisions are coordinated. Our paper is divided into five sections in addition to this brief section 1.
In section 2, we present the specification of the economic policy regimes and the MSDSGE setup. The data
sample and the estimation procedures are described in section 3, and the results are presented and discussed in
section 4. Finally, general conclusions are drawn in section 5.


2    Model setup
   Sargent and Wallace (1981) were pioneers in studying the interaction between fiscal and monetary policy
and investigating determinants of the price level. Leeper (1991) describes possible regions for the parameter
spaces, i.e., their interaction and dominance given both forms of economic policy, which may be characterized as
follows: Region I – the monetary authority deploys its policies independently, and there is monetary dominance
(AM/PF), i.e., fiscal policy is passive; Region II – there is fiscal dominance, which is also referred to as active
fiscal policy (PM/AF); Region III – there is passive monetary and passive fiscal policy (PM/PF); Region IV:
there is active monetary and active fiscal policy (AM/AF). AM/PF is characterized by a balanced budget to
promote the stabilization of the debt/GDP relation . Hence, Ricardian theory is viewed as having prevailed.
    The empirical evidence of fiscal-monetary policy coordination has been investigated in many countries using
different models (Dungey and Fry, 2009; Fragetta and Kirsanova, 2010; Cebi, 2012; Algozhina, 2012; Barros and
Lima, 2014; Cevik et al, 2014; Ferreira, 2014; Cazacu, 2015; Kliem et al, 2016). The model considers elements
of New-Keynesian paradigms found in real business cycle theory: nonlinearity and the correct identification
of the matrix of contemporary effects between variables (Blanchard, 2018). The first step is to define the
MS(M)-VAR(p) to represent the changes in monetary and fiscal policy regimes, defined as xt . Then, we estimate
the parameters of the monetary side (αi ) and fiscal side (βi ). Krolzig (2000) describes the MSVAR as

                                 xt = ν(St ) + A1 (St )xt−1 + ... + A p (St )xt−p + εt .                          (1)
ν(St ), A1 (St ),..., A p (St ) are the parameter shift functions and describe the dependence of the parameters on
each realized regime. They indicate that a permanent change in the mean of such parameters in the current
regime causes an immediate jump in the observed time-series stochastic processes to a new once-and-for-all
level, depending only on the current regime. εt |St is a Gaussian term conditioned to each regime st , with
ε|St ∼ i.i.d. (0, ∑(St )). In addition, p is the number of lags, n is the variables’ matrix dimension, and S is the
number of unobserved regime realizations, St ∈ {1, 2} for our case. Therefore, the intercept term in equation (1)
assumes a different value depending on the current regime:
                                                         (
                                                           ν1 , f or St = 1
                                                ν(St ) =                                                        (2)
                                                           ν2 , f or St = 2
    The stochastic processes of policies are such that the probability of being in state k in period (t + 1) depends
only on the current state. The conceived economy includes 1) governments – the fiscal authorities that tax
consumers, buy consumer goods, issue debt, and assume responsibility for the money supply as the monetary
holder; 2) households and 3) firms that produce the final goods in monopoly competition. Finally, the hypothesis
of price frictions (Gali et al, 2003) is assumed, as well as the possibility of market imperfections.
1) Government
    The set of policies is characterized for two transition equations, which represent the monetary (rt ) and
fiscal sides (τt ) of the investigated economies, described in equations (5) and (6), respectively. These equations
underline that 1) monetary policy endogenously depends on the basic interest rate reaction to changes in inflation
and the deviation in the output gap from the calculated values of the steady state and that 2) the government’s

revenue endogenously depends on deviations in public debt; government spending and the output gap, i.e., the
response of taxes to the output gap, change the responses to debt and government purchases. The dynamic
impacts of government purchases are assumed to be as in Davig et al (2006) and according to (Gt ) are

                                   log(Gt ) = log(Ḡ)(1 − ρ) + ρlog(Gt−1 ) + εt .                              (3)
where Gt are government purchases, Ḡ are the steady state government purchases, ρ is the correlation parameter
of government spending, and εt ∼ N(0, σ2 ). Thus, the government’s optimal choice {Gt , Mt , Bt , τt } must satisfy
the flow of its budget identity. Additionally, we adopted the standard concept of the sequential equilibrium of
markets, taking into account the need for market clearing for public funding.

                                   Gt = τt +              + −                                                   (4)

where τt is the government’s purchase-to-output ratio, Bt is a public bond for one period, rt is the interest rate,
Pt is the price level in period t, and Mt is the money supply, with Mt−1 > 0 and (1 − rt−1 )Bt−1 . The inference of
dating non-observable regimes is made by filtering and smoothing the probabilities using the estimator developed
in Hamilton (1990). For parameter estimation, we use the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) originally
described by Dempster et al (1977). Following Equation (1), the fiscal policy rule is

                          τt = γ0 (StF ) + γb (StF )bt−1 + γy (StF )yt + γg (StF )gt + γτ (StF )εtτ .          (5)
where εtτ ∼ N(0, 1), StF indicates the fiscal policy regime, γ0 is the intercept, and γi represents the respective
elasticity parameters, while bt−1 is the debt-to-GDP ratio in (t − 1), and gt is the government’s primary spending
as the GDP ratio. If γb > 0, the fiscal policy is passive, if otherwise, the fiscal policy is active.
      The institutional monetary policy frameworks of the EMU and Brazil are defined by a Markov-switching
forward-looking Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993). The monetary authority manages a loss function, which represents
the side effects of its decisions on investment and the output gap. This rule means that the nominal interest rate,
rt , depends only on inflation πt and the output gap yt and is described as

                                rt = α0 (StM ) + απ (StM )πt + αy (StM )yt + αr (StM )εtr .                    (6)
where πt is the inflation rate, yt is the output gap, α0 is the intercept, αi represents the respective monetary
elasticity parameters and εtr ∼ N(0, 1), and StM indicates the monetary policy regime. Note that for απ > 1 and
αy > 0, monetary policy is active. Otherwise, it is considered passive. Both policies develop according to the
transition probability matrix T ∗ , described as follows:
                                                                     
                                               ∗      probi,i probk,i
                                              T =
                                                      probi,k probk,k
    The elements probi,k of the transition matrix represent the probability of being in regime i and of changing
to regime k, respectively. Hence, the MSDSGE allows us to simulate shocks depending on policy dominance
through the terms εtr (Equation (6)) and εtτ (Equation (5)).
2) Households
    There is an identical continuum number of households j ∈ (0, 1) that receive remunerations for work, i.e.,
nominal wages, then decide the optimal allocation of consumption (Ct ), money and bonds, whose returns are
risk free. Ct is defined as the aggregate value of different consumption goods, Nt is the total amount of hours
worked, and Mt /Pt represents the real money supply. The representative household chooses {Ct , Nt , Mt , Bt } to
maximize the following utility function U:

    After some algebra, optimal price pt∗ , i.e., the first-order condition, assumes that a 1 − ϕ ratio of firms adjust

pt∗ influences firm j’s profits, but it cannot achieve the new optimization.

4) Steady state
    Public debt in the steady state is fixed and independent of the regimes and it is calculated by replacing the
fiscal policy rule in the budget constraint equation of the government, maintaining the deterministic value of the
stationary state output equal to one. The fiscal policy rule for the intercept is solved as follows:

                                                      π                      β−1
                                γ0 (StF ) = G − m(       ) − b(1 + γ(StF ) −     )                             (14)
                                                     1+π                     1+π
where γ0 (StF ) and γ(StF ) change according to the current fiscal regime. This procedure is applied by substituting
the monetary policy rule into the money demand.
    Government purchases affect the equilibrium in this New-Keynesian framework by following transmission
channels: ∆Gt > 0 increases demand for the goods sold by monopolistically competitive intermediate goods-
producing firms. Thus, intermediate goods-producing firms face demand and set prices by raising their demand
for labor. Ceteris paribus, greater labor demand increases real wages (Wt /Pt ) and real marginal costs. Next,
firms (i) that have the option to reoptimize their prices will increase them.


3    Estimation
   We sampled data from the first quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2016. The time series used were
collected from the ECB (EMU), the BCB and the STN (Brazil). Potential output was estimated using the
Hodrick–Prescott (HP) filter proposed by Hodrick and Prescott (1997). All series were calculated for quarterly
frequency, considering the previous period for each observation and removing the seasonal effect. To estimate
the public debt for Brazil, we first decompose the federal revenues into National Treasury revenue (NTR) and
social security revenue (SSR). We performed the LR linearity test and estimated the reaction functions displayed
in Table 1. The monetary and fiscal reaction functions are both nonlinear.

    Seeking robust results, we used different criteria for the changes, e.g., other specifications were tried,
from regime-dependent mean (MSM(M)-VAR(p)) to the regime-dependent intercept and heteroscedasticity
(MSIAH(M)-VAR(p)). Due to insufficient degrees of freedom (micronumerosity), we estimated the MSM(M)-
VAR(p) considering two regimes. Two MSVAR systems of variables were estimated, including 1) monetary
variables: GDP gap, interest rate (Selic rate in Brazil) and inflation and 2) fiscal variables: public debt,
government spending and revenues. The first regime (AM/PF) for the EMU is characterized by the use of
the interest rate as a reaction function to inflation. For regime 2, there is a passive monetary (PM/AF) policy
reaction function for both cases, given that απ < 1. Similarly, in regime 1, the parameter of reaction regarding
the potential output deviations was stationary, and during regime 2, it was negative.
    The parameters associated with the public debt of the EMU were positive and statistically significant,
indicating the AM/PF regime during the analyzed period. However, the parameter was smaller in the second
regime and considered less passive (AM/PF-), while compared to regime 1 (AM/PF+), it was considered more
passive. The fiscal authority had a stronger reaction to the soft budget constraint in the AM/PF+ regime. For
Brazil, the parameters of public debt were positive and statistically significant only in regime 1 (AM/PF). Those
parameters associated with the GDP gap and government spending registered positive signs and were statistically

    Figure 3 in Appendix A (section 5) illustrates the probabilities of regimes 1 and 2. Both were more persistent
than those estimated in Davig and Leeper (2011) and Cevik et al (2014). Previous evidence in Brazil regarding
the AM/PF regime (1995-1997) was also observed in Tanner and Ramos (2003), Gadelha and Divino (2008) and
Barros and Lima (2014). They found that the implementation of the Real Plan was the cause of the changes. In
the EMU, the AM/PF+ regime was observed during 2002Q4-2004Q1 and 2006Q2-2009Q2, while the AM/PF-
regime prevailed during 2004Q2-2006Q1. From a monetary policy perspective, the change in regimes registered
in 2009 indicates an interest rate reduction. However, the AM/PF- regime was characterized by higher interest
rates (2.92%).
    The very recent PM/AF regime, in turn, registered an interest rate of 0.45%. In addition, the change to the
PM/PF- regime (2009Q3-2012Q1). In this period, we verified a reduction in the public deficit as a proportion
of GDP in the bloc. While Davig and Leeper (2011) registered for the US the AM/PF (2000-2001), PM/PF
(2002-2003) and PM/AF (2004-2011) regimes, distinct results were found for the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary and Slovenia by Cevik et al (2014). Figure 1 synthesizes the four possible combinations between
monetary and fiscal policy in the selected cases:

    Among the theoretical considerations, we report that 1) if the expected inflation and the expected marginal
real cost present the same values in time, a firm chooses p∗ to equal the expected marginal real cost; 2) it should
be assumed that a firm expects an increase in marginal real costs in the future. Hence, anticipating this increase,
the firm chooses a p∗ that is higher than the expected marginal real cost, perhaps because it may not be possible
to adjust p∗ when the marginal real cost materializes (front loading); and 3) firms expect an increase in future
inflation that is higher than E(p∗). The lag of one period implies that the relative price of a firm falls. To
compensate, the firm incorporates future changes in the rate of inflation into p∗. This variable is also directly
affected by the proportion of firms that are allowed to update their prices (1 − ϕ). If the proportion of such firms
rises, inflationary inertia also increases.

4    Results
   The EMU’s GDP was below its potential during the periods from 2003 to 2006 and from 2009 to mid-2015,
also consequence of the 2008 crisis (Algozhina, 2012). Assuming that increased public spending would lead to
a rise in private consumption, particularly in the short term, the EC implemented expansionist policies through
fiscal stimulus packages. Fiscal policy was procyclical in the AM/PF+ regime, while it was countercyclical
in the AM/PF-. Besides, in periods of economic expansion our results suggest that governments reduce the
revenue/GDP ratio in the AM/PF+, while in the AM/PF-, this ratio increases. In parallel, with the annualized
inflation near the annual target of 2% (2002 – 2008), seems that the ECB enacted a quantitative easing policy.
This was indicated by the annualized basic interest rate reduction from 4.98% to 0.72% in the fourth quarter of
2009 and its negative correlation with the output gap.
    Furthermore, the public expenditure parameters for both regimes were statistically significant and had
negative signs. These outcomes suggest that an increase in the public spending/GDP ratio reduces fiscal
revenues. As a consequence, the public debt increased from 68.6% of GDP (2008) to 91.3% (2013). From this
period on, this value remained stable at near 90.7% of the EMU’s GDP in 2016. The Brazilian output was below
its potential in the period of 2002 to 2003, 2009 and during 2013 to 2016. It was registered an upward trend
in inflation (over 10% per year) and paradoxically, lower interest rates as well. The period of 2015-2016 was
characterized by rising interest rates, public expenditures in relation to GDP and unemployment for over 13
million Brazilian people. This latter period was marked by so-called creative accounting (2007-2013), which
mitigated and distorted information about public debt sustainability.
    The elasticity of the demand of money, the velocity of monetary circulation and the steady state inflation
rate reflect that Brazil has historically experienced much more difficulty managing inflation than the EMU. The
steady state government spending/GDP, the steady state public debt/GDP, the parameters of debt and the GDP
gap in the AM/PF regime also highlight that fiscal instruments were less elastic in Brazil than in the EMU.
Figure 2 highlights the IRFs, which represent the simulation of positive shocks of 3% on the residues εt of
government spending (equation (5)).

    As expected, the IRFs in Brazil were more elastic than those registered in the EMU and for all regimes, the

output gap increases. A greater magnitude of responses (> 1) is observed in the EMU when the PM/PF- regime
prevails, followed by the PM/PF+. In Brazil, the magnitude of responses (< 1) suggests the relative inefficiency
of public expenditure with respect to GDP. Except for the monetary dominance regime (AM/PF-), there is an
increase in private consumption, as claimed by fiscal theory. In the AM/PF regime, private consumption falls,
consistent with Ricardian theory, and the effect also implies a consumption drop. In the AM/PF regime the
shock suggests that the monetary holder reacts with higher nominal interest rates. Otherwise, the fiscal holder
must raise taxes to finance the increase in incremental expenditures. Thus, the agents incorporate this future
fiscal responsibility into their expectations, e.g., current and future consumption decisions. In contrast, increases
in interest rates were lower than increases in inflation in other regimes.
    According to the hypothesis of monopolistic competition, the inflation increase is explained by two trans-
mission channels: 1) firms observe their real marginal costs and a proportion φ of them are characterized by a
forward-looking price reoptimization function. Thus, they can establish prices in anticipation of inflation. From
another perspective, it is possible that a proportion (1 − φ) of firms with a backward-looking price reoptimization
function produce inflationary inertia, since ceteris paribus they reoptimize their prices by observing their past
real marginal cost; 2) given the increase in government spending, demand increases and, consequently, so does
the production of goods sold by firms in monopolistic competition. This increase in production implies a greater
demand for labor, pushing real wages up, which leads firms to increase the real marginal cost. A posteriori, the
increment of real marginal cost impacts the prices of goods, leading to inflation.
    The closest results for inflation and interest rates were found in Fragetta and Kirsanova (2010), Kliem et al
(2016) for Italy and Cebi (2012) for Turkey. The temporary increase in inflation in the AM/PF regimes is lower
than that in other regimes. Hence, nominal interest rates increase with greater intensity, i.e., twice that observed
in the PM/AF (the most recent regime in the EMU), in which the monetary holder did not react to interest rate
increases. Meanwhile, negative real interest rate variation in the PM/AF and PM/PF regimes were registered in
Brazil. In addition, the real interest rate remains constant in the case of AM/PF, indicating the same proportion
of such changes in terms of increases in inflation.
    However, the real interest rate in the EMU was three times the Brazilian rate during the PM/PF+ regime.
Less elastic expansionary fiscal policies were suggested by the transitory trajectories represented by the IRFs.
Public debt in the EMU increased to 2% (0.5% for Brazil) in relation to the steady state in the AM/PF+ regime.
This trend shows persistence, and after thirty quarters, its deviation is almost 1%, while the corresponding
response for Brazil is near zero. Public debt shows small fluctuations in relation to the steady state for the EMU
and decreases between 1.5% and 2.0% for Brazil in the other regimes. In the EMU, taxes temporarily increased
in the PM/PF+ regime, while in the PM/PF-, there was a 1% of reduction. This suggests a procyclical rule, e.g.,
the output gap had a significant rise in this regime.
    Taxes had more elastic and positive responses in Brazil, registering a maximum of up to 5% in the PM/PF
regime. Furthermore, such outcomes for inflation, real interest rates and public debt differ from Barros and
Lima (2014). We found that taxes peaked at 3% in the EMU and 6% in Brazil during the PM/AF and PM/PF+
regimes, respectively. Comparatively, taxes increased in all regimes for the US in Davig and Leeper (2011),
particularly the PM/PF (up to 2.5%). The debt/GDP ratio rise was almost null in the PM/PF- regime in the EMU
and inelastic in Brazil. Besides, it increases instantaneously and strongly for the US in the PM/PF regime, also
verified for the interest rate. The inflation response in Brazil was lower. As a consequence, the nominal interest
rate was 180% in the US (PM/AF) and 50% in Brazil (AM/PF).
    Considering the very last regimes for Brazil (PM/PF) and the EMU (PM/AF), Brazilian public debt has a
higher opportunity cost than that of the EMU. This is a consequence of the country’s 1) development state and
2) its debt ratio, which is almost 10% greater than similar countries and approximately 50% of GDP. Brazil also
presents fewer degrees of freedom in terms of discretionary conditions for public expenditure decreases. Our
empirical outcomes also support that it is necessary to reform the use of macroprudential tools to make them
more systematic and thus improve the defective macroeconomic EMU policy framework. In addition, the CSRs

                                                        11
must reduce the heterogeneous member states’ impacts on debt conditions to tighten fiscal policy.


5    Conclusion
   The theoretical model of interaction and effectiveness of monetary-fiscal policy was built on micro foundations
and macro-essential characteristics in a New-Keynesian framework. Institutions play a fundamental role in
policy coordination, and their functioning was represented by the changes of regimes. The empirical strategy
consisted of two steps suggested that the rise in public spending increased the output gap and inflation in both
cases, in addition to increasing consumption and debt for the majority of regimes. Changes in the debt ratio and
government budget deficits are found to be linearly and negatively correlated with growth.
    The complex task of achieving fiscal balance in the EMU and Brazil led to public debt crises. Mainly from
2012 to 2016, PM/AF (fiscal theory) was observed in the EMU, which made the TSCG and CSRs necessary.
Nonetheless, the EMU must achieve the real convergence of member states for aggregate expenditure ceiling
establishes a commitment mechanism to countries forecast public expenditures. To stabilize successive primary
deficits, Brazil needs urgent structural in-depth institutional reforms for the next several years. The first step
in this agenda of transition to more accommodative debt management and a better use of fiscal instruments, is
pension reform. Pension reform could deliver a reduction in distortionary tax effects, before tax system reform.
Our results suggest that economic policy should be analyzed from a coordination perspective.
    For economies with special characteristics such as Brazil, the opportunity cost of public choices is especially
high, while for some EMU member states, the budget constraint seems to be a concern as well. Further studies
might address how the debt crisis is endogenously transmitted to public bond risks in an open economy context.
Although not the subject of this study, the influence of the external sector must be observed with caution.
Improvements in macroprudential policy and qualitative analysis of public spending at the microeconomic level
would be welcome as well.
