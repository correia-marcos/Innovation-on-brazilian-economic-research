This study relates to the literature that analyzes the role of securitization in risk-taking by financial
institutions. We analyze the impact of securitization on financial soundness (measured by z-score)
through the two main securitization products in Brazil: Credit Rights Investment Funds (FIDC) and Real
Estate Receivables Certificates (CRI). Hence, based on a panel data analysis regarding 92 financial
institutions from 2003 to 2016 (quarterly data) we performed several regressions for different samples
and methods. The findings suggest that securitization may increase the probability of insolvency risk.
These results may indicate that financial institutions prefer to issue securitization with underlying assets
of higher credit quality in order to obtain positive credit ratings for their financial products.

1. Introduction
         Asset securitization has been used by financial institutions not only as a tool for transferring risks,
but also to diversify and broaden their portfolio by managing their risk. 1 In particular, securitization may
lead to a less careful credit assessment in lending and a decrease in the monitoring of its borrowers by
originator financial institutions.2 Moreover, financial institutions also have incentive to securitize good
credit quality assets in order to obtain a high reputation or credit rating on the financial products offered
in the market (Greenbaum and Thakor, 1987; Instefjord, 2005). This high credit risk retention behavior by
financial institutions associated with a high risk appetite is often cited as one of the causes of the 2007-09
global financial crisis.3 However, the literature does not present conclusive evidence on the effect of
securitization on the financial institutions’ risk taking.
         In order to observe the impact of securitization on risk-taking by financial institutions, this study
presents evidence from the Brazilian experience. It is important to note that, in spite of the recent growth
of structured finance operations, particularly asset securitization, there is little empirical evidence related
to the impact of securitization on insolvency risk in emerging countries. In general, when compared to
developed countries, emerging economies have a less sophisticated capital market and a gap for the
development of structured financial products aimed at meeting complex and highly customized demands.
Nonetheless, the securitization market in Latin America totaled 65 billion dollars in 2016, with Brazil
accounting for 66% (US$ 42.8 billion). In addition, the securitization/GDP ratio in Brazil was
approximately 2.5% in 2016, while in the other countries (Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Chile) this
ratio was less than 1.5% (Standard & Poor’s, 2016).
         This study encompasses the two main securitization products in Brazil: Credit Rights Investment
Funds (FIDC) and Real Estate Receivables Certificates (CRI) issued between 2003 and 2016. These two
products together correspond to 92% of the securitization market in Brazil in this period.4 Hence, this
study considers quarterly data from 52 financial institutions that originated 578 securitization transactions
(141 issues of FIDC and 437 issues of CRI) between 2003 and 2016. In addition, we introduced in the
sample financial institutions that did not use securitization but that have similar size.
         Based on a panel data analysis, we perform several estimates using Fixed Effects method (FOLS),
Robust Least Squares method (MQR), and Systemic Generalized Moments Method (S-GMM). The
findings suggest that securitization may increase the probability of insolvency risk of financial
institutions. These results may indicate that financial institutions prefer to issue securitization with
underlying assets of higher credit quality in order to obtain positive credit ratings for their financial
products.
         A differential of this study is the inclusion of macroeconomic variables in the analysis. Many
studies have concluded that the macroeconomic scenario is the most important factor in determining
bank’s risk-taking (Jiménez and Saurina, 2006, Bonfim, 2009, and Castro, 2013). Furthermore, we take
into account samples from FIDC and CRI due to the underlying characteristics of each market. In
particular, we observe that CRI operations increased considerably since 2010, while FIDC operations
have declined in the same period (CVM, 2017 - http://sistemas.cvm.gov.br/). In brief, due to the
representativeness of the Brazilian securitization market in Latin America and the growth of these
operations, which has underlying assets from real estate financing, this study brings relevant
considerations that can be observed in the case of emerging economies with a developed financial system.

In addition, it contributes to the literature that explores the relationship between securitization and risks in
order to mitigate possible financial crises.5
        This study is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the research in literature regarding the
effects of securitization of assets on financial institutions’ risk-taking. Section 3 presents the specification
and the empirical strategy. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents the regressions and the
interpretation of the results. Finally, section 6 concludes the study.

2. Securitization and insolvency risk
        This section provides a brief review of the main aspects pointed out in the literature that allow us
to conjecture that the securitization of assets can affect the insolvency risk of financial institutions.
Securitization of assets, as a risk transfer mechanism, permits the transference of part of the credit risk
from the originators to outside investors (see, Acharya, Schnabl, and Suarez, 2013). The possibility of
transferring risk has been pointed out as responsible for excessive risk-taking by financial institutions and
therefore the creation of financial crises. Although this idea is compelling, the literature has no conclusive
evidence whether asset securitization has positive or negative impact on the stability of the financial
system.
        Many studies, especially before the subprime crisis, highlight the benefits from securitization
activities due to the distribution of credit risk among investors (Allen and Carletti, 2006; Berger and
Bowman, 2009). According to Loutskina (2011), because securitization provides an additional funding
source, it reduces the need for financial institutions to maintain liquid assets in their balance sheets. In
line with this argument, the results found by Casu et al. (2013) suggest that financial institutions typically
use securitization as a funding mechanism rather than a risk management mechanism. In addition, the
transfer of credit risk provided by securitization can produce a more efficient use of capital and a
reduction of costs for financial intermediation by reducing regulatory capital requirements (Duffie, 2008).
In this sense, Dechow, Myers and Shakespeare (2010) consider that securitization allows the originator of
the transaction to focus credit risk on a part of the capital structure, resulting in a risk-free liability.
        Despite the aforementioned advantages associated with securitization, the high complexity and
lack of transparency of its operations increase investors’ difficulties in assessing potential losses arising
from this financial product. Gorton (2009) states that the asymmetry of information in asset securitization
arises from the loss of information related to the quality of the underlying assets, resulting from the
complex set of structures inherent to the securitization process. Because of private information about asset
quality, financial institutions can use securitization to increase risk-taking and to reduce the monitoring of
their borrowers (see, Parlour and Plantin, 2008; Dell’Ariccia, Igan, and Laeven, 2008; Purnanandam,
2011; Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny, 2012; and, Wang and Xia, 2014).
        Brunnermeier (2009) points out how the transformation of the banking sector with the
consolidation of the new model of banking intermediation (originate to distribute) has altered the
relationship between lenders and borrowers. According to this perspective, securitization and other
structured financial products cause a relaxation of the criteria for lending and, consequently, deterioration
in the credit quality of financial institutions that originate these operations. Keys et al. (2010) taking into
account data on subprime loans in the United States for the period 2001 to 2006 provide empirical
evidence regarding the negative effect caused by securitization on the monitoring of subprime lenders.
        In addition to the analysis of the increase in credit risk due to the decrease in the monitoring of
borrowers, recent studies investigate the effects of securitization on the stability of the financial system.
Because securitization operations reduce the need to maintain liquid assets (Loutskina, 2011; Casu et al.,
2013), these operations result in an increase in the volume of bank loans. Gambacorta and Marques-
Ibáñez (2011), Hirtle (2009), Carbó-Valverde, Marques-Ibanez, Rodríguez-Fernández (2012), Bedendo

   It is important to highlight that de Mendonça and Barcelos (2015) performed an analysis for the relation between
securitization and credit risk for the Brazilian economy. The main drawback in their analysis is that the sample used by these
authors does not permit to observe the entire securitization market. Hence, this study surpass their analysis in several aspects:
(i) we use a sample from FIDC and CRI operations, while they use only a sample from FIDC; (ii) we use macroeconomic
control variables in the models; and (iii) our sample regarding financial institutions an period is larger than that used by them.
                                                                3
and Bruno (2012) provide empirical evidence that securitization has stimulated excessive credit growth
which in turn can affect financial stability.
        A large number of recent studies have used the z-score to analyze the risk of financial institutions
(Boyd and Runkle, 1993; Santos and Winton, 2008; López-Andión et al., 2015). However, the results are
ambiguous and vary according to the type of securitized asset. Bedendo and Bruno (2012), based on a
sample of US commercial banks for the period 2001 to 2009, find empirical evidence of a negative effect
of securitization on bank stability.
        Chen et al. (2017), using data from 342 commercial banks in the U.S. during the period 2002 to
2012, observe that bank loan securitization has a significant and positive impact on z-score. In particular,
these authors show that securitization may encourage excessive risk-taking by banks and have different
impacts between mortgage and non-mortgage securitization. Moreover, the securitization of real estate
assets is not likely to help banks reduce their risk in the short term, while the securitization of non-real
estate assets provides a more efficient transfer of risk.
        The relationship between financial innovations and bank fragility (as measured by z-Score), as
well as the effect of financial innovations on economic growth is analyzed by Beck et al. (2016) from a
sample of 32 countries in the period from 1996 to 2010. The findings denote that financial innovations
imply an increase in bank's fragility, as well as, profit volatility.

3. Framework of analysis
     This section explores our empirical specification and estimation strategy.

3.1. Empirical specification
         In order to verify the effect of securitization of assets on the insolvency risk of financial
institutions we use the following specification as the baseline model:
(1)      𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜂𝑖 + 𝛼𝑆𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝑍𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 ,
where i = 1,2, …, 92 are financial institutions; t = 1, 2, ..., 56 are time periods (quarterly frequency) from
2003 to 2016, regarding securitization market in Brazil, which includes both credit rights transactions
(FIDC) and real estate asset transactions (CRI); RISK is the insolvency risk of the financial institutions as
a result of the z-score measure; SEC is a dummy variable that assumes value equal to 1 from the first
issuance of FIDC or CRI by the financial institutions and value equal to 0 otherwise; 𝑍 is a vector of
financial control variables (capitalization, liquidity and profitability); ηi represents a vector of financial
institution specific factors; and, εi,t is the stochastic error term.
         The z-Score is a measure that reveals how far the bank is from insolvency (Roy, 1952). The z-
Score has been widely used in recent literature as a measure of financial soundness and represents the
number of standard deviations by which profits would have to fall below average in order to deplete
social capital (Nicolo, Jalal, and Boyd, 2006).6 A higher z-score indicates a lower probability of bank
insolvency and, therefore, lower financial fragility.
         In equation (1) the coefficient α measures the effect on the insolvency risk in t due to the
securitization in the previous period. Because the main objective of this paper is to analyze whether
Brazilian financial institutions have used securitization as a tool to transfer part of their risk, the sign of
this coefficient is relevant. A negative α coefficient indicates an increase in the risk of financial
institutions. In other words, we can interpret as a reduction in the bank’s distance from insolvency and
therefore an increase in the likelihood of bank insolvency. This result is in consonance with the idea that,
in order to obtain a high credit rating of the securitized products, banks tend to securitize better-quality
assets and to hold lower-quality assets. On the other hand, a positive α coefficient indicates a decrease in
risk (an increase in z-score). This result is in line with the possibility that banks hold assets of better
quality in their balance sheets in comparison with those passed on to investors through securitization.
         As already discussed in the previous section, the banking literature shows that the use of
accounting variables are important to explain the behavior of risk because they reflect characteristics of

et. al, 2015).

financial institutions. Kashian and Tao (2014) show evidence that high capitalization ratio is associated
with a high z-score. This result is consistent with the interpretation that the greater the capital in relation
to the total risk exposure, the greater the probability that the bank can survive losses. Loutskina and
Strahan (2009) and Loutskina (2011) show that by reducing the need to hold net assets, securitization has
a positive impact on bank lending. Ahn and Breton (2014) point out that by reducing lending monitoring
incentives, securitization reduces ex ante competition, which may affect the efficiency of the lending
market and lead to higher equilibrium profits for banks. Based on the literature on securitization and risk,
financial capitalization (CAP), liquidity (LIQ) and profitability (ROE) are used as control variables.
Hence, equation (1) can be rewritten as:
(2)      𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜂𝑖 + 𝛼1 𝑆𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽1 𝐶𝐴𝑃𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 ,
(3)      𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜂𝑖 + 𝛼2 𝑆𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 𝐶𝐴𝑃𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐿𝐼𝑄𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 , and
(4)      𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜂𝑖 + 𝛼3 𝑆𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽4 𝐶𝐴𝑃𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽5 𝐿𝐼𝑄𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽6 𝑅𝑂𝐸𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 .
         Due to the specificities of the different securitization modalities mentioned in the previous section,
an analysis of how the different products available in Brazil (FIDC and CRI) affect the risk of financial
institutions becomes relevant. Chen et al. (2017) find different impacts of securitization on the z-Score
according to the type of asset underlying the transaction. According to these authors, the securitization of
real estate assets (mortgages) does not help banks reduce their risks in the short term, while securitizing
other types of assets can provide a more efficient transfer of risk. Therefore, in order to capture the
specificities of each product regarding securitization in Brazil, the same models considered for the full
sample are also estimated for the Receivables market (FIDC) and for the real estate receivables market
(CRI) separately.7

3.2. Estimation strategy
         This study uses modeling techniques for panel data. Although the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
method is simple, it is widely used in the literature.8 However, it is important to control unobserved
factors specific to each financial institution through a fixed effect (𝜂𝑖 ). The OLS estimators are sensitive
to the presence of outliers, which may result in the estimation of coefficients that do not accurately reflect
the relation that is intended to be explained. In order to increase the robustness of the results, besides
fixed effect regressions, we also use Robust Least Squares (MQR) method, which consists of a variety of
methods designed to be robust or less sensitive to the presence of outliers (see Yohai, 1987). 9 It is also
important to note that a drawback in the OLS estimates is the risk of simultaneity in the models, because
insolvency risk can also affect securitization. Therefore, there is a risk of endogeneity in the models,
which may render the OLS estimators biased and inefficient.
         In order to reduce the risk of endogeneity in regressions, this study also makes use of a more
robust analysis with the use of exogenous instruments based on the Generalized Moment Method
(GMM). In short, this method has the advantage of estimating consistent parameters even in the case of
endogeneity of the explanatory variables and in the presence of measurement errors (Bond, Hoeffler and
Temple, 2001). In particular, Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) suggest the
addition of momentary conditions. As a result, System GMM (S-GMM) combines moment conditions for
the model in first differences with moment conditions for the model in levels.10
         According to Wooldridge (2002), in order to achieve a more efficient GMM estimator than the
OLS, there must be some restriction on the instrumental variables. To validate the effectiveness of the
instruments used in the GMM models, as suggested by Arellano (2003), we perform the Sargan test (J-
statistic) to verify if the overidentification restrictions on the moment conditions are valid. In addition, in
order to obtain robust standard errors, we apply White’s covariance matrix consistent with
heteroscedasticity. Furthermore, as proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991), we also perform the serial

  See Calomiris and Mason (2004), Jiangli and Pritsker (2008), Krainer and Laderman (2014), and Beck et al. (2016).
9
   We use MM-estimation type, which takes into account the presence of outliers in both the dependent variable and the
independent variables.
10
   We also use other variables present in the banking literature as instruments: indebtedness (ND), return on assets (ROA) and
total assets (proxy for the size of financial institutions).
                                                              5
correlation test of first (AR (1)) and second (AR (2)). Finally, in order to avoid the excessive use of
instruments in the models that may bias the result of the regressions, the ratio between the number of
instruments and the number of cross sections is less than 1.

4. Data
         In order to obtain the necessary information for the construction of a panel data set (quarterly
frequency) to analyze the effect of securitization on risk in Brazil, we use two main sources: Brazilian
Securities Commission (CVM) and Central Bank of Brazil (CBB). The construction of the database
comprises four steps. The first step is to identify the issuances of Credit Rights Investment Funds (FIDC)
and Real Estate Receivables Certificates (CRI) from the public offerings made available by the CVM.11
From these aggregated data it is possible to obtain information related to each issuance, such as: the
issuance date and the financial institution that originated the transaction. This information is fundamental
for the construction of the securitization variable, because it allows identifying the financial institution
that uses these financial products (FIDC or CRI) and in what period (quarter) this start. We do not
consider operations that have more than one originator. For the analysis period (January 2003 to
December 2016), 578 securitization operations were identified, 141 of which correspond to FIDC
issuances and 437 CRI issuances, originated by 52 financial institutions (32 banks that issued FIDC and
20 securitizers that issued CRI).
         In order to prevent a possible selection bias, the second step consists in a construction of a
counterfactual by identifying other financial institutions with similar size to those that issued FIDC or
CRI. In this step, the accounting data provided by the BCB are used for the banks, while the data related
to the securitizers (financial institutions responsible for the issuance of CRI) are made available by the
CVM.12 In the Balance Sheet, in line with other studies, the “total assets” account is used as proxy for the
size of financial institutions.13 Taking as reference the interval that corresponds to the minimum and
maximum value of the total assets, we identified the other financial institutions that make up the sample,
but did not issue FIDC and/or CRI in the period. Therefore, in addition to the previous sample
(institutions that carried out securitization operations), 40 financial institutions were identified (28
institutions that did not issue FIDC and 12 that did not issue CRI).
         From the total sample (92 financial institutions), the third step is to obtain economic indicators
based on the balance sheets collected in the previous step.14 These accounting data are important because
they allow the elaboration of indicators that reflect the economic-financial situation of financial
institutions. Insolvency risk (RISK), measured by the z-score variable, captures the probability of
insolvency by financial institution, and it is computed as:
                    𝑅𝑂𝐴𝐴𝑖,𝑡 +𝐸𝐴𝑖,𝑡
 (5) 𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑅𝑂𝐴𝐴)             ,
                               𝑖,𝑡


where, ROAAi,t denotes the return on average assets of the financial institution i in the quarter t, EAi,t it
represents the ratio of equity to total assets, and (ROAA)i,t is the standard deviation of the returns on
average assets that is calculated by means of a rolling window for 12 quarters (see, for example, Nicolo,
Jalal, and Boyd, 2006; Michalak and Uhde, 2012; Bertay, Dermirgüç-Kunt, Huizinga, 2013; Beck et al.,
2016; and Chen et al., 2017).15 In addition to RISK, based on accounting variables, we also calculated:
capitalization (CAP = Equity/Total Assets, see Aysun and Hepp, 2011; and Ben Salah and Fedhila, 2012),

   All the primary and secondary public offers registered or exempted from registration by the CVM are available for
consultation at the Systems Center (sistemas.cvm.gov.br).
12
   The balance sheet data of the securitizers are extracted from the External Disclosure System (DIVEXT), made available by
the CVM for the download of accounting reports, such as: Quarterly Information (ITR) and Standardized Financial Statements
(DFP).
13
   For examples of studies that use total assets as proxy for the size of financial institutions, see: Bonfim (2009), Kara,
Marqués-Ibanez, Ongena (2011), Kashian and Tao (2014), and Le, Narayanan, and Vo (2016).
14
   All the accounting data obtained from the balance sheets of financial institutions were deflated by the Extended National
Consumer Price Index (IPCA – official price index).
15
   In order to eliminate the bias caused by outliers, we considered only the observations in which their values are within the
difference between the mean and twice their standard deviation.
                                                              6
liquidity (LIQ = Liquid Assets/Total Assets Ratio – see Hollander and Prokop, 2015; and López-Andión,
2015), and profitability (ROE = Net Income/Shareholder’s Equity Ratio - see Jiangli and Pritsker, 2008;
and Berger and Bouwman, 2013).
        The fourth step consists in obtaining data on macroeconomic variables used in the literature on
securitization and risks that are available from CBB. These variables are the change in the monetary
policy interest rate (SELIC), the gross domestic product (GDP – growth rate), and the change in the
exchange rate (ΔEX - US dollar/Brazil Real).
        Table A.1 describes all variables and data sources which are used for building a balanced panel
with quarterly frequency. Table A.2 summarizes the descriptive statistics for the full sample, FIDC, and
CRI. In general, we observe that the mean of CR in CRI sample (0.4545) is greater than that for the full
sample (0.3702) and for the FIDC sample (0.3104).
        Based on the period from 2003 to 2016, Table A.3 shows the correlation between securitization
and insolvency risk. The negative correlation between RISK and SEC suggests that the higher the
securitization, the greater is the insolvency risk. In other words, an increase in securitization reduces the
z-score and therefore increases the likelihood of bank insolvency. The result for the consolidated
securitization market, which aggregates FIDC and CRI, presents a slightly greater correlation (-0.17) than
observed for FIDC and CRI samples (correlation of -0.15 for both cases).


5. Empirical results
        This section presents the results of estimations regarding the relationship between asset
securitization and insolvency risk in the Brazilian financial market. We perform several data panel
regressions through fixed effects method (FOLS), Robust Least Squares (MQR) method, and Systemic
Generalized Moments Method (S-GMM).16 In order to consider the characteristics of securitization in
Brazil, the first part of this section presents the results regarding the three models proposed for the
Brazilian securitization market, which encompasses the two main securitization products in Brazil: Credit
Rights Investment Funds (FIDC) and Certificates of Real Estate Receivables (CRI). The following two
subsections, present the results of the same models for two different samples (FIDC and CRI). In the last
subsection, we present the results for the model, which includes the macroeconomic variables.

5.1. Securitization and risk: evidence from FIDC and CRI
        Table 1 presents the results of the impact of securitization on insolvency risk. Based on the data
described in section 4, model 1 includes liquidity (LIQ) as a control (financial) variable, model 2
considers the profitability of financial institutions as control (ROE), and model 3 takes into account both
variables (LIQ and ROE). We present the results in two steps. The first presents the results of regressions
through FOLS, MQR, and S-GMM methods. The second, from the estimated coefficients, we observe the
impact of shocks on the variables used in the model on the insolvency risk.
        The results regarding the adjusted coefficients of determination and F-statistics in FOLS models
indicate that the regressors are relevant to explain the insolvency risk. Regarding S-GMM models, the
results show that all models accept the null hypothesis of the Sargan tests (J-Statistic) and, therefore, the
overidentification restrictions are valid. In addition, AR(1) and AR(2) tests do not indicate the presence of
serial autocorrelation in the models.
        It is observed that, regardless of the model and the method used, all estimated coefficients on
securitization are negative and have statistical significance (see table 1). This result is in line with the
literature that presents empirical evidence on an increase in the risk of financial institutions associated
with securitization operations. According to this view, financial institutions do not use securitization as a
financial instrument to transfer part of their risk, but rather to increase their liquidity. As a consequence,
financial institutions that originate securitization operations hold risky assets in their balance sheets which

     List of instruments used in GMM estimations are in table A.3 (appendix).
                                                                7
in turn increase their insolvency risk (see Dionne and Harchaoui, 2003; Franke and Krahnen, 2005;
Haensel and Krahnen, 2007; Le, Narayanan, and Vo, 2016; Chen et al., 2017).
         The risk retention can also be a result of credit enhancement mechanisms by originating financial
institutions. Credit enhancement mechanisms may include contractual (explicit recourse) and non-
contractual (implicit recourse) agreements (see, Calomiris and Mason, 2004; Vermileya, Webb, and Kish,
2008; and Casu et al., 2011). Among contractual agreements, the subordination of quotas by the
originating financial institution is a mechanism widely used in Brazil.
         Capital is important in bank risk-taking by financial institutions (Calomiris and Mason, 2004,
Berger and Bouwman, 2013, Lambert, Noth, Schüwer, 2017). According to Ashcraft (2008) capitalization
of the bank affects the amount of nonperforming loans it can absorb before harming its creditors. The
positive and significant coefficient on the capitalization ratio (CAP) indicates a decrease in risk. On the
other hand, liquidity and profitability are pointed out in the literature as decisive factors in the
securitization of assets by banks. Taking into account the S-GMM method as benchmark because it
permits to control the possible endogeneity in the models, we observe that both coefficients on liquidity
(LIQ) and on profitability (ROE) have negative sign and statistical significance. Regarding the negative
effect of liquidity on risk, this observation is in consonance with the idea that securitization provides an
additional funding source for the originator (see, Loutskina and Strahan, 2009). The negative coefficient
on the ROE is associated with the trade-off between risk and return. Bannier and Hänsel (2008) note that
the search for increased profitability is an important factor for securitization of assets by banks.

5.2. Securitization and risk: evidence from FIDC
        Taking into account only the FIDC sample, the same models presented in the previous section for
the total sample (FIDC and CRI) are re-estimated. In line with the results for the consolidated
securitization market in Brazil, regardless of the model and method used, all coefficients on securitization
are negative and significant. This result may indicate that securitization, through the issuance of FIDC,
increases risk. This evidence is consistent with the argument that financial institutions prefer to hold
worse-quality assets in their balance sheets and to securitize better-quality assets. The coefficient on
capitalization ratio is positive and may indicate that securitization, by allowing the transfer of part of the
risk, reduces regulatory capital requirements. The coefficients on liquidity and profitability are negative
and significant (S-GMM method), which it turn indicates that an increase in these variables may lead to
an increase in the risk.

5.3. Securitization and credit risk: evidence from CRI
         Table 3 presents the results of the impact of the securitization on the risk regarding the market of
Real Estate Receivables Certificates (CRI). In Brazil, this type of securitization has as underlying assets,
exclusively, real estate receivables (mainly those derived from real estate financing and rental
agreements). Using CRI sample, the same models considered in the previous subsections are re-estimated.
The findings are similar to those observed for the consolidated securitization market in Brazil and for the
FIDC market. Regardless of the model and method, all coefficients on securitization are negative and
statistically significant, which can indicate that securitization, through the issuance of CRI, increases the
risk. On the other hand, the coefficient on capitalization is positive and significant in all models.
Moreover, the coefficients on liquidity and profitability are negative and significant in S-GMM models,
and thus there is evidence that an increase in these variables implies an increase in the risk.

5.4. Robustness analysis
        Although the financial situation of banking firms plays a central role in explaining risk,
macroeconomic conditions are also important in explaining the probability of insolvency over time
(Bonfim, 2009). As a consequence, this section includes macroeconomic variables in the model as a way
of considering economic factors to explain insolvency risk. Thus, the benchmark model (equation 5) is
extended to: (6)         𝑅𝐼𝑆𝐾𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜂𝑖 + 𝛼4 𝑆𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽7 𝐶𝐴𝑃𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽8 𝐿𝐼𝑄𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽9 𝑅𝑂𝐸𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽10 𝛥𝑆𝐸𝐿𝐼𝐶𝑖,𝑡 +
                  𝛽11 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛥𝐸𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 ,
where, ΔSELIC (change in the monetary policy interest rate), GDP (GDP growth rate), ΔEX (change in
the exchange rate).
        Based on the studies on securitization and banking risk (see, for example, Casu et al., 2011;
Kashian and Tao, 2014; and Le, Narayanan, and VO, 2016), the macroeconomic control variables
(ΔSELIC, GDP and ΔEX) are included in the model. It is important to note that in addition to the
coefficient on securitization being negative and significant in all models and methods, the results
regarding the coefficients on the banking control variables do not differ from those observed in the
previous subsections (see table 4). In relation to the macroeconomic variables, we observe that the
coefficient on the monetary policy interest rate (SELIC) is positive and significant for almost all models
and, therefore, an increase in this variable can reduce the risk. In other words, an increase in SELIC can
lead financial institutions to a conservative position, which in turn can imply a decrease in the risk. The
coefficient on GDP is positive and significant in most models. This result is in line with the idea that in
periods of economic growth banks have better results and a lower probability of insolvency (see, Kashian
and Tao, 2014). In a different way from the previous coefficients on macroeconomic control variables,
the coefficient on EX is negative. Thus, currency devaluations may lead to an increase in the risk. In
particular, financial institutions that have liabilities exposed to currency risk are subject to a deterioration
in the quality of their credit portfolio.

6. Concluding remarks
        The empirical evidence from a representative sample of the securitization market in Brazil
indicates that financial institutions do not use securitization as a tool to transfer part of their risk. The
increase in the insolvency risk can be explained by the fact that financial institutions securitize better-
quality assets and to hold lower-quality assets. The results from the consolidated securitization market,
which encompasses both Credit Rights Investment Funds (FIDC) and Real Estate Receivables
Certificates (CRI), are confirmed by the individual analysis of each of these segments of securitization in
Brazil. Furthermore, the introduction of macroeconomic variables in the models also confirms that
securitization has a positive impact on the bank risk.
        In summary, regardless of the differences in securitization vehicles, this financial product seems to
increase the risk of financial institutions that originate these operations in Brazil. Based on the 2008
international financial crisis and its consequences, these findings reinforce concerns about
macroprudential measures for the sustainable development of the securitization market in emerging
economies.
