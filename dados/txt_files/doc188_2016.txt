Resumo: Por meio de uma função lucro quadrática normalizada estimou-se o efeito marginal (preço-
sombra) da associação a cooperativas no lucro agropecuário das regiões Sul e Sudeste brasileiras. Tais
regiões são responsáveis por mais de 50% da produção agropecuária brasileira e possuem uma média de
24% dos estabelecimentos rurais associados a cooperativas. Foram utilizados milho, soja, cana-de-açúcar
e leite, como produtos, combustíveis e trabalho contratado, como insumos variáveis e associação a
cooperativas, trabalho familiar e área irrigada, como insumos fixos. Os dados foram obtidos a partir do
Censo Agropecuário de 2006. Com base nos resultados preliminares, observou-se um efeito positivo da
associação de estabelecimentos agropecuários as cooperativas no lucro, para as regiões Sul e Sudeste.
Adicionalmente, foi encontrado um efeito positivo da associação a cooperativas na oferta de produtos e
demanda por insumos, indicando que, embora este fator fixo tenha elevado a oferta dos produtos
analisados, também intensificou a utilização dos insumos variáveis.

Abstract: A quadratic normalized restricted profit function was used to estimate the marginal effect of
co-ops (shadow price) on agricultural profit of the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. These regions
are responsible for more than 50% of Brazilian production and the government has implemented several
public policies aiming to improve production management of co-ops, which correspond to 24% of
producers in this region. We considered corn, soybean, sugarcane and milk as variable outputs, hired
labor and fuel as variable inputs, and co-ops membership, family labor and irrigated area as quasi-fixed
inputs for the Agricultural Census of 2006. Overall, the preliminary results suggest a positive effect of
co-ops membership on agricultural profits for the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. Additionally, a
positive effect of co-ops membership on commodity supply and on input demand was found, which
suggest that although it increases supply of these commodities it also intensify the use of variable inputs.
Key-words: Cooperatives, Agriculture, Restricted profit function.

1. INTRODUCTION

    The South and Southeast regions of Brazil are divided into seven states that in 2009 represented 53%
of the Brazilian Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The states of Minas Gerais (27%), Rio
Grande do Sul (22%), and Sao Paulo (17%) represented 67% of the South and Southeast regions’
agricultural GDP (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics – IBGE, 2009). Climate and soil
characteristics in these regions yield higher productivity in some commodities such as coffee, rice, and
sugarcane if compared to other regions. The most important agricultural commodities in these regions
are corn, soybean, sugarcane and milk, which represents more than 65% of agricultural production value
in these regions (IBGE, 2009).
    In addition to technology inputs some farmers have been participating in co-ops aiming to increase
their profits, given that a primary objective of a co-op is to increase the prices paid to members (Sexton
and Iskow, 1988). According to IBGE (2006), in the South region of Brazil co-op participation is higher,
around 32% of producers, than in the Southeast region, 18% of producers, and the Brazilian average of
14% of producers. Their participation increases with farm size, achieving 39% of farms with more than
1000 hectares in the South region (IBGE, 2009). Agricultural co-ops were responsible for 340 thousand
direct jobs and 6% of Brazilian GDP in 2013 and half of Brazilian agricultural production, according to
the Brazilian Cooperative Organization (OCB, 2014).
    A few studies have analyzed the influence of co-ops on prices, production, and how they affect the
profitability of its members: United States (McNamara et al., 2001; Folsom, 2003; Jardine et al., 2014),
Mexico (Milford, 2004); Italy (Cazzuffi, 2013) and Ethiopia (Bernard, 2008; Rodrigo, 2012). These
studies used different public policies methodologies but, overall, they have found a positive effect of co-
op membership on members’ profitability. We propose an alternative methodology to evaluate the effect
of co-ops on Brazilian agricultural profitability. A static short-run profit maximization behavior is
modeled to identify how members’ participation on co-ops affects their profits.
    A similar approach, which uses a restricted profit function, has been used in the literature to evaluate
the impact of different factors (i.e. quasi-fixed capital) on agricultural profit and commodities supply
such as in Disch (1983), Flores (1984), Fulginiti and Perrin (1990), Huffman et al. (2002), Huffman and
Evenson (2006; 1989), and Schuring et al. (2011). For instance, a few studies have used this theoretical
framework to evaluate the effect of education, research, and rural extension (similar to technical
assistance) in Brazil but have not paid attention to the importance of co-ops on agricultural performance.
    In this paper we propose to investigate the effect of being associated with a co-op in the South and
Southeast regions of Brazil using a quadratic normalized restricted profit function to estimate the
marginal effect of co-ops on profit (i.e. shadow price). In addition, we seek to identify the effect of co-
ops in each commodity supply and input demand. For the South and Southeast regions of Brazil the
restricted profit function was modeled using corn, soybean, sugarcane and milk5 as variable outputs,
labor and fuel as variable inputs, and co-ops, family labor, and irrigated area as quasi-fixed inputs. This
paper contributes to the literature by applying a different theoretical framework to evaluate the co-ops
effect on agricultural profits. The outcome of this approach can be used by policy makers to develop and
evaluate policies related to co-ops.
    Overall, the preliminary results suggest a positive effect of co-ops6 on agricultural profits for the South
and Southeast regions of Brazil, although a few municipalities (less than 3% of the region) presented a
negative effect. Participation in co-ops had higher positive impact in the south in comparison to the
southeast, where specific agricultural characteristics play an important role on this result. In addition, a
5
  It represents 71% of both south and southeast regions production value. These products represent 68% of what is produced
in the South and 75% of what is produced in Southeast regions of Brazil.

  In this paper, Co-ops are measured as the share of producers that belong to a co-op in a municipality. Thus, it ranges from 0
to 1 where 0 means that none of the producers is a member of a co-op, and 1 represents when all producers are members. The
average for the region is 0.24.

                                                                                                                             2
significant positive effect of co-ops on commodity supply (i.e. supply elasticity of corn with respect to
co-ops is 0.27) and on input demand (i.e. demand elasticity of fuel with respect to co-ops is 0.08) was
found, which suggest that even though a co-op membership increases supply of these commodities it also
intensify the use of inputs, as expected.
   The remainder of this study is divided in five sections, section 2 presents a brief description of co-ops
in the Brazilian agricultural sector, section 3 illustrates the theoretical framework adopted, section 4
provides data description and empirical specification, section 5 discusses the results, and section 6
provides a brief conclusion of our study.

2. CO-OPS IN BRAZIL

    According to Helmberger and Hoss (1968), the objective of a co-op is to provide stability and optimal
production growth conditions for its members, which can be seen in rural credit co-ops, marketing co-
ops, and input sellers. Several studies on organizational economics explain the existence of co-ops due
to their ability to a) engendering economies of scale; b) access new markets, including international
markets; c) reduce costs through vertical integration; d) reduce risks in joint actions; e) access and adopt
new technologies and inputs via technical assistance and services; and, f) enable members to develop
bargaining power for better prices (Bonus, 1986; Sexton, 1986; Staatz, 1987; Hansmann, 1988, 1996;
Sexton; Iskow, 1988; Bialoskorski Neto, 2000; Valentinov, 2007).
    In Brazil, agricultural co-ops were used by the government during the 1970s and 1980s as instruments
to implement public policies for the rural sector. These policies aimed to provide technical assistance
and better market access, among others objectives. At the end of the 1980s and during the 1990s, co-ops
lost its importance as channel of public policies implementation, which resulted in a downfall of many
of them and a traumatic process for many of their members (Presno, 2001; Bialoskorski Neto, 2005). It
is important to notice that those were the most acute years for the co-ops due to a crisis that disrupted the
Brazilian economy and agriculture.
    During the 2000s, the government carried on programs that facilitated co-ops to make investments,
implement managerial improvements, and overcome its weakened financial situation. Nowadays,
although the Brazilian government has been neglecting the co-ops as a base for policy implementation,
they have been used to strengthen the market relation within agents.
    The co-ops linked to the agricultural sector in Brazil are considered a distinguished branch among
co-ops, which have an important role on the agri-food chain coordination. In addition, Cechin (2014)
highlights the importance of these co-ops in the dissemination of new technologies on crop plantation,
harvesting and post-harvest processes in Brazil by spreading more effectively the information to
members, in comparison to a group of farmers that are not associated.
    Figure 1 illustrates the recovering period of the agricultural co-op membership after the sharp fall in
2004, when a commodity price crisis disrupted the Brazilian agricultural market and caused an overall
increase on farms and co-ops liabilities. After retaking the growth path, the number of co-ops remained
fairly stable with a slight increase in the number of members, which already exceeded 1 million farmers
in 2013.

   In Brazil, several commodities reach the market through co-ops, including 74% of wheat production,
57% of soybeans, 48% of coffee, 44% of cotton, and 43% of corn (OCB 2011; 2013; 2014). In addition,
Chaddad (2011) suggest an increase in co-op participation on milk production (from 20% to 40%) in
Brazil, although a decline on its production has been observed. Also, a higher percentage of pesticide
(76%) and fertilizer (65%) use is observed among farmer members of co-ops, in comparison with non-
members, despite the decline observed in recent decades, which illustrates the adoption of technology
inputs among members (IBGE, 2009).

3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

    There is a widespread literature on shadow price estimation from a restricted profit function. The latter
function represents the profit in the short run where some of the inputs have little or zero mobility during
a short period, which implies time and cost to adjust (Huffman; Evenson, 1989), named quasi-fixed
inputs. The effect of these inputs on the profit can be interpreted as a shadow value or price. In this paper,
we modeled cooperative as a quasi-fixed input in a restricted profit function since it affects commodity
production as an input but it is not flexible (i.e. labor) as it given some conditions that the farmer have to
be fulfill to become a member. Several papers have used this approach to evaluate public policies and
research and development impacts such as Shumway (1988), Huffman and Evenson (1989), Fulginiti;
Perrin (1990) and Schuring et al. (2011). As mentioned before, this approach will also permit to evaluate
the impact for being associate on commodities supply and input demands.
    According with Lau (1976), a multi-output and multi-input production can be represented considering
!" , # = 0, 1, … , ) + +, as vector of inputs and outputs. A normalize output is represented by !, , outputs
by !" > 0 , # = 0, 1, … , ), where ) represents outputs, and for + inputs !" < 0, # = ) + 1, … , ) + +.
The quasi-fixed factors such co-ops are represented by /0 , where /0 ≥ 0, 2 = 1, … , 3.
    The transformation curve associated to the multi-output and multi-input described is a function of all
these variables 4 !, , !5 , … , !6 , !675 , … , !678 ; /5 , … , /; = 0. Under perfect competition on output and
input markets and a technology that satisfy monotonicity and convexity, a normalized restricted profit
function is < = 4 =5 , … , =6 , =675 , … , =678 ; /5 , … , /; where =" = >" >, , >, represents the price of the
normalize output !, , and >" is the nominal price of each other input and output !" , # = 1, … , ) + +.

function is homogeneous of degree one with respect to prices (which is imposed by dividing by one of
the prices), non-decreasing in output prices and non-increasing in input prices (monotonicity in inputs
and outputs), symmetric (which is also imposed in the estimation), and is convexity in prices (second
order derivatives matrix is positive semidefinite).
   We assume that all farms are profit maximizers on a perfect competition structure, so the supply curve
and input demand can be recover by envelope theorem using the first derivative (which by the
monotonicity property will have the following sign)

4. DATA AND EMPIRICAL MODEL
   4.1.Data

    The data used in this study was provided by IBGE and it refers to the Brazilian Agricultural Census
of 2006, which was the last year the agricultural census was carried out. It comprehends (it was
implemented) the period of January 1 to December 31 of 2006 (IBGE, 2009). We did not have access to
farm level data. In order to address the key issues of this research, we use municipal scale data which
totalizing 2130 observations (1074 in the South and 1056 in the Southeast of Brazil). This number of
observations consists of an exclusion of the 0.5% smallest and 0.5% largest observations in order to
remove potential outliers. Similar to Helfand et al. 2015, assuming data aggregation implies that we
assume homogeneity within each aggregate observation. Table 1 displays an overall average and standard
deviation of each variable used in estimation, for the whole sample.

Outputs:
   We defined the outputs to use in our model based on the total value of production of crops and
livestock products. Four outputs were chosen: soybean, milk, sugarcane and corn; which represented
71% of the agricultural gross value of production (GVP) in the South and Southeast of Brazil in 2006.
Figure A1, in the appendix, illustrates the spatial distribution of these outputs.

- Labor: the average wage (price) of hired workers was calculated by the ratio of annual expenditure and
hired worker’s unit. In the Agricultural Census (2006), the latter measure is estimated in as a weighted
measure that take into account differences between adult males, women and children. Thus, the estimated
average wage (price of hand-labor factor) take into account these differences.
- Fuel: it is the sum in tons of alcohol, charcoal, gas (LPG), gasoline, and diesel. They were converted to
tons considering the information about density contained in conversion table available in Petrobras
(2015). Thus, fuel prices were calculated by dividing the monetary expenditure declared by the amount
of fuel used in tons.
Fixed Factors:
- Irrigated area: it is considered as irrigation the practice of applying water, not rain, directly on the
surface of the soil under pasture or crops, in certain quantities and intervals. The cost of implementation
and its maintenance is not available in the Agricultural Census 2006, thus area irrigated was considered
as a quasi-fixed input.
- Family labor: similar to the hired labor, tis variables includes rural landowners and their relatives. The
Agricultural Census also calculates a weighted measure to account for differences in the labor with
respect to adult male, female and child as the hired labor. It has been considered as a quasi-fixed input
since we assume that does not adjust in the sort-run and difficulties related to the measurement of its
monetary value.
- Cooperatives: it was considered as an input given its ability to influence production. This variable was
defined as quasi-fixed input for three reasons. First, it might be necessary to incur in costs to become a
member. Second, an absence of a monetary value prevents of using it as a variable input. Third, the
existence of pre-establish contracts on commodity supply imposes a restriction on the flexibility of the
membership.
   Given we did not have access to farm level data, the cooperatives variable was built as the percentage
of farmers that answered "yes" to the question "are you a member of a cooperative?". On average, 24%
of our sample answered yes to this question. This values ranges from zero to one, and has a higher average
for the South (32%) than for the Southeast (18%) region of Brazil.
   Figure 2 illustrates the geographical distribution of the proportion of cooperatives’ members by
municipality in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. States where agriculture has a larger role in
economy and more socio-economic more developed this variable shows higher values. For example, in
the Southeast region the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais (mid-west of this region) play an important
role in the region while in the west region of the South, which relies heavier on agriculture (in all three
states - Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina).

      1.1.Empirical Estimation

    Several paper have used of a restricted profit function when considering multi-input and multi-output
technology such as Shumway et al. (1988), Huffman and Evenson (1989) and Schuring et al. (2011). For
more details about this approach, see Lau (1976) and Nadiri (1982). Three functional forms are usually
employed for restricted profit functions: transcendental logarithm (translog), quadratic normalized and
generalized Leontief7. Chambers et al. (2013) indicated that the quadratic normalized is superior than the
other using a Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, we use a quadratic normalized restricted profit function
to represent the farms of South and Southeast of Brazil, as Schuring et al. (2011) also used

using corn, soybean, sugarcane and milk8 as variable outputs, labor and fuel as variable inputs, and co-
ops, family labor and irrigated area as quasi-fixed inputs. The normalized restricted profit represented in
equation (7) is homogenous of degree one in prices. The commodity supply and input demand

which can be interpreted as the normalized shadow price and found as the first derivative of the restricted
profit function with respect to it (Lau, 1976; McKay et al., 1983; Huffman; Evenson, 1989):

the normalized shadow price of being associated to a cooperative can be interpreted as the monetary

[equation (7)], the supply of corn, milk, sugarcane and soybean, and the demand of fuel [equations (8)]
was in the system. Hired labor price was used as normalizer price and did not have an equation to be

estimated9. Overall10, the estimation presented a good fit. Most of the coefficients were statistical
significant (around 70% of the coefficients were significant at 10%), monotonicity11 was satisfied in at
least 90% of the observations within outputs/inputs directly estimated in the system of equation.
    The elasticities sign also proves how well the theoretical framework fits the data. Most of the own-
price elasticities, on average, have shown the correct sign but we opted to present them as the average of
the observations that satisfied monotonicity. The own-price elasticities and cross-price elasticities were
estimated using equation (10) and (11), respectively, and the results are displayed in Table 3. All own
price elasticities are correctly signed, where output supply shows a positive elasticity and input demand
a negative sign but no statistical significant. Own price elasticity of soybean, milk, and hired labor are
statistical significant at 1%. An increase of 10% on soybean price would lead to an increase of its supply
by 1.7%. Castro (2008) when estimating a profit function for Brazil (not per municipality, which is more
aggregated) found a significant own-price elasticity for soybean of 0.57. Figueiredo (2002) did not found
a consistent result for soybean since the own-price elasticity was not statistical significant and negative.
    On the other hand, milk has a much higher impact. An increase of 10% on its price would lead to an
increase of 4.3% on its supply. Figueiredo (2002) also found a negative own-price elasticity for this
output, which it is inconsistent with the theory, when considering his overall result. All other own-price
elasticity is not statistical significant, except for hired labor. For this input, we found that an increase on
the wage of 11% would lead to a decrease on its demand averaging on 4.8%. Two factors might be behind
this high value. Labor was used as the normalized price and we also use family labor as a quasi-fixed
input. Figueiredo (2002) also found a negative value but much lower, -0.34, while Disch (1983) found -
0.42. On the other hand, Castro (2008) found a negative own-price elasticity for this input, around -2.96.
    Table 3 also displays the substitution or complementarity between outputs and inputs. Overall, the
sign of these cross-price elasticity corroborates what was found in the literature and what we expected.
We found a complementary relationship between soybean and corn as Castro (2008) found, but not a
significant number.
    As expected, the price of inputs increase as the supply of soybean decreases, where labor prices have
a higher effect than fuel prices. An increase of 10% on fuel prices would lead to a reduction of 6% on
soybean supply. Figueiredo (2002) also found a negative effect of labor on soybean supply, of around -
1.59, which is quite similar to what we found (-1.07). Castro (2008) and Disch (1983)12 also found a
negative effect but lower. Milk supply also present similar effect, but with an even higher impact of hired
labor, which might be due to the fact it is a labor intensive activity. It is interesting to point out that the
elasticity of sugarcane with respect to fuel price is positive (but not significant), which shows the
importance of fuel prices on this output production. A significant and negative effect of hired labor is
found.
    In short, we also found that corn, milk, and sugarcane are complementary, suggesting that an increase
in price of one of these products would lead to an increase in output for these same products. Figueiredo
(2002) also found complementarity between milk and corn. We have also found that an increase on
supply prices of corn and milk and demand prices of labor would lead to a decrease on demand for fuel.
This suggests that labor and fuel are complementary.

   Monotonicity property was satisfied in 93% of the observations for soybean (positive output supply), 99% of the
observations for milk, 99% of the observations for sugarcane, 100% of the observations for corn, and 100% of the observations
for fuel demand (negative demand). For the numeraire, hired labor demand, this result was lower, only 33% of the observations
satisfied it.

    As pointed out in the empirical section, we did not estimate a full quadratic and interacted all quasi-
fixed inputs with the prices of inputs/outputs13. Thus, in the next section we identify the normalized
shadow price of co-op membership by evaluating the equation (13), where is the only quasi-fixed input
interacted with the normalized prices.

            2.1.Cooperative membership effect on commodities supply and Profit

    Based on the equation (14) we estimated the elasticity of supply with respect to co-op membership.
The higher effect was on soybean, which displayed a positive elasticity of 0.98 while corn, milk and
sugarcane displayed an elasticity of 0.05, 0.34, 0.27, respectively. Only the sugarcane elasticity with
respect to co-op membership was not significant. A positive elasticity was also found for the inputs,
suggesting that as the number of member farms increase more inputs are used in their production
(municipalities).
    Overall, calculation of equation (13) based on the parameters estimated suggested a positive effect
of cooperative membership on profits. Figure 3 displays the histogram of the marginal effect estimated
for each region. On average, the normalized shadow price was of R$ 2697.40, which in US$ of 200614
is around US$ 1243.04. Since it is based on the parameter, we were able to estimate the statistical
significance. On average, it was statistical significant at 5%., which corroborates our hypothesis that co-
op membership affects positively the profits, at least for this two Brazilian regions. The average for each
region was US$ 1307.76 for the South and US$ 1198.65 for the Southeast, both statistical significant.

   We did not interact for several reasons. One of them is to build a more robust model without higher effect of multicollinearity
(given the number of interactions).

Although the bulk of the distribution is around the average (and median) several observations
(municipalities) present higher normalized shadow prices in both regions. This result can be better
illustrated in a map, as shown on Figure 4.
    The effect of co-op membership on profit varies according to the characteristics of the agricultural
activities of each municipality and region, in this case the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. As
shown in Figure A1 (in the appendix), milk production is clustered in the state of Minas Gerais (situated
in the Southeast of Brazil) and in the northwest of the South region of Brazil. This is the reason behind
the large number of dairy co-ops in this region, such as ITAMBÉ (in Minas Gerais) and
CASTROLANDA (in Paraná). On the other hand, soybean is mainly produced in the South, where co-
ops as COCAMAR (in Paraná) and AGRÁRIA (in Rio Grande do Sul), export and process this output.
The South also produces corn, which it is processed and marketed by co-ops such as COAMO (in
Paraná), and COOPERALFA (in Santa Catarina). Sugarcane is more concentrated in São Paulo, where
large co-ops operate directly linked to industrial plants that produce anhydrous alcohol (i.e.
COPLACANA and COOPERSUCAR), although much of the production of sugarcane is allocated for
own-capital firms, what may explain why the effect of sugarcane co-op membership was not significant.
     There is a predominance of corn and soybean production where the effect of co-ops is higher in the
South region. On the other hand, higher effects in the Southeast are in large associated with regions where
milk and sugarcane production are higher, in addition to soybean production in the west of this region.
This result suggests an association between the regions where the effect is higher and where the main
outputs of each region are produced by analyzing Figure 4 with Figure A1.
     Therefore, the co-op membership effect on agricultural profit found in this paper indicates the
relevance of co-ops not only in municipalities with high number of members, which will be illustrated in
Figure 5. This outcome strongly encourages public policies that incentive c membership in rural areas.
Although the effects of it in the west of the South region and in the central-western portion of the
Southeast region, where traditionally there is a strong presence of the cooperatives, were smaller than
the average of the region, they are still positive and important to stimulate farm income.
     Given our specification we can obtain the minimum/maximum co-op membership (share of famers
as members) given the other variables that achieve the higher marginal impact on the profit. Using the
equation (13), to estimate the normalized shadow price, we plugged median values for all normalized
prices (for each region) and let the co-op membership (represented by a quasi-fixed input – z4) vary. The
outcome of this analysis is displayed in Figure 5. Given that the linear term of z4 is positive and the
quadratic term is negative, the curve presents a point of maximum. For the whole region this value was
0.66 while for the South and Southeast regions was 0.98 and 0.7, respectively. These values rely heavily
on the price used to estimate them. We opted to graph the marginal effect of co-op membership but the
graph could have also been done for the level equation (restricted profit function).
    As expected, the South of Brazil have shown a higher maximum point given the region characteristics
– higher share of co-ops’ members, as shown in the data section. This result suggests that any increase
in the share of farmers that are members higher than 0.70, for the southeast, would lead to positive
increments on the profits but at a decreasing rate. In reality, only less than 3% of the municipalities have
a share higher than 0.70 in the Southeast while for the South of Brazil this range [0.70] represents 7.5%
of the sample. Thus, the government should focus on municipalities (or activities in specific
municipalities) that have share of farmers that are members smaller than 0.7, since its effect on profit
after this threshold decreases. For the region, considering its maximum point, only 5.6% of the sample
has a share of farmers that are members higher than the maximum point, 0.66.

3. CONCLUSION

    This paper provides some preliminary empirical evidence about the role of co-ops in the Brazilian
South and Southeast regions. These regions’ main agricultural outputs are sugarcane, soybean, corn, and
milk, which are the commodities considered in our restricted profit function estimation. These regions
are also known for the importance of co-ops for the agriculture sector. We presented new estimates of
output supply and input demand elasticities for selected crops and inputs that are both consistent with the
theory and the market. Overall, supply of soybean and milk are more price sensitive than sugarcane and
corn.
    Adjustments to the fixed factor co-op membership are shown to shift the output and input demand
functions. A higher co-op membership rate increases the supply of soybean, corn, and milk. We have
also found a positive effect on input demands of labor and fuel, suggesting that farmers become more
capital and labor intensive when they are members of co-ops. In addition, we found a positive effect in
farmers’ profit due to co-op membership, with higher impact in the South region. Thus, the outcome of
our estimation corroborates our hypothesis that co-op membership affects profits positively.
    Our results can be of use for government evaluation of the importance of co-ops and as a starting
point to build policies related to co-ops. Although it is an ongoing research, our preliminary results
matched the agriculture reality and reflected the importance of co-ops to this sector. A second step on
understanding this issue is a farm level analyzes, which is our main goal. We expect a more rigorous and
robust analysis to be achieved, then better policy resolutions could be drawn from it.
