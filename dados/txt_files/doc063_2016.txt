This study relates to the literature on the communication and clarity of the policymakers. The
novelty concerns the investigation of the effect of the communication and clarity of the fiscal
authority on market expectations on public debt. The article addresses empirical evidence, based
on the Brazilian experience, regarding the idea that communication is essential for the coordination
between the policymaker and the market participants in order to lead expectations. The findings
suggest that the communications from the Brazilian National Treasury concerning fiscal policy
represent an important tool to improve the effects of the management of the public debt on market
expectations regarding public debt.

1. Introduction

        According to International Federal of Accounts, fiscal transparency is one of the main
pillars of governance in the public sector (IFAC, 2011). In general, fiscal transparency increases
the society’s confidence in the fiscal management and, as a result, implies better fiscal decisions.
As pointed out by IMF (http://www.fsb.org/2014/10/cos_070620/), fiscal transparency is critical
for effective management and accountability. In this framework, information is essential because
a bad quality of information leads to wrong interpretation by users thus causing innapropriate
decisions. In brief, governamental transparency is an essential element in the implementation of
fiscal policy (Bolívar, Galera, Muñoz, 2015).
        The analysis regarding the relevance of communication as a tool for managing expectations
is well known in the study of monetary policy.1 As suggested by Guthrie and Wright (2000) several
central banks make use of statements as policy instrument (open mouth operation). However, as
pointed out by Jansen (2011), regular central bank communication in a nonaccessible manner is
not sufficient to assure transparency. Hence, only a correct combination between transparency and
communication would reduce the uncertainty on central bank’s preferences, thereby improving
private sector expectations. In short, clarity on communication is essential for the coordination
between the policymaker and market participants as a way of diminishing asymmetric information.
        Such as observed by Bolívar, Galera, Muñoz (2015), government financial sustainability
can be affected by the level of understandability of information transparency. Therefore, based on
the argument that sound private expectations on public debt sustainability is a precondition for the
success of fiscal policies and that the readability of communications is potentially an important tool
to drive expectations, we analyze the impact of communications and its quality on market
expectations.
        Statements may be considered as a coordination tool.2 However, the success of a fiscal
authority’s communication for driving private expectations depends on the credibility of the
statements (Eusepi and Preston, 2011). As pointed out by de Mendonça and Machado (2013), fiscal
credibility is essential to stabilize expectations in order to mitigate the risk of insolvency. Fearful
markets constrain the actions of fiscal authorities, thus it is crucial to manage expectations in order

to convince markets that fiscal policies are sustainable (Karantounias, 2013).
       Due to the fact that clarity is necessary to lessen difficulty of the private sector in
interpreting the fiscal authority’s message, such as in Jansen (2011), this paper focuses on
readability. To illustrate how this works in practice, we provide an empirical analysis based on the
Brazilian experience. The largest Latin American economy, in order to control the dynamic of
public debt, adopted a strategy for lengthening and improving the composition of the domestic
federal public debt since November 1999. Furthermore, as an important tool of communication
between the policymaker and the private sector, the Brazilian National Treasury issues several daily
releases (official notes of the Ministry of Finance) regarding fiscal policy. Hence, Brazil is a good
laboratory to observe if the fiscal authority’s communication improves the private expectations on
public debt.
       The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the indices of
communication and clarity regarding the Brazilian fiscal authority. Section 3 presents the
methodology and data used in the study. Section 4 provides empirical evidence, through an
econometric analysis, of the effect of communication and clarity on the public debt expectations
and their volatility. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Fiscal indices of communication and clarity

       The analysis on how communication of the fiscal authority affects private expectations is
directly connected with the success of the announced strategy in the conduct of fiscal policy. In the
case where the information available for the private sector is sufficient to make correct forecasts,
there is no surprise on the dynamic of public debt. As pointed out by Missale, Giavazzi, and
Benigno (2002), the reduction of asymmetric information diminishes the risk of refinancing the
debt and thus it increases the expectation of the success of the fiscal policy. Therefore, the search
for a sound fiscal policy which avoids the default risk depends on the combination of the correct
strategy for managing public debt with the communication of next actions of the policymaker.
       In order to measure the communication of fiscal authority we built an index taking into
account the number of releases through official notes available from the website of Ministry of
Finance (www.fazenda.gov.br). The index proposed in this paper uses a discrete and positive
numerical scale in order that each release takes value equal +1. In a way of eliminating unnecessary
information, we consider only releases concerning actions of fiscal policy. Therefore, regarding
                                                  3
                   content, for example, calls for contests are discarded. We aggregate the result per day and based
                   on this we create a series that identifies the number of communications with monthly frequency.
                   Figure 1a shows the behavior of the communication index (COM) over time. As we can see, the
                   number of communications increased considerably between 2002 and 2011. It is noteworthy to
                   observe that the top of the trend is the period 2009 to 2012 and it is a clear reflex of the subprime
                   crisis.

                              It is possible that only the amount of the information available would not be sufficient to
                   capture the real effect from the communication on expectations. As a consequence, it is also
                                                                                                                      4
necessary to consider indicators that can capture the quality of information. Since clarity is essential
for transparency and the communications are made in written releases, readability is a key piece in
this framework. We cannot assure, in the case of a text that is difficult to read, the content is
understood. Hence, the idea of “open mouth operation” could be ineffective. In order to consider
readability measures in the analysis, such as indicated by Jansen (2011), two well-known indices
are used. The first is the Flesch reading ease score. According to Flesch (1948) a higher number of
syllables per word, or a higher number of words per sentence, decreases the readability of a text.
Based on this idea the Flesch reading ease score (F) is a result of:
(1)     F = 206.835 − 1.015 × (words/sentences) − 84.6 × (syllables/words),
Where: F > 70 denotes a very easy text to read and F < 30 indicates a very difficult text to read.
        In order to use the above-mentioned index, we take into consideration all releases of the
Treasury regarding fiscal policy in each month. If the month under evaluation does not present a
communication on fiscal policy we use the average of the results observed in the previous 12
months. Figure 1b presents the performance of Flesch reading ease score over time. There is no
doubt that the releases from the Brazilian Treasury are not easy to read. Practically all time of the
time the score is lower than 30, but there is a trend of this difficulty in reading is decreasing over
time.
        As pointed out by Jansen (2011) one drawback with the previous index is the scale because
the interpretation is not clear for the interval between 30 and 70 (30 < F < 70). In order of surpassing
this problem, Kincaid et al. (1975) included the number of years of education needed to
comprehend a text. Therefore, although the Flesch-Kincaid grade level also considers the same
core measures that are used in Flesch reading easy score (word length and sentence length), it has
different weighting factors. As a consequence, the interpretation of this index is different from the
previous because a greater score denotes a decrease in clarity (greater number of years of education
needed to comprehend the text), and thus the results of the two tests correlate approximately
inversely. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level is calculated as follows:
(2)     FK = 0.39 × (words/sentences) + 11.8 × (syllables/words) − 15.59.
        Figure 1c shows the Flesch-Kincaid grade level along time. In general, it is possible to see
that there is an improvement over time. In other words, the trend reveals the clarity on fiscal
communication is increasing.

3. Methodology and data


       Limited to the availability of the information from the National Treasury, the period under
analysis is from November of 2002 to September of 2014. Therefore, it is a period under inflation
targeting (adopted in June of 1999) and after the implementation of a strategy for managing public
debt with the objective of extending the average maturity and improving the public debt
composition.
       In a general way, the literature on public debt management presents, as a rule of thumb for
improving the performance of fiscal policy, the increase in the average maturity and the partial
indexation of the public debt.3 Following these recommendations, the Brazilian National Treasury
has adopted two main guidelines after 2001 (de Mendonça and Machado, 2013): (i) replaces bonds
indexed to the interest rate and indexed to the BRL/dollar exchange rate with fixed rate bonds and
inflation-linked bonds; and (ii) increases the average maturity of the public debt in order to reduce
the refinancing risk. Therefore, the two main channels regarding the management of the public debt
are: the channel of the indexation profile and the channel of the average maturity.
       There is no doubt that most of the time there is a trend of increase in the average maturity
of the public debt (figure 2) which, in turn, denotes a concern of the fiscal authority with this
strategy of improving public debt management. In relation to the indexation of the public debt, we
create an index to simplify the interpretation. Since, in general, increases in fixed rate bonds
(FIX_B) and inflation-linked bonds (INF_B) represent improvements in public debt profile,
whereas increases in bonds indexed to the interest rate (INT_B) and indexed to the BRL/dollar
exchange rate (EX_B) indicate a deterioration of the public debt profile, the index is a result of the
difference between these parts. Therefore, the index is calculated as:
(3)    INDEX = (FIX_B + INF_B) – (INT_B + EX_B).
       The interpretation of the INDEX is straightforward. When the INDEX is positive, it denotes
a good quality of the indexation profile. On the other hand, when the INDEX is negative, it
represents deterioration in the public debt profile. Figure 2 shows that in the second semester of
2006 the INDEX became positive and there is a trend toward improvement.

                                 Taking into account the relevance of the indexation profile and the average maturity of the
                    public debt and with the purpose of providing empirical evidence regarding the effect that
                    communication and its clarity have on market expectations regarding public debt, we consider the
                    following baseline models:4
                    (4)          Et(DEBTt+12) = 0 + 1DEBTt-1 + 2INDEXt-1 + 3(INDEX x Z)t-1 + εt, and
                    (5)          Et(DEBTt+12) = β0 + β1DEBTt-1 + β2AMDt-1 + β3(AMD x Z)t-1 + ζt,
                    where: t, ζt ~ N(0,2);Et(DEBTt+12) - market expectations regarding public debt to GDP ratio for
                    the next 12 months;5 DEBT - is the public debt to GDP ratio; INDEX - measures the quality of the
                    public debt indexation (indexation profile) – trend (Hodrick-Prescott filter); AMD – is the average
                    maturity of the public debt (in months); Z – is a vector of explanatory variables regarding
                    communication of fiscal policy and its clarity (COM , F, and FK); INDEX x Z – is an interaction
                    term between the indexation profile and the change of the communication/clarity of the fiscal
                    policy; and AMD x Z – is an interaction term that is the average maturity of the public debt and the
                    change of the communication/clarity of the fiscal policy.
                                 The interaction terms in the equations above allow us to observe whether an increase in
                    communication or in clarity would be able to amplify the effect of the effort of the fiscal authority
                    to improve the indexation profile and to extend the average maturity on market expectations
                    regarding public debt/GDP ratio. For example, considering equation 4 (the channel of the

indexation profile), the effect of an improvement due to COM and F is given by α2+α3 < α2, while
FK implies α2+α3 > α2. The channel of the average maturity retains the same idea for the
coefficients β2 and β3.
        As pointed out by Blinder et al. (2008) skillful communications can raise the signal-to-noise
ratio and reduce financial market volatility. The basic idea is that when central bankers
communicate clearly, financial markets have less difficulty in interpreting the information and thus
there is less uncertainty (Jansen, 2011). Based on this idea we can analyze if the communication of
the fiscal authority is sufficiently clear to affect the volatility in expectations of public debt. In
short, the idea is straightforward, clarity from the fiscal authority can lead to less uncertainty, which
implies lower volatility. Therefore, with the intention to analyze the effect from the communication
and the clarity on the volatility of the public debt expectations we rewrite equations (4) and (5) as:
(6)     t[Et(DEBTt+12)] = 4 + 5DEBTt-1 + 6INDEXt-1 + 7(INDEX x Z)t-1 + t, and
(7)     t[Et(DEBTt+12)] = β4 + β5DEBTt-1 + β6AMDt-1 + β7(AMD x Z)t-1 + ϛt,
where: t, ϛt ~ N(0,2); t[Et(DEBTt+12)] is the standard deviation of rolling window of twelve

        In order to estimate the equations 4 to 7 we use two methods: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The choice of these methods is because they allow
one to see in a simple manner the statistical significance and the sign of each coefficient on each
variable in the model. Therefore they represent a straightforward framework to observe the impact
caused by communication and clarity.
        Although OLS models are useful for our objective, in general, the main reason for the use
of GMM in this study is due to the combination of the problem of heteroskedasticity, which is
common in macroeconomic time series, with the possible risk of endogeneity captured by the
expectations. As pointed out by Wooldridge (2001), in order to consider a more efficient GMM
estimator than OLS, overriding restrictions need to be considered. Therefore, the J-statistic is
presented for each model as a test of over-identifying moment conditions. Furthermore, besides the
one-step estimations, we make estimations for two-step GMM estimators using Windmeijer (2005)
correction to address small-sample downward biases on standard errors.6

                     In general, from the channel of indexation profile, there are strong indications that
             communication and clarity of the fiscal authority are relevant to reduce expectation on the public
             debt level (see table 1). In relation to the effect of the communication (INDEX x COM) on the
             expectation of public debt, the findings (coefficients are negative and significant) confirm the
             assumption that an increase in the communication amplifies the effect of an improvement in the
             public debt profile. Concerning the effect of clarity on expectations of public debt the result also
             confirms the benefits. The coefficients on both indices (INDEX X F and INDEX X FK) have
             statistical significance and present signs in agreement with the theoretical perspective.

                     The estimations from the channel of the average maturity (table 2) indicate that only
            communication seems to be relevant for decreasing public debt expectations. In contrast to what is
            observed for the indexation profile, although the coefficients regarding clarity on the average
            maturity also suggest a decrease in public debt expectations, they are not significant. It is important
            to note that although the increase in public debt maturity is part of good practices for public debt
            management, this cannot be true in the case of developing economies like Brazil. Such as pointed
            out by de Mendonça and Machado (2012), it is possible that for implementing this strategy the
            government needs to pay high interest rates which in turn implies an increase in the service of the
            public debt. In brief, the non-significant effect of clarity can be a result of this channel not being
            sufficiently relevant for public debt expectations (coefficients on AMD in the models 2 and 3 are
            not significant).

                     Regarding the results concerning volatility of the public debt expectations (see tables 3 and
            4), it is observed that only in the case of the channel of the indexation profile is the effect caused
            from the communication of the fiscal authority relevant. In fact, the significant and positive
            coefficients on communication indicate that the expectations react to the releases from the National
            Treasury regarding fiscal policy. However, no model through the channels of indexation profile
            and average maturity of the public debt presented statistical significance in relation to the effect of
            the clarity on the volatility of the expectations. This result suggests that although the
            communications from the fiscal authority can affect the volatility of the expectations, clarity of
            these communications are not sufficient strongly to reduce the volatility.

             4.1. Different horizons for the expectations of the public debt


                     Since communication and clarity, especially through the channel of indexation profile, are
             relevant to decrease public debt expectations for the next 12 months, we extend our analysis
             providing new empirical evidence based on an increased horizon (24 months and 36 months ahead).
             In general, the expectations on the public debt present a downward trend along the period and the
             longer expectations are lower than shorter expectations (see figure 5).

       The main idea is to observe the power of communication and clarity in affecting longer
horizons. With this intention, we perform this analysis taking into account the models that
presented statistical significance for the effect of the communication/clarity on expectations in the
previous section (see tables 1 to 4). Hence, the models selected are: (i) channel of the indexation
profile: (public debt expectations – table 1) – models 1, 2, and 3; (volatility of the expectations –
table 3) – model 1); and (ii) channel of the average maturity: (public debt expectations – table 2):
model 1. The results are presented in table 5.
       Such as observed in the previous section, the results suggest that communication and the
clarity of the fiscal authority amplify the power of an improvement of the indexation profile on
public debt expectations (see table 5). In other words, communication and clarity represent a tool,
through the channel of the indexation profile, which is able to affect public debt expectations for
different horizons.
       Regarding the effect of the communication on the volatility of the public debt expectations
with longer horizons, the results show that, independent of the horizon in consideration, the
communication provokes a reaction in the volatility of the expectations for both channels of the
indexation profile and of the average maturity (see tables 6 and 7). Therefore, it is an additional
evidence that the market takes into account the information released by the government and that
this information is used for building forecasts with different horizons.

4.2. Robustness analysis


        In order to check the previous results regarding the effects caused by communication and
clarity from the fiscal authority on public debt expectations, a VAR was used. In this framework
the variables are considered endogenous: E(DEBT), COM, F, and FK. As usual, the analysis of a
VAR is based on impulse response functions because they allow one to see the impulse on
expectations of the public debt caused by shocks (or innovations) provoked by residual variables
over time (Sims, 1980). As a manner of eliminating the problem of the ordering of variables in the
VAR, the generalized impulse response function was selected in the decomposition method.7
        Figure 4 shows the results of the generalized impulse-response functions and are plotted for
12 months after the shock. The results denote that communication from fiscal authority may imply
a decrease in expectations of public debt which persists over time. It is important to remember that
an increase in F means an increase in the clarity while an increase in FK means a decrease in the
clarity. Therefore, the results observed from both indices in the impulse-response graphs are in
agreement with the idea that an increase in the clarity of the fiscal authority (that is, an increase in
F or a decrease in FK) helps to reduce the expectations of an increase in the public debt.
        In other words, independent of the horizon used for the expectations of public debt in the
analysis (h=12 months, h=24 months, and h=36 months) the results indicate that an unexpected
positive shock transmitted from communication and clarity implies a decrease in expectations of
public debt which remains over time. In brief, the results from VAR confirm the previous empirical
evidence that communication and clarity are important tools to guide expectations of public debt.

 Based on Schwarz and Hannan-Quinn criteria, the VAR order is 4. In addition, all roots have modulus less than one
and lie inside the unit circle. All tests are available upon request to the authors.

5. Conclusion

        Nowadays, several international agencies (e.g. IMF, World Bank, IFAC) consider
transparency and, in particular, information that is more understandable, as essential for the
implementation with success of the fiscal policy. This paper amplifies the analysis on traditional
tools used by government regarding fiscal transparency making use of a direct channel of
government with citizens, that is, the information that is released by internet through official
notes. In particular, we evaluate if this information is, in fact, understood by the market. The
main result is that communication and clarity of the fiscal authority are relevant to lead
expectations on public debt to a lower level.
        Based on the communications through official notes from the Brazilian Ministry of
Finance regarding fiscal policy, we investigate their effects on the public debt expectations and
their volatility. With this purpose we considered the number of releases as a proxy of the
communication and the quality of these releases from two readability measures (Flesch and
Flesch-Kincaid) as proxies for the clarity of the fiscal authority. Taking into account the two
main channels of the public debt management (indexation profile and average maturity) we
analyzed the effect of communication and clarity on expectations (and volatility).
        The results of the estimations indicate that although there exists statistical significance
of the coefficients on communication in the case of the average maturity channel, the main
channel in which communication and clarity can affect the public debt expectations is the
indexation profile. Focusing on this channel we observe that both communication (number of
releases) and clarity (quality of the information) are relevant to decrease the expectations of an
increase in the public debt. Regarding the volatility of the expectations, although the
coefficients on communication present statistical significance and thus indicate that the
expectations react to the releases of the fiscal authority, we did not find evidence that the clarity
is relevant to decrease the volatility of the public debt expectations.
        In short, the results in this paper indicate that the communications from the Brazilian
National Treasury concerning fiscal policy represent an important tool to improve the effects
of the management of the public debt on market expectations regarding public debt. Therefore
the search for an improvement in the communication of the fiscal authority (e.g., increasing
clarity) to lead public debt expectations cannot be neglected. Moral of the story: when the
government opens its mouth is necessary that it be careful with its words.
