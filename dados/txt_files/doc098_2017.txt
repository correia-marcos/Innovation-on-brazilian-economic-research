Abstract
In 2013, 7.32 percent of the Brazilian population, or almost 15 million people, declared
that they had some form of disability that limited their mental and/or physical capabilities
to some extent. Disabilities affect the labor market both from the supply side and the
demand side. Disabilities reduce the labor supply by limiting disabled individuals’
transportation options, increasing their transportation costs, and quite simply, reducing
their incentive to work. From the labor demand perspective, employers may hesitate to
hire the disabled or pay them commensurately with the unimpaired because of a
perception that the disability will reduce productivity and increase costs, or their
reluctance may be due to indefensible discrimination. Based on empirical evidence, this
study sought to answer the following questions: Are people with disabilities paid less in
the Brazilian labor market? If so, is this predominantly due to differences in individual
socioeconomic characteristics, lower productivity, or is it a case of discrimination? The
wage gap analysis was performed by gender and by the severity of the disability’s affect
on job performance. Using DeLeire’s (2001) methodology, the effects of discrimination
and productivity were isolated in the analysis. It was found that the wage gap between
disabled and unimpaired men is caused by both the discrimination effect and the
productivity effect. In the case of women, the observed productivity effect was of greater
magnitude than for men, with discrimination being found only among the group of women
whose deficiency severely hindered the performance of activities. As an implication for
public policies, we reaffirm the importance of the 2015 Brazilian Persons with Disabilities
Statute.

Resumo
Em 2013, 7,32% da população brasileira, ou quase 15 milhões de pessoas, declararam
possuir alguma deficiência que limita a sua capacidade física e/ou mental. No que tange
o mercado de trabalho, a deficiência afeta tanto o lado da oferta quanto da demanda. No
caso da oferta, um exemplo disso seria a dificuldade de locomoção, que eleva os custos
de transporte e reduz o incentivo ao trabalho. Pela ótica da demanda, os empregadores
podem hesitar em contratar deficientes ou pagá-los de modo igualitário aos demais, dada
a possibilidade de percepção de que a deficiência reduz a produtividade, aumenta os
custos de adaptação do ambiente de trabalho ou, simplesmente, por existir a
discriminação para com esses indivíduos. A partir da obtenção de evidências empíricas,

este estudo procurou responder as seguintes questões: pessoas com deficiência
auferem menores ganhos no mercado de trabalho brasileiro do que as pessoas sem
deficiência? Em caso afirmativo, isso ocorre predominantemente devido às diferenças
socioeconômicas individuais, menor produtividade ou discriminação? A análise da
diferença salarial foi realizada por gênero e pela gravidade do impacto da deficiência no
desempenho do trabalho. Para isolar os efeitos da discriminação e da produtividade, foi
utilizada a metodologia proposta por DeLeire (2001). Como resultados, verificou-se que
o hiato salarial entre homens deficientes e não deficientes é causado tanto pelo efeito
discriminação quanto produtividade. No caso das mulheres, o efeito produtividade foi
maior do que para os homens, mas a discriminação foi verificada apenas entre aquelas
mulheres que declararam que a deficiência afeta intensamente o desempenho das suas
atividades. Como uma implicação para políticas públicas, reafirmamos a importância do
Estatuto da Pessoa com Deficiência, sancionado em 2015.

   1. Introduction

        Prior to 1970, public policy makers' believed that people with disabilities (PWD)
should not work. This belief led to the disabled’s exclusion from the job market and the
application of public resources to subsidize their maintenance (Blanck, 2001).
        The lack of employment opportunities for disabled individuals was addressed by
the United Nations in 1981. The first legally binding treaty addressing the rights of the
disabled to labor market access was promulgated in 1983 by the United Nations’
International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment
Convention No. 159, which was ratified by 70 countries and put into force in 1985 (Lopes
2005; Fonseca, 2006).
        Based on the ILO agreement, Brazil adopted the Disabled Hiring Law in
Companies (Law No. 8,213 / 1991) as internal policy. This law established that companies
with 100 or more employees must to fill 2 to 5 percent of their positions with persons with
disabilities. The guarantee of employment access mandated by the Quota Law created
other issues, such as equal pay and opportunity for promotion.
        The right to equal treatment for PWDs in the labor market is recognized by a
number of countries (see American Disabilities Act 1990, Disability Discrimination Act
1995, UK Employment Initiative, 2000; European Union). In contrast, Brazil addressed
the problem of employment discrimination against the disabled only in 2015 with the
Person with Disabilities Statute (EPD - Law no. 13,416, July 6, 2015). Article 34 of the
EPD guarantees that "persons with disabilities are entitled, on an equal basis with other
persons, to just and favorable conditions of work, including equal remuneration for work
of equal value."
        In Brazil, 14.7 million individuals were reported as having at least one disability in
2013, representing 7.32 percent of the population. Of these, almost 13 million have only
one deficiency: 8.7 percent have only an intellectual disability; 15.7 percent have only a
physical disability; 21.9 percent have only a hearing disability; and 54.7 percent have only
a visual disability (National Health Survey – PNS, 2013). Of the total number of working-
age Brazilian people with one disability, only 41.4 percent are economically active,
whereas this figure is 63.6 percent for the unimpaired members of society. Explanations
for this labor market participation discrepancy arise from multiple factors and can be
analyzed from the perspective of labor supply and demand.


                                                                                            2
        On the supply side, the lack of necessary facilities and infrastructure can make it
more costly for people with disabilities to attend to the demands of employment (Gottlieb,
Myhill & Blanck, 2010). The dearth of public and/or private environments set-up for people
with disabilities limits access to various goods and services, especially transportation
services, putting them at a significant disadvantage. In addition, depending on the type,
severity and onset of the disability, this group may have lower levels of qualification and
require more flexible jobs to fit their treatment regime (Gottlieb et al., 2010).
        On the demand side, many organizations are reluctant to absorb this category of
worker (Ribeiro & Carneiro, 2009), possibly due to the perception of lower productivity
and the cost of adapting the work environment1 (Garcia & Maia, 2014; Jones, 2008), or
the fear stigmatization by fellow employees, which may lead to inter-office friction
(Gottlieb et al., 2010; Jones, 2008). Disability can limit the tasks that can be performed,
reduce work productivity and increase the costs of its execution (Gannon & Munley,
2009).
        Regarding earnings, a difference between the salaries received by disabled
workers and unimpaired workers may result from the disabled workers' limitations, their
possible unobservable characteristics, their performance, and as an effect of
discrimination.
        According to Becker (1957), discrimination can be defined as the wage gap
between equally productive individuals. Several studies have found the presence of the
discriminatory effect in the wage differential between individuals with and without a
disability in developed countries, such as Campolieti (2002) in Canada, Kidd, Sloane &
Ferko (2000) and Jones (2006) in the United Kingdom, Acemoglu & Angrist (2001) and
DeLeire (2001) in the United States, and Lechner & Vazquez-Alvares (2004) in Germany.
        The present research follows this theme but focuses on the Brazilian case.
Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions: Are people with disabilities paid
less than the unimpaired in the Brazilian labor market? If so, is this predominantly due to
differences in average individual socioeconomic characteristics, productive failings, or
discrimination? To answer these questions, we estimate earnings equations for disabled
and unimpaired workers and decompose the differential using the Heckman-corrected
Oaxaca-Blinder technique.
        The wage-gap analysis was performed separately by gender and by the severity
in which the disability affects activities. Other published studies have found that there are
significant wage differences between disabled men and women in the labor market. In
addition, wage differences are possibly related to the severity of disability (DeLeire, 2001).
        As a main contribution of our work on the Brazilian case, we were able to isolate
the effects of discrimination and productivity in the wage gap analysis using DeLeire’s
(2001) methodology. According to DeLeire (2001), the presence of a disability may
directly reduce a person's productivity and explain part of any wage gap between the
disabled and the unimpaired; however, when carrying out wage gap analyses, authors
generally assume that the entire difference between the disabled workers’ wage structure
and unimpaired workers’ wage structure is due to discrimination. DeLeire’s (2001)
conjecture was supported during our analysis of literature on wage differentiation in Brazil:
no empirical work was found that separated the effect of discrimination against the

represent significant costs to employers and may well lead to the provision of a suitable environment for
clients with disabilities. For more details, see Schartz, Hendricks & Blanck (2006) and Ethos Institute (2002).

disabled and the effect of lowered productivity by the disabled on wage structure
differentiation.
       Results from our study provide information that policy makers should find useful
when allocating resources to further public policy in regards to the disabled. For example,
the Quotas Law and the EPD presuppose that disabled individuals are discriminated
against in the labor market and therefore require assistance if they are to receive equal
treatment with the unimpaired when seeking employment and when being remunerated.
On the other hand, Brazil has established the Continuous Cash Benefit Program (BPC)
that unconditionally directs income to disabled individuals, tacitly assuming that the
disability prohibits gainful, productive employment.
       The data used in this study were provided by the 2013 Brazilian National Health
Survey (PNS), which is conducted throughout Brazil. The Survey data is the most current
available, but the data were gathered prior to implementation of the EPD. At that time,
there was no legislation to guarantee the disabled the right to employment on “an equal
basis with other persons, to just and favorable conditions of work, including equal
remuneration for work of equal value" (EPD).
       This study is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the materials and
methodology employed, addressing the adopted concepts and definitions, the data and
sample, and the modeling and empirical design; Section 3 presents and discusses the
results; and section 4 presents the final considerations.

   2. Methodology

      2.1.   Concepts and definitions

        This study compared two broad groups of individuals: those with disabilities and
those without. It is emphasized that the individuals’ responses to PNS survey questions
determined their group. The broad group of the disabled is comprised of individuals that
declared themselves to be impaired intellectually, physically, auditorily, or visually.
Individuals that declared that they had more than one disability were excluded from our
analysis. Table 1 shows the specific deficiencies that are considered in the disabled group
and are delineated according to PNS (2013) classifications.
        The two broad groups, disabled and unimpaired, were then subdivided by gender.
According to Jones (2008) and Baldwin & Johnson (2000) and Johnson & Favreault
(2001), the disability’s effect may be different between genders as the impacts of
particular limitations may be distinct: men’s labor may be more adversely affected by loss
of mobility and strength; women’s labor may depend more on sensory incapacity and
appearance.
        The severity of a disability in respect to an individual’s job activity is also an
important factor that, as noted by Garcia & Maia (2014), should account for the
differentiation in wages among the disabled. Therefore, we analyze the effect of a
disability on wages separately by grouping disabled individuals according to their
disability’s self-reported affect on their activities.

         The two gender specific groups of disabled were disaggregated into the following
sub-groups for analysis: men with disabilities whose disability greatly limits their activities
(Men-greatly); men with disabilities whose disability moderately limits their activities
(Men-moderately); men with disabilities whose deficiency limits their activities little (Men-
little); men with disabilities whose disabilities do not limit activities (Men-without limitation).
The group of disabled women was disaggregated into sub-groups in a manner identical
to the disaggregation of the disabled men’s group (Women-greatly, Women-moderately,
Women-little and Women-without limitation). The nomenclature in parentheses will be
used hereafter in the study.
         Individuals allocated among the groups were those who worked or interned for at
least one hour at some money-earning activity during the week of July 21-27, 2013 (the
research reference week). The income obtained by the individual refers to the gross
monthly income in Brazilian Reals (Brazilian currency) normally received from the
individual’s main job. The number of hours that an individual normally worked weekly at
that main job was used in the calculation of the gross income per hour of work, a variable
of interest in the research.

       2.2.    Empirical modeling and selected variables

       Earnings equations are understood as an attempt to empirically relate worker
earnings with the worker’s personal characteristics and the work’s characteristics
(Menezes-Filho, 2002). In Schultz’s (1961) and Becker’s (1962) pioneering articles on
Human Capital Theory the authors posit that an individual's salary can be expressed as
a function of their professional qualities represented by years of schooling, training, and
experience. In this context, Mincer (1974) proposed an equation that analyzes the
influence of education and experience on an individual’s salary, and is shown by eq. (1):

                              𝑙𝑛𝑌(𝑠, 𝑥) ≈ 𝛼0 + 𝜌𝑠 . 𝑠 + 𝛽0 𝑥 − 𝛽1 𝑥 2                          (1)



                                                                                                 5
        Equation 1 indicates that the neperian logarithm of earnings (𝑙𝑛𝑌) is linear in years
of formal education (𝑠) and linear and quadratic in years of job experience (𝑥), with 𝜌𝑠
being the constant rate of return from education (Heckman, 2006).
        It is important to note that estimating Mincer's equation using ordinary least
squares (OLS) leads to the problem of sample selectivity, a problem that may make the
OLS estimator inconsistent. A procedure developed by Heckman (1977) has emerged as
an alternative to correct selection bias between those who work and those who do not
work; this procedure is used in our study.
        According to Rezende & Wyllie (2006), this approach uses a two-stage procedure
that can be summarized as: i) a Probit model is estimated to determine the probability of
labor market participation; and from this model, one obtains the inverse Mills ratio (IMR);
ii) Using the IMR as an explanatory variable, the earnings equation is estimated by OLS
for the sample of occupied persons.
        In the first step, a probit probability model is used to estimate the likelihood that an
individual will participate in the labor market based on the individual’s observable
characteristics. The probability of individual (i) participating in the labor market, 𝑝(𝑌𝑖 = 1),
conditional on the values of the exogenous variables contained in 𝑥𝑗𝑖 , is given by equation
(2):

                          𝑝(𝑌𝑖 = 1|𝑥𝑗𝑖 ) = 𝑀(𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑥1𝑖 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑘 𝑥𝑘𝑖 )                     (2)

where M is the cumulative normal distribution function described by equation (3):
                                           𝑧
                                 𝑀(𝑧) = ∫−∞ 𝛿(𝑧)𝑑𝑧                                          (3)

and 𝛿(𝑧) represents the standard normal density.
        The dependent variable, 𝑌𝑖 , is binary and assumes a value of 1 if the individual
participated in the economically active population (PEA) during our survey’s reference
period, or 0 if the individual did not; 𝛽0 is the intercept term; 𝛽𝑗 (𝑗 = 1,2, … , 𝑘) are
coefficients to be estimated; and 𝑥𝑗𝑖 (𝑗 = 1,2, … 𝑘) is the vector composed of k explanatory
variables, which are the individual’s observable characteristics considered in the labor
market participation equation. The explanatory variables used for this first model are
those usually used in other published studies (Cunha, 2008; Oliveira, 2009; Pinto &
Cunha, 2014): level of schooling completed, age, race, domicile setting (urban or rural),
control dummy variable for metropolitan regions, geographic region and the individual's
role at the domicile. The results from the labor participation equations are available upon
request.
        Using labor market participation equation estimates, we then obtain the estimate
of the IMR (𝜆), which is defined as the inverse ratio of the probability of participation
predicted through equation (2). This variable is added as explanatory in the earnings
equation estimate to manage sample selection bias. To control for the complete range of
other factors that influence earnings other than those presented in Human Capital Theory
(education and work experience), additional independent variables are considered in our
earnings equation estimates.
        As the dependent variable, we use the neperian logarithm of the monthly wage per
hour worked from the main job, Lnwage. Table 2 presents the complete description of all
variables considered by the study’s empirical models.



                                                                                              6
        It is of note that this study also contains two variables not commonly used in
standard wage equations. The first of these is comprised of self-reported data regarding
the individual’s health (health). The health variable is assumed to be related to
productivity since health conditions can limit the type or amount of work a person can
perform (DeLeire, 2001). The second somewhat nonstandard variable captures the age
of disability onset (onset), which is divided into three subsets: individuals born with the
disability, those that acquired it in their youth (up to 18 years of age) and those that
acquired it as adults (18 years old and over).

      According to Jones (2008) and Baldwin & Johnson (2001), disability can be non-
permanent and can occur at any stage of life. Labor market issues faced by individuals
who have been disabled since childhood are distinct from those faced by individuals who
became disabled later in life, possibly after entering the labor market. According to Jones



                                                                                                     7
(2008), persons who are disabled during childhood may face discrimination both
educationally and upon entry into labor market. Persons who are disabled after ending
their education may also face discrimination when entering the workforce or when
returning to work after a debilitating illness. Although Jones (2008) affirms that it is rare
for cross-section studies to have information on the date of a disability’s onset, this
information is available in PNS’s microdata and was included in our study. The relevance
of this control was addressed by Pelkowski & Berger (2004), who found out that the
adverse effects of disability often depend on the individual’s age when struck by the
disability (Jones, 2008).
        After estimating the earnings equations, the earnings differential between the
groups is evaluated using the decomposition procedure developed by both Oaxaca
(1973) and Blinder (1973). This procedure starts by calculating the difference between
the two broad groups Lnwage (log of hourly wage) using results from the groups’
estimated earnings equations. It is important to note that the mean wage of each group
is that obtained by a linear forecast taken at the midpoint of the equation regressors
(Jann, 2008). This procedure is expressed by equation (4):

           𝐷 = 𝐸[𝑙𝑛𝑌𝑎 ] − 𝐸[𝑙𝑛𝑌𝑏 ] = 𝐸[𝑋𝑎′ 𝛽𝑎 + 𝑣] − 𝐸[𝑋𝑏′ 𝛽𝑏 + 𝑣] = 𝐸[𝑋𝑎 ]′ 𝛽𝑎 − 𝐸[𝑋𝑏 ]′ 𝛽𝑏 (4)

in which 𝐸(𝛽) = 𝛽 and 𝐸(𝑣) = 0. According to Jann (2008), equation (4) can be
reorganized according to equation (5), which is called "threefold” decomposition:

          𝐷 = [𝐸(𝑋𝑎 ) − 𝐸(𝑋𝑏 )]′. 𝛽𝑏 + 𝐸(𝑋𝑏 )′ . (𝛽𝑎 − 𝛽𝑏 ) + [𝐸(𝑋𝑎 ) − 𝐸(𝑋𝑏 )]′ . (𝛽𝑎 − 𝛽𝑏 )    (5)

       According to Jann (2008), this differential can be decomposed into two parts, the
"twofold decomposition." For this, it is necessary to assume that there exists some vector
of non-discriminatory coefficients, 𝛽 ∗ , so that equation (5) can be rewritten as shown in
equation (6):

                   𝐷 = [𝐸(𝑋𝑎 ) − 𝐸(𝑋𝑏 )]′. 𝛽 ∗ + 𝐸(𝑋𝑎 )′ . (𝛽𝑎 − 𝛽 ∗ ) + 𝐸(𝑋𝑏 )′ . (𝛽 ∗ − 𝛽𝑏 )   (6)

        Equation (6) is used in our study. According to this equation, the total differential
of the two groups of workers’ wages is divided into two components. The first component,
or the “explained effect” ([𝐸(𝑋𝑎 ) − 𝐸(𝑋𝑏 )]′. 𝛽 ∗ ), is the part of the differential that is
explained by the differences in the two groups’ average characteristics (productive and
personal attributes and other aspects derived from their labor market entry). The second
component, 𝐸(𝑋𝑎 )′ . (𝛽𝑎 − 𝛽 ∗ ) + 𝐸(𝑋𝑏 )′ . (𝛽 ∗ − 𝛽𝑏 ), refers to the part of the differential not
explained by these characteristics, the “unexplained effect.”
        As pointed out by Jann (2008), many published studies have attributed this
unexplained part of any wage differential to discrimination in the labor market. This is
probably due to difficulties when attempting to decompose the unexplained part of the
differential and data constraints regarding the specific job-related limitations caused by
the disability. However, the unexplained differential can easily arise due productive
heterogeneity rather than discrimination, especially in a case that assesses differences
between individuals with and without a disability, given potential limitations in the
execution of activities by those with disabilities. It is very important to note that the
unexplained wage difference component includes all wage differences caused
by unobserved variables.



                                                                                                  8
        The possible relevance of discrimination and productive heterogeneity when
determining the cause of any wage differential between individuals with and without a
disability necessitates the development of a strategy to properly control for these aspects
in the differential’s estimate. Our study follows a procedure proposed by DeLeire (2001)
that uses a group of disabled individuals who self-reported that their productivity was not
affected by their impairments, which allowed the separation of discriminatory effects on
earnings from productivity unobserved effects on earnings. The PNS microdata used in
our study contains self-reported answers to the question “to what extent does disability
limit your activities,” and the answers to this question made that comparison possible.
Assuming that the self-reported data is correct, any unexplained difference between the
wages of those who report that their disabilities do not limit their activities and the wages
of the unimpaired working at the same job is likely to be due to discrimination rather than
to the unobserved physiological effects of disability (DeLeire, 2001).
        Self-declaration may lead to some types of bias: the presence of financial incentive
programs for disabled persons may cause individuals to overreport their disability
(Kerkhofs & Lindeboom, 1999), or because the disabled are often socially stigmatized, a
disability may be underreported (Bound, 1989). There is no consensus regarding this
issue. In Brazil, the main financial incentive program directed toward disabled persons
(BPC) is not based on self-reported criteria.
        The procedure used on our study to ascribed wage differences between the
disabled and the unimpaired due to discrimination or unobserved productivity consists of
making two different comparisons, which is represented schematically in Figure 1. In
Comparison I, the two following groups are compared:
- Group 1: Unimpaired individuals
- Group 2: Individuals with disabilities that affect their performance at work a little,
moderately, or severely.
        According to DeLeire (2001), any unexplained difference between groups 1 and 2
is likely to be due to the effects of both unobserved effect of physical state and
discrimination.
        The second comparison, Comparison 2, is between groups 1 and 3:
- Group 1: Unimpaired individuals
- Group 3: Individuals with disabilities that do not interfere in performance at work.
        Any unexplained difference in wages between individuals from groups 1 and 3 is
likely due to discrimination (DeLeire, 2001).

       The disabled whose disability affects their work may demonstrate lower
productivity and face discrimination. Considering the results from comparisons I and II,
measurement of how much of the unexplained wage difference can be attributed to
discrimination and how much can be attributed to unobserved productivity effects caused
by the disability becomes essential.

       2.3    Data and sample
       This study incorporates microdata from the 2013 National Health Survey (PNS)
prepared by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and contracted to
the Ministry of Health. The 2013 PNS survey is the most current available and provided
information regarding the health status and lifestyles of 205,546 individuals and 63
thousand households within Brazilian territory. The health status data specified
individuals with chronic diseases and disabilities. The survey also includes demographic
and socioeconomic statistics.
       The PNS sample included 13,569 Brazilians who reported a disability (6.65% of
the entire sample). Of these, 1,499 (10.97% of the disabled) were excluded from our
analysis because they declared that they had more than one disability. This was done
because only one disability is sufficient to identify discrimination, if it exists.
       The study considered a sub-sample drawn from PNS data of people between 18
and 60 years of age who do not attend school. Of the 81,802 individuals that made up
this sub-sample, 5.99 percent (4.9 thousand individuals) declared themselves to have
only one disability, and 45.2 percent of them were economically active (2,240 individuals).
Of those disabled, economically active individuals, 64.64 percent are visually impaired,
19.73 percent are hearing impaired, 13.79 percent are otherwise physically disabled and
1.83 percent are intellectually disabled. The remaining individuals in the sub-sample were
unimpaired, and 67.9 percent of them were economically active.
       Among the disabled, economically active population (EAP) in the study’s sub-
sample, 54.69 percent are men and 45.31 percent are women. The effect of the sub-
sample’s disabled EAP’s disability on their activity is similar between men and women
with 53.6 percent reporting that the disability does not interfere with their economic


                                                                                         10
activities, 25 percent reporting that the disability impairs the activity only a little, 12.7
percent reporting that the disability moderately affects the activity, and 8.6 percent
reporting that the disability greatly disrupts their economic activities.
        Table 3 contains main average observable characteristics (and its standard
deviations) of the groups being compared: the unimpaired and those whose disability
does not interfere, interferes only a little, interferes moderately, and interferes strongly in
activities.
        The data in Table 3 show that the proportion of individuals who declare a very good
health condition is significantly higher for the non-disabled and for the disabled whose
disability does not affect their activities than it is for those in the other disabled categories.
At the other health extremes, the proportion of individuals who report a poor or very poor
health condition is much higher for those whose disability limits their activities to some
extent than for those in other categories. For the unimpaired and for those whose
disability does not affect activity, the proportion of self-statements from those whose
health condition is poor and very poor is similar and lower than for those who have a
disability that affects activity.
        Regarding the types of disability in the considered sample, visual disability
predominates in all subcategories of the disabled. There are also a relatively higher
proportion of people with physical disabilities in the categories disability “moderately
affects” and disability “greatly affects.”
        Regarding education levels, we emphasize that the distribution of individuals
among these levels is similar for the unimpaired and for the disabled whose disability
does not affect activities. On the other hand, there is greater percentage of individuals
with only basic schooling and lower percentage of individuals with college education
(completed or in progress) among those with disabilities that limit activities to some extent
than among individuals in the “unimpaired” and the disabled “does not affect” categories.
        It is also verified that, among the disabled people whose disability does not affect
activities, there is a greater proportion of white individuals and individuals with an urban
residence when compared with the other groups. Still, this group (disabled people whose
disability does not affect activities) contains the largest proportion of people with jobs in
the public sector: 24 percent of that group’s individuals are in that employment category.
As for geographical aspects, a relatively high percentage of individuals in the disability
“does not affect” activities group reside in Brazil’s South region. There are also a relative
high percentage of people in the groups with disabilities that moderately or greatly affect
their activities living in Brazil’s Northeast region, the country’s most underdeveloped
region. Less developed regions usually contain a higher proportion of disabled people
because of adverse living conditions that hamper the development of children and the
treatment of disabilities and diseases that can generate disabilities.

       Table 4 presents the results of Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for men and Table
6 the results for women. The results shown in Table 4 indicate that the wage differential
is much higher for those men whose disability affects their activities moderately or greatly
than it is for men in the other disability groups. For the Men-moderately group, the
predicted log wage difference compared to the unimpaired is 0.368, approximately a 44.5
percent difference2. The predicted hourly wage for this group (Men-moderately) is R$
4.80, and R$ 6.93 for the unimpaired.

       For the Men-greatly disabled group, the predicted log wage difference compared
to the unimpaired is 0.389, or approximately a 47.6 percent difference. The predicted
hourly wage for the Men-greatly group is R$ 4.70. For the Men-little group, the predicted
log wage difference compared to the Unimpaired group is 0.118, approximately a 12.5
percent difference, with a predicted hourly wage of R$ 6.16.
       These wage differentials are higher than those found by Garcia & Maia (2014)
when studying the wage gap in Brazil. These authors pointed out a differential of 33
percent between employees with a severe disability and unimpaired employees and a
differential of 11 percent between employees with functional limitations only and

  As Hertz et al. (2008), our wage data information are all in natural logarithms. So, the percentage
differences are approximations for the log point differences. According to the authors, differences of 40 log
points or less are reasonably close approximations of standard arithmetic percentage differences.

unimpaired employees. Their study did not disaggregate by gender. The 2006 study by
Contreras et al. of the wage gap between the disabled and the unimpaired found that the
differential was 8.5 percent in Chile and 32 percent in Uruguay. This study was male
gender specific. In addition, it did not disaggregate populations by the severity of the
disability, which made it difficult to compare their results with our results.
        Finally, the predicted mean hourly wage of the Men-without limitation group is
R$7.79, 11.1 percent higher than the predicted mean hourly wage of the Unimpaired
group.
        An analysis of column M4 of Table 4 shows that in 2013 the percentage wage
difference was negatively influenced by the “explained effect” (of -24.5 percentage
points). That is, if the average observable characteristics of the disabled Men-without
work limitation group were equal to those of the Unimpaired group, the first group’s
average wage per hour of work would fall to R$ 6.10 per hour, a reduction of 1.96 R$/hour,
which indicates that observable characteristics are more positive among this disabled
group than for the unimpaired. Similarly, if the average observable characteristics of the
unimpaired were equal to those of the disabled Men-without limitation group, the salary
earned by the unimpaired would increase to R$ 8.62 per hour.
        Why, then, is the average wage of the Men-without limitation group not R$ 8.62?
Because there is an effect that is not explained by observable characteristics that reduces
their salary by 0.83 R$/hour, to a predicted R$ 7.79 per hour. The differential of 0.83
R$/hour is equal to 12.7 percentage points of their wage, which according to the
hypotheses adopted in this study is caused by discrimination, since the groups being
compared (Men-without limitation and Unimpaired) are equally productive3.
        Assuming that the discrimination effect does not change according to the degree
of disability and in order to understand how much of the unexplained wage differentials
observed in columns (M1), (M2) and (M3) are due to discrimination and how much are
due to unobserved productive heterogeneity, DeLeire (2001) suggests that the
unexplained effect should be disaggregated in each comparison because people with
both functional and work limitations may be both less productive as a result of their health
condition and face discrimination.
        These results of this type of disaggregation are shown in Table 5, which presents
the summary of the wage differential decomposition among its components: observable
average characteristics (including self-declared health-state), discrimination and the
unobserved productivity effect.

Note: This Table should be analyzed together with Table 4 to infer about the statistical
significance of the effects.

3 As DeLeire (2001), we reaffirm that it is assumed here that those individuals who have declared that they
have functional impairment that does not limit their activities do not have lower productivity as a result of
functional impairment.


                                                                                                           14
        It can be seen that for the disabled men whose disability greatly affects their
activities (M3), a large part of the differential, 49 percent (0.19), is related to the
observable characteristics of the group’s individuals’ other than their self-declared state
of health. Table 4 shows that the educational level of those in the disabled Men-greatly
group is the main factor in the explained, observable differential (with a relevant and
statistically significant impact). This finding is in line with what was expected, as the
analysis of descriptive statistics found in Table 3 shows that this group has the lowest
percentage of individuals with a college education, even if incomplete.
        Again, for the Men-greatly group, 33 percent (0.13) of the differential was related
to discrimination, 5.2 percent (0.02) to unobserved effects on productivity, and 13 percent
(0.05) to their self-declared state of health. Referring again to Table 3, it can be seen that
among all groups, this group has the lowest percentage of individuals declaring
themselves to be in a good state of health and the greatest percentage of individuals
declaring themselves to be in poor or very poor health. We can summarize the results for
the Men-greatly group by stating that the productivity effect (observed and unobserved)
represents about 18 percent of this group’s differential. It should be emphasized that the
unexplained effect as a whole wasn't considered statistically significant for this group.
        For the Men-moderately group, the results can be summarized as follows: the
productivity effect (observed or unobserved) represents about 54 percent of the
differential, discrimination is responsible for 35 percent of the differential, and other
observed characteristics are responsible for 12 percent of the differential. For this group,
the observed characteristics other than health play a less important role than they did for
the Men-greatly group. As for the "Men-little" group, we have estimated that the
productivity effect (observed or unobserved) represents about 9 percent of the differential,
mainly related to the self-declared state of health, while other observed characteristics
have a negative 17 percent effect. These two characteristics combine to have a negative
8 percent effect (which is offset by discrimination).
        Table 6 presents the results of Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for women. The
wage differential pattern according to the severity of the disability’s effect on activities is
not as clear for women as it is for men. And, the Women-little group had a higher wage
differential than the same men’s group and the Women-moderately and Women-greatly
groups had smaller differentials than the corresponding men’s groups. This is compatible
with findings by Contreras et al. (2006) that the wage differential for women in Chili (6.6%)
and Uruguay (15%) is less than for men.
        The predicted log wage difference for the Women-little group when compared with
unimpaired women was 0.197, a 21.7 percent difference. The predicted hourly wage of
the Women-little group was R$ 5.00 and R$ 6.09 for unimpaired women. As for the
Women-moderately group, the predicted log wage difference compared to the unimpaired
was 0.149, an approximately 16 percent difference, with a predicted hourly wage of R$
5.25. For the Women-greatly group, the predicted log wage difference compared to the
unimpaired was 0.292, a 33.9 percent difference, with a predicted hourly wage of R$ 4.55.
No significant difference was found when comparing the Women-without limitation group
with unimpaired women.

        Column W4 of Table 6 shows that the situation is similar to that for men: the
percentage difference was negatively influenced by the effect explained by the
characteristics (-11.9 percent, but with a P-value of 0.102). Assuming that this effect is
significant, if the average observable characteristics of the unimpaired women were equal
to those of the Women-without limitation group, the unimpaired women’s average
predicted wage would increase to R$ 6.8 per hour (a differential of 10.4%). A major
reason why the Women-without limitation group’s average predicted wage is smaller than
that (R$ 6.8) is related to an effect not explained by the observable characteristics:
discrimination reduces their wage 8.6 percent.
        Interestingly, for the Women-little and Women-moderately groups, the unexplained
effect on the wage differential was not significant, with all of these group’s differentials
being related to some observable characteristic, essentially health status (and education
in the “Women-little” case). This finding makes it easy to conclude that for members of
these two groups, observable productivity effects (health) represent the wage
differential’s main determinant.
        The Women-greatly group’s case is different than that for the other disabled
women’s groups. In this case, both the effect explained by the observable characteristics
(-23.0 percentage points) and the effect not explained by the observable characteristics
(52.2 percentage points) are important in determining the differential. Summarily, the
Explained effect acts negatively on the differential even though the "health" control
variable has the opposite sign. The "other" control variable group, which includes age and
age squared, race, onset of disability, and the Mills ratio, had a negative and significant
effect. Of the 52.2 percentage points from the Unexplained effect, 9.0 percent are due to

      4. Conclusion

        This study examined wage gaps between unimpaired workers and disabled
workers in the Brazilian labor market by gender and by the disability’s effect on activities
performance. We sought to determine if they are due to differences in observable average
characteristics, discrimination or unobserved productivity affect (or a combination of
then). To accomplish this, we performed the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition following the
procedure developed by DeLeire (2001).
        The study’s main results indicate that disabled men and women who face
difficulties in carrying out their activities have lower wages than unimpaired individuals.
For men, this differential is associated with both discrimination in the labor market and
the disability’s negative effect on productivity.
        Overall wage differentials for women were found to be smaller than those
estimated for men and were mainly due to productivity heterogeneity. The only exception
was for the group of disabled women whose activities were severely affected by their
disability, who were found to suffer from discrimination, although, to a lesser extent when
compared to disabled men whose activities were reported as also being severely affected
by their disabilities.
        It is important to point out that two assumptions noted by DeLeire (2001) anchored
our results. The first is that the severity of the disability is not exactly correlated with the
disabled individual’s productivity at work. For this reason, our use of self-reported
information regarding the extent to which the disability actually affects activities, which
makes isolation of the discrimination and productivity effect possible, is important. This
disaggregation is usually beyond the capabilities of other wage gap studies due to data
limitations. The second assumption is that disabled people with limitations at work (and
different degrees of limitation) and disabled people without limitation at work face the
same amount of discrimination.
        As an implication for public policy, we stress the importance of continued
enforcement of the Brazilian Persons with Disabilities Statute (Law n. 13,416, of July 6,
2015) to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the same remuneration as the
unimpaired for work of equal value. In addition, it is not enough that public policies

guarantee participation and equal reward for this group in the labor market, but that they
also efficiently allocate available resources to provide the training and qualification
needed so that the disabled can develop their full productive potential. We are in
agreement with recommendations made by Bordieri & Drehmer (1986) and Parent &
Everson (1982) in this regard.
