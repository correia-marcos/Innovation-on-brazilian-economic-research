Abstract:
This paper theoretically and empirically investigates deindustrialization as a process with multiple and
complex causes, linked to distinct factors and sensitive to the degree of economic development.
Supported by the theoretical framework that reaffirms the centrality of the manufacturing industry for
economic growth, we sought to understand the main determinants of deindustrialization in both
developed and developing countries during the period 1980-2017, through the panel data analysis
methodology. Our main results suggest that there are common causes that contribute to explaining the
advancement of the process of deindustrialization, among them, the increase in per capita income, a
fact already consecrated in the literature. The importance of other variables, however, has shown to be
dependent on the level of economic development: in the least developed countries, variables such as the
exchange rate and the "primarization" of the economy have been prominent factors, while in advanced
countries the importance of "relocation" or "delocalization" of physical production has been
emphasized. With respect to the degree of trade openness, this has proven to be an ambiguous factor,
benefiting countries initially better-positioned in global manufacturing trade but with inconclusive
effects on the lesser competitive countries. In view of these results, a closer look at the causes and costs
of deindustrialization, especially in developing countries.

Resumo:
Este trabalho investiga teórica e empiricamente a desindustrialização como um processo de múltiplas e
complexas causas, ligado a fatores distintos e sensíveis ao grau de desenvolvimento econômico.
Apoiado pelo referencial teórico que reafirma a centralidade da indústria de transformação para o
crescimento econômico, procuramos compreender os principais determinantes da desindustrialização
em países desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento no período de 1980 a 2017, por meio de uma análise de
dados em painel. Nossos principais resultados sugerem que existem causas comuns que contribuem
para explicar o avanço do processo de desindustrialização, dentre elas, o aumento da renda per capita,
fato já consagrado na literatura. A importância de outras variáveis, no entanto, mostrou-se dependente
do nível de desenvolvimento econômico: nos países menos desenvolvidos, variáveis como a taxa de
câmbio e a "reprimarização" da economia têm sido fatores proeminentes, enquanto nos países
avançados a importância da "realocação" ou "deslocalização" da produção física tem sido enfatizada.
Com relação ao grau de abertura comercial, este mostrou-se como um fator ambíguo, beneficiando os
países inicialmente melhor posicionados no comércio manufatureiro global, mas com efeitos
inconclusivos nos países menos competitivos. Diante desses resultados, é fundamental uma análise
mais aprofundada das causas e custos da desindustrialização, principalmente nos países em
desenvolvimento.

1. Introduction
        Unlike the neoclassical-inspired models, post-Keynesian literature (Kaldor, 1966; Thirlwall,
1979) and other heterodox approaches, such as Latin American structuralists (Prebish, 1949) and neo-
Schumpeterians (Freeman & Soete, 1997; Nelson & Winter, 1982), have long emphasized the role of
structural change and technological advancement in economic growth. Despite the centrality of
industrial activity, recognized in the aforementioned literature, a declining trend has been observed
both in the share of value added of the manufacturing sector in total value added and of the share of its
employment in total employment.
        Between 1970 and 2017, the relative share of the manufacturing sector in developed countries
declined, in constant prices, from 17.2% to 15%, while employment share fell from 28.5% to 12.9%. In
developing countries, although the relative share of value added fell from 14.7% to 12.1% in the period
1970-2017, their trajectories were quite different: in Asian economies it increased considerably, rising
on average from 11.9% to 14.5%, but in most other developing countries it declined, with a notable
drop from 18.6% to 13.9% in Latin America. Their employment trajectories, however, were more
similar: although, on average, it remained between 12% and 13% in the period 1970-2017, it rose in
Asia from 11.9% to 14.5% and decreased from 15.5% to 11.9% in Latin American, for example.
        In many countries, particularly in the advanced ones, a reduction in the share of the
manufacturing sector in the economy might be a natural consequence of the development process itself.
However, more recently, it has been noted that this has become associated with the advance of financial
and productive globalization. In fact, the phenomenon has triggered a real revolution in the financial,
productive and business structure, leading to a reorganization in practices at the level of firms: an
expansion and migration of the manufacturing industry from developed economies to developing
countries, or to whole regions with notoriously lower wages, devalued exchange rates and high labor
productivity – the so-called relocation phenomenon. This has led to a change in the global and regional
geography of production and international trade, significantly affecting the productive structure in
advanced countries like the United States, Europe and even Japan. In developing economies, though,
the trajectory apparently has been different (Pisano & Shih, 2009).
        The process of deindustrialization can also be explained by other means. Macroeconomic
policies, for example, by interfering in the trajectory of key prices such as interest rates and the
exchange rate, can determine the performance of the industrial sector, especially in developing
countries where the degree and form of economic openness may be among the drivers of structural
change. Such policies can generate another form of deindustrialization – a “Dutch Disease” kind of
phenomenon, having an increase in exports of basic products (such as agricultural commodities or
extractive minerals), replacing exports of industrial products. Deindustrialization, then, results from
inadequate external integration policies that stimulate the financialization of the economy to the
detriment of the real sector (Bresser-Pereira, 2014; Palma, 2005).
        In light of the above, this paper aims to analyze theoretically and empirically the
deindustrialization underway in recent decades, particularly with regard to the share of the
manufacturing sector in total output. We seek to identify basic determinants in both developed and
developing economies. With a view to test the main arguments in the literature and capture the
determinants of the value added share of the manufacturing sector, the empirical part of our research
estimates a panel data model with 61 developed and developing countries, between 1970 and 2017.
        Our research hypothesis is that, in the context of market liberalization, greater integration and
financialization has impacted economies differently, due to their distinct abilities to deal with
macroeconomic instability and to implement domestic policies (among them, relatively independent
industrial policies). This has mitigated the tendency towards the stagnation of demand, which
reinforces the worldwide trend of deindustrialization, as well as the capacity to generate trajectories of
endogenization of technological progress and active external integration.

        The remainder of this paper is divided into four sections. Section 2 reviews the key role of the
manufacturing industry in economic growth. Section 3 briefly examines the recent worldwide trends in
the decline of the relative share of the manufacturing industry, both in terms of value added and
industrial employment, and discusses possible explanatory elements. Section 4 investigates empirically
the determinants of the share of value added of the manufacturing sector in total value added in several
developed and developing countries, extending the basic model to analyze the effects of trade
liberalization in different contexts. Section 5 offers some final considerations adding that a variety of
factors (e.g., the increase in per capita GDP, interest rates, and the degree of financial integration) can
be considered important in explaining the deindustrialization process in both developed and developing
economies. The influence of some other variables, however, appears to be dependent on the level of
economic development. For less developed economies, the exchange rate and their “primarization”
have been prominent, while for advanced economies, “relocation” of production seems to stand out.
The degree of trade openness, though, plays as an ambiguous variable: benefiting countries initially
better positioned among the manufactures in world trade, while for less competitive countries its effects
seem inconclusive.

2. Industry at the core of economic growth and development
        Recently, there has been renewed interest in the role of the manufacturing sector in the
promotion of economic growth and development. Some factors observed in the world economy have
contributed to this.
        First, many developing economies have failed in their attempt to deepen and diversify their
industrial capacity, and more than that, many of them have seen the share of the manufacturing sector
in GDP shrink prematurely. Second, there is the perception that the export-led growth strategies of
developing countries face more constraints now than in the past, particularly because of the slow pace
of growth in global demand. Third, many developing countries remain highly vulnerable to external
shocks, both commercially and financially. Fourth, the extraordinary export revenues of primary
products, brought about by the commodity price boom in the 2000s, have come to an end. Finally, the
deindustrialization of advanced economies, due to their stagnation in the post-2007 global crisis, has
been a growing concern (UNCTAD, 2016).
        In the literature, there are strong theoretical and empirical arguments that support
industrialization as the main engine of economic growth and development. Szirmai (2012)1 offers a
synthesis of the main arguments:
   i. There is an empirical correlation between the degree of industrialization and the per capita
        income in developing countries.
  ii. Productivity in the manufacturing sector is greater than in the agricultural sector, such that the
        transfer of resources from the second to the first provides a structural change bonus. This means
        the manufacturing sector presents higher rates of productivity growth than other sectors.
 iii. The transfer of resources from the manufacturing sector to the services sector provides a
        structural change burden, under the terms described by Baumol’s Law.2 As the relative share of
        services rises, per capita GDP growth tends to slow.
 iv. Compared to agriculture, the manufacturing sector offers special opportunities for capital
        accumulation. This can be easily realized in the more spatially concentrated environment of the

  The literature reviewed is extensive, ranging from the founding works of Lewis (1954), Hirschman (1958), Kaldor (1966),
Cornwall (1977), and others, to the more recent works of Fagerberg and Verspagen (2002), Rodrik (2009), among others.

  Baumol’s Law derives from the observation that in the various branches of the services sector the possibilities for
productivity growth are limited due to the labor-intensive nature of the sector. Especially for developing countries that have
not yet reached high levels of productivity, an increase in the relative share of services in the economy would mean a
slowdown in productivity growth and, thus, in GDP growth per capita (Szirmai, 2012).
                                                                                                          4

        processing industry than in the more spatially dispersed agricultural sector, since the former is
        more capital intensive than the latter, especially in developing countries. Thus, an increase in
        the relative share of the manufacturing sector contributes to aggregate growth.
   v. The manufacturing sector offers special opportunities for economies of scale, which are less
        available in agriculture or services.
  vi. The manufacturing sector offers special opportunities for technological progress, since
        technological advances originating in the industry are diffused to other sectors of the economy.
 vii. Linkage and spillover effects are stronger in the manufacturing sector than in the agricultural or
        extractive industries.
viii. As per capita income grows, the share of spending on agriculture decreases relative to the total
        and the relative share of spending on manufactured goods increases (Engel’s Law). Thus,
        countries that specialize in the production of primary goods do not benefit from the expansion
        of global markets for manufactured goods.
     Within this line of reasoning, the dynamics of economic growth driven by industrialization can be
understood as a process of “cumulative causation” (Myrdal, 1957; Kaldor, 1957), in which demand and
supply factors interact. With the expansion of the manufacturing sector, there is an increasing
absorption of goods (e.g., food, raw materials and extractive industry materials) and services (e.g.,
banking and financial services, insurance, trade, etc.) produced outside the industrial sector, generating
jobs, income, and demand. The manufacturing sector also accelerates productivity increases, boosting
income and demand growth. Due to linkage and spillover effects, the continuous upgrading of
productive capacity tends to favor (i) productivity gains in other sectors, (ii) the adoption of more
advanced technologies, (iii) the production of more sophisticated products, and (iv) integration in
global value chains at increasing levels of complexity (Cantore et al., 2014; UNCTAD, 2016).
     Recently, an increasing number of authors have emphasized the importance of industrialization as a
key element for a strategy of economic growth (Palma, 2010, Rodrik, 2008, TIMMER, VRIES &
VRIES, 2015). Especially for developing countries implement macroeconomic policies for this purpose
is an essential condition for embarks on a sustainable path of catching up with both levels of income
per capita and quality of life relatively close to the developed countries.

3. Recent trends of industry in the global economy
        Over the past four and a half decades, significant changes have occurred in the sectors of
economic activity around the world. According to the regional groupings by UNCTADstat (2019),
developing and transition economies3 have expanded their share of global output between 1970 and
2017, through growth in both industrial value added4 and services, from 7.5% to 13.1% and from 7.9%
to 18.7%, respectively, while the share of the primary sector has remained virtually constant, at around
2.5%. Furthermore, in relation to global value added, the share of industry of developed countries
declined from 27.9% to 15% between 1970 and 2017, with services falling marginally from 54.6% to
47.6%.
        The manufacturing sector of developed economies, in particular, experienced a fall from 14.5%
to 9.7% in the same period. The share of the industrial sector in the group’s value added also declined,
falling from 33.1% to 23.6%, and although services increased their share from 64.7% to 75.1%,
globally they have reduced slightly. In developing and transition economies, the average share of the
services sector in the group’s aggregate value added also has increased, from 44.2% to 54.5%. On the
other hand, the average share of the industrial sector has dropped slightly from 42.1% to 38.1%, which
– in view of the increasing share of the sector in terms of global value added – implies quite distinct
performances regionally or even individually.

    This includes both processing and extractive industries.

       Taken as a group, the manufacturing share in developing and transition economies total value
added reduced slightly from 14.9% to 12.1% in the period 1970-2017, while in developed economies
the sector’s share fell from 17.2% to 15.4%. Graph 1 shows the different trajectories of the regional
groups. From 1970 to 2017, with the exception of the Asian regions, there was a general reduction in
the share of the manufacturing sector in total value added. A reduction in the “industrial gap” of other
developing and transition economies vis-à-vis advanced economies is observed.

        Regarding employment in the manufacturing sector, the picture is slightly different. In the
group of developed countries, the other face of deindustrialization is much more pronounced.
According to Table 1, between 1970 and 2017 the average share of employment in manufacturing
activities relative to total employment fell from 28.5% to 12.9%. In Latin America, employment in the
manufacturing sector also declined from the 1980s, when it accounted for 15.4% of the total, reaching
11.9% in 2017.

        The decline in industrial employment was also significant since the 1980s in East Asia, the
transition economies and South Africa, while in some other countries in Africa and Asia, like India and
West Asia, there was relative stability or a slight increase, in general.
        In contrast, there was strong growth in employment in manufacturing in several Asian
countries, notably China, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Turkey, although currently more
mature economies such as Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore have negatively affected the
behavior of some of these regional averages, especially since the 1990s.
        The conventional interpretation is that deindustrialization is a natural outcome of the
development process, due to the combination of changes in the composition of demand and the greater
productivity gains in the manufacturing sector compared to the others. Assuming that income elasticity
of demand for manufactures is greater than unity in the early stages of development, and in the more
advanced stages, it becomes less than unity, then in the course of the development process this change
in the composition of demand would favor the services sector to the detriment of the manufactures. In
isolation, this factor would be insufficient to explain deindustrialization as it disregards the influences
of productivity and the changes in relative prices in the structure of demand, and thus in industrial
output and employment. Assuming the same conditions for income elasticity of demand, given that
labor productivity grows more rapidly in the manufacturing sector, then in the course of economic
development there would be a reduction in the relative prices of manufactured goods, stimulating
demand for them in the early stages, while in the more advanced stages there would be a substitution
effect towards other items, such as services (Rowthorn & Ramaswamy, 1999).
        Therefore, the net effect on industrial output and employment depends crucially on the behavior
of demand in response to changes in relative prices. Depending on the response of demand to the
falling prices of manufactures, the change in production and employment may be positive or negative.
In the advanced economies, there is strong evidence that the fall in relative prices for manufactures due
to productivity gains is not sufficiently compensated by an increase in demand for these goods (          ),
so that the relative quantities of the sector (value added and employment) begin to decline, with the
decline in employment relatively faster (Rowthorn & Ramaswamy, 1999; Lawrence & Edwards, 2013,
Rodrik, 2016).
        Other frequently analyzed aspects refer to the phenomenon of globalization, particularly in
regards to the effect of international trade or a new international division of labor, where depending on
the established pattern of trade there could be a specialization in production between manufactured
goods and other goods and services, or even a specialization within the manufacturing sector between
the production of skilled and unskilled labor-intensive goods. For developed countries, although this is
not the main means affecting deindustrialization, evidence suggests a negative impact on demand for
labor, particularly less skilled or less specialized labor (Wood, 1995; Rowthorn & Ramaswamy, 1999).
        In developing countries that are deindustrializing, however, it is unlikely that the classic
argument of the combination of changes in the composition of demand and labor productivity will
apply, since, given the elasticity of demand at this stage of economic development, the difference in
productivity in the manufacturing sector would further stimulate demand for industrial goods, feeding
the sector’s growth. An alternative explanation lies precisely in international trade.
        According to Rodrik (2016), a plausible interpretation is that when they opened up to
international trade, developing countries were hit by a double blow. First, those without solid
comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector became net importers of these goods, reversing the
long process of import substitution. Second, by being exposed to the relative price trends in advanced
economies, developing countries would have “imported” the deindustrialization of those countries.
This is because the fall in relative prices of manufactures in advanced economies squeezed the price
globally, even in those countries that had not yet experienced high technological progress. In fact,
considering the regional groups, the author finds evidence that the regions with strong comparative
                                                                                                                             9

advantage in manufactures managed to avoid the decline in the relative share of output and
employment, and even when this occurred, it was less severe. Consequently, the main beneficiaries of
globalization would have been the Asian countries, while the adverse effects would have mainly been
felt in Latin America, particularly in terms of employment.
         The recent process of relocation of industrial plants around the globe is also receiving attention
as a factor that induces deindustrialization, especially in developed economies. According to Palley
(2015), a critical change brought about by globalization is high international mobility of the factors of
production (capital and technology), resulting from improvements in the transport sector,
communications, and in the ability to manage globally diversified production networks. This has
created a new global production model configured around the principle of global cost arbitrage, in
search of, for example, favorable exchange rates, lower taxes, subsidies, less regulation, and abundant
and cheap labor.
         Palma (2005, 2008), Palley (2015) and UNCTAD (2016), also note that since the 1980s
deindustrialization in developed economies – particularly in some European ones – has not been very
harmonious or spontaneous, since it has been following the path of political, financial and institutional
transformations that have generated macroeconomic instability and a regressive distribution of income.
This could contribute to the slowdown in aggregate demand and limit the capacity of the services sector
to productively absorb the labor freed from the industrial sector, which in turn leads to high and
persistent levels of unemployment and underemployment, to underconsumption and to low levels of
productive investment in these economies. These elements could also apply to developing economies
experiencing premature deindustrialization.
         In other words, the intensification of deindustrialization could be the result of inadequate
policies and a negative structural change (financialization). Austere macroeconomic policies,
particularly high interest rates and overvalued exchange rates, would have more pronounced negative
effects on industry and the “real economy” than on the financial sector, contributing to the
financialization and, concomitantly, to deindustrialization. Moreover, liberalization itself and
increasing deregulation help to reduce autonomy in domestic economic policy, whereby key prices,
such as interest rates and exchange rates, and national policy objectives (e.g., industrial policy) are
often destabilized and hampered by the interests of foreign organizations and by dominant players in
the financial market, both locally and internationally.
         In view of this, the recent industrializing success of Asian economies is attributed in large part
to the fact that their governments have subordinated the financial sector to the needs of industrial
development through strong regulation and the mobilization of financial sector resources. In contrast to
this is Latin America, where since the 1980s the lack of consensus or strategy for industrial
development after the exhaustion of the import substitution process and the shift toward a liberalizing
agenda and market friendly reforms could help to explain the stagnation of productivity in these
economies.5
         Finally, an additional source of deindustrialization defined by Palma (2005, 2008) is the “Dutch
Disease”. This phenomenon is associated with a change in the “natural” trajectory of industrialization
or with an excessive degree of deindustrialization relative to what would be expected given the level of
per capita income, the productivity of the manufacturing sector, and the elasticities of demand, etc.
This “extra” degree of deindustrialization could result from three different situations: (i) the discovery
of abundant natural resources (e.g., the Netherlands), (ii) a significant increase in the export of services,
particularly in finance and tourism (e.g., Hong Kong and Greece, respectively), and (iii) changes in
economic policy, especially financial and trade liberalization in middle-income countries (e.g., Brazil
and South Africa).

    For a detailed discussion of these arguments, see, for example, Palma (2010) and Lechevalier, Debanes and Shin (2016).
                                                                                                                       10

        Therefore, there are several sources of deindustrialization, and there are probably different
combinations of these sources that explain this process in each country in a given period of time better
than any of them considered in isolation. In this paper, the intended contribution to the literature is to
offer a more detailed analysis on the aspects associated with globalization, such as trade openness and
greater financial integration. In light of this, it is understood that the prioritization of financial
accumulation to the detriment of productive investments could have contributed to the establishment of
high global macroeconomic instability and stagnation of aggregate demand, in which the worldwide
trend of deindustrialization emerges as a reflex.

4. An empirical investigation into the causes of deindustrialization in developed and developing
economies

        In the previous sections, it was pointed out that a reduction in the share of industry in GDP can
be a natural consequence of the process of economic growth. Moreover, other variables linked to
macroeconomic stability, such as interest rates and exchange rates, may contribute to the performance
of the industrial sector, especially in developing countries, since their effects can be exacerbated by the
degree of openness of foreign economies.
        Another factor to consider is the Dutch disease, which could be related, for example, to an
increase in the export of primary products. Also worthy of mention in the case of developed economies
is the relocation of industry phenomenon, in which many large companies move their plants to
developing economies with lower production costs. Finally, deindustrialization could result from
inadequate policies and a negative structural change made evident by the increase in financialization to
the detriment of the real sector.
        That said, equation (1) attempts to capture these determinants of the share of value added of the
manufacturing, in both developed and developing countries.
    vamanit = gdppcit + vaprim it+ rerit + nirlendit + ififtit + fdigdpit + openit + uit             (1)
        where, vaman is the value added of the manufacturing sector in total value added; gdppc is the
per capita GDP; vaprim is the value added of the agricultural sector in total value added of the
economy; rer is the real exchange rate; nirlend is the interest lending rate; open is the degree of trade
openness of the economy, measured as the sum of exports and imports in proportion to GDP; fdigdp are
the acquisitions of direct investments abroad by the residents, in terms of GDP, used as a proxy for the
relocation of production.
        Regarding the ifift variable, it should be noted that this indicator generally expresses the degree
of financial integration or de facto financial liberalization of an economy and is given by the
aggregation of financial inflows and outflows registered by the balance of payments of each country, in
proportion to the trade flows.6 Considering that the phenomenon of financialization can be envisaged in
general terms as a gain in importance of the financial sector relative to the real sector, it is understood
here that this integration variable can also capture movements in this direction, when considering in
external terms whether the country’s integration is predominantly via the financial or the productive
sector.
        These variables, their sources and the list of developed and developing countries are described
in detail in Table 2 and Table 3 in the Appendix to this paper. There are data for 61 countries between
1980 and 2017, but given the lack of some observations, this is an unbalanced panel of data. However,
taking into account the presence of endogeneity between the variables of the model, the dynamic panel
data model approach was considered, based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) proposed

by Arellano and Bond (1991), which is consistent when applied to dynamic models. This leaves us with
the following equation:
       ΔYit = Δαi + δΔYit-1 + β´ΔXit + Δεit                                                     (2)
        Our strategy consists of using the GMM method to estimate the model in first difference, using
all possible lags as an instrument for the lagged variable. For endogenous variables, their lagged levels
are used as instrumental variables, and for predetermined variables, their levels are lagged once. This
method seeks to use all the information contained in the sample to construct the set of instrumental
variables, concomitantly eliminating the specific non-observable effect and allowing the estimation.
The result of the estimation of equation (1) for the developed countries is in Table 2.
        In the case of developed economies, the increase in per capita GDP is the main determinant for
the reduction in the share of value added of the manufacturing sector. The negative relationship
between GDP per capita growth and the relative share of industry in GDP is a crystallized fact in the
literature and is associated with the degree of economic development and changes in elasticities of
demand. The proxy for financial integration and financialization, the degree of trade openness variables
and the proxy for the relocation of industry also presented statistical significance.

        These results corroborate the arguments presented earlier that, among other factors, the
deepening of financial integration and financialization would play an important role in explaining the
performance of the manufacturing sector in the recent period. In addition, the process of relocation of
industrial plants, which are concentrated according to the direct investment flows of the developed
economies, also contributed negatively to manufacturing production. Obviously, not all direct
investment is destined for the industrial sector. Yet the significance and the final effect of this variable
suggest that, at least for developed countries, an important part of the volume of investment flows is
associated with this sector. However, the real exchange rate and the value added of the agricultural
sector were not significant, contradicting, at first, assumptions associated with the effects of real
exchange rate appreciation, or even a structural change toward the primary sector of the economy.
        As for financial integration, contrary to the theoretical formulations in favor of openness and
financial integration, several empirical studies have shown that there is no strong evidence of a positive
                                                                                                                    12

relationship between greater liberalization/financial integration and economic growth.7 The high
destabilizing potential of globalized finance, though, is indisputable in light of history, particularly for
developing countries. Singling out from extensive literature, it is worth mentioning Prasad, Rajan and
Subramanian (2007) and Eichengreen et al. (2009), who found a positive relationship between financial
openness and growth in the industrial sector. However, this effect is limited to high-income countries
with developed financial systems and sound institutions. And in the case of Eichengreen et al. (2009)
these positive effects are canceled out in crises. For these reasons, the results found here contribute to
reinforcing the skepticism regarding the net benefits of financial integration.
        For developing economies, the results of the estimation of equation (1) can be found in Table 3.
Regarding these countries, the significance of the variable used as a proxy for the Dutch disease or for
the primarization of productive activity to explain the fall in the share of the manufacturing sector in
total output, as well as per capita GDP, stands out. Additionally, the proxy for financial integration and
financialization contributed negatively, which is in line with the result obtained for the developed
countries. In contrast, however, the real exchange rate was statistically significant, indicating that
higher levels of the exchange rate (devalued) positively influenced the value added of the
manufacturing sector.

        It should be noted that the result of the real exchange rate reinforces the arguments that consider
it an instrument capable of inducing a successful process of industrialization, especially for developing
countries. As examples, Rodrik (2008) and Rapetti, Skott and Razmi (2012) show the important role of
exchange rate policy or the exchange rate as an instrument to induce structural change toward more
technologically sophisticated productive sectors, and consequently, toward a diversification and greater
dynamism of exports. In particular, Rodrik (2008) finds two empirical regularities. First, a devaluation
of the exchange rate has a direct positive effect on the relative size of the tradable goods sector,
especially those related to industrial activities. Second, the effects of the real exchange rate on growth
operate, at least in part, through changes associated with the relative size of the tradable goods sector.

In other words, countries in which devaluation induces a resource allocation to the tradable goods
sector – especially to industrial activities – grow faster.
        On the other hand, the proxy variables for relocation and degree of openness were not
significant. In the case of relocation, the result is not surprising, since the relocation process is not a
significant feature of developing economies in general, nor do these economies present significant
volumes of foreign direct investment relative to advanced economies.
        Given that the degree of openness was not significant, as well as the hypothesis previously
raised that the countries which benefit from trade liberalization are those with a consolidated industrial
sector and a trade surplus in the manufacturing sector, this issue was investigated by dividing the total
group of countries in the research into two sub-samples according to the existence of a trade deficit or
surplus in the manufacturing sector. Since information for this variable was not available for many
economies in the 1970s, the two groups were separated starting from 1980. The criterion for defining
surplus and deficit countries was the average of the trade balance observed in the first five years of
each period analyzed, subject to the availability of data.8 Considering also that the 1990s represents a
period of significant deepening of the process of trade globalization, often distinguished as the
beginning of the era of “hyperglobalization”,9 the model was estimated again using this period as the
starting point, following the same criteria defined above.
        Table 4 shows the results of the estimation of equation (1) for the countries with a trade surplus
in the manufacturing sector, according to the aforementioned periods.

        It should be noted that the results for the degree of openness are particularly interesting. In both
the period 1980-2017 and the interval 1990-2017, the significance of this variable and its positive sign
confirms the hypothesis that for countries that have already had a certain degree of competitive
advantage in the manufacturing sector (expressed in their surplus with the rest of the world), greater
trade openness would have had a generally beneficial effect on the added value of the sector and
therefore on the industrial development of those economies. The remaining variables maintain the
expected sign, as well as the statistical significance, except the financial integration variable, that is no
longer significant.
        Finally, Table 5 presents the results of the same model of equation (1) but now applied to the
countries that presented deficits in the trade of manufactures at the beginning of each period analyzed.
It can be observed that, for countries with a trade deficit in manufactures, the degree of openness of the
economies were negative in the 1980s but no longer significant in terms of their effects on the relative
share of value added of the manufacturing industry in the 1990s. No significance in this case may be
associated with the greater heterogeneity observed in the deficit group, since several countries,
particularly the Asian ones, managed to overcome the initial disadvantages and become surplus
countries, while others experienced an even greater deterioration in the manufacturing sector’s trade
balance.

        In any case, the result for the surplus economies confirms the hypothesis that trade
liberalization had different effects on the economies, reinforcing the comparative advantages in the
production of manufactured goods in this group of countries, whereas the effects are not clear for the
deficit group. It should be highlighted that for the deficit group of countries, the exchange rate becomes
a positive and significant variable to explain the trajectory of industry, being (as discussed previously)
an important instrument of industrial and foreign trade policy, in view of the lower competitiveness of
its manufacturing sector vis-à-vis the group of surplus countries.
          In addition to the exchange rate, for the deficit group it should also be highlighted that the
value added of the agricultural sector, representing a primarization of production, and the degree of
financial integration at the second regression were both significant and contributed negatively to the
performance of the manufacturing sector. The results for the deficit countries are more aligned with
those obtained for the developing countries, reflecting the greater representativeness of these countries
in the sample.
        Considering that the estimates greatly depend on the validity of the instruments used to identify
the endogenous variables, it is worth noting that the Sargan test was performed to check the validity of
the instruments used in each of the four models. Failure to reject the null hypothesis indicates that the
instruments used are robust. Therefore, the tests for the models indicated that the restrictions used are
valid.
        The serial autocorrelation test examined the hypothesis that the error term is not serially
correlated. More specifically, it was tested whether the differentiated error term is serially correlated in
second order (by construction, the differential error term is, probably, serially correlated in first order,
even if the original error term is not). The tests indicated that the null hypothesis of non-existence of
second order serial correlation in the differentiated error term in the four models estimated cannot be
rejected.

5. Final Considerations
        The present paper has analyzed deindustrialization as a set of processes, investigating its main
determinants in developed and developing economies, during the time interval 1980-2017. In line with
our chosen theoretical framework, the centrality of the manufacturing sector for economic growth was
discussed, underlining how the occurrence of deindustrialization in the last decades took place. This
was observed as a fall in the value added share of the manufacturing sector in total value added at the
same time as a fall in the employment share in relation to total employment in the various economies.
        Deindustrialization, characteristic of most economies in the last decades, has manifold and
complex causes, linked to several distinct factors. It may be a natural consequence of the very process
of economic development, but its factors are rooted in other sources, namely (i) the behavior of
variables linked to macroeconomic policy/stability (such as interest rates and exchange rates) and to
trade and financial openness/integration; (ii) the occurrence of the so-called Dutch disease type of
phenomenon; (iii) industrial relocation, with firms’ production migrating from advanced economies to
developing countries; and (iv) financialization of the economy to the detriment of the real sector.
                                                                                                        16

        In order to test these arguments, the empirical part of our research used the estimation of a panel
data for 61 countries and the time interval 1980 to 2017. Explanatory variables were sought to reflect
the main sources of deindustrialization as they are discussed in the literature, especially in the context
of growing economic globalization.
        Our results show that for developed and developing economies the increase in both per capita
GDP and the degree of financial integration are good explanatory factor candidates of
deindustrialization. The relevance of other variables, in contrast, appears to be dependent on the level
of economic development. For the less developed economies, exchange rates and primarization play a
prominent role. In advanced economies, it is relocation of production that seems to stand out, reflecting
firms’ strategies to capitalize gains on relative prices (mostly factor prices and labor wages) and access
new expanding markets. As anticipated, it does not seem that the degree of trade openness proves to be
such a key variable: its role is at least ambiguous, benefiting those countries already more competitive
in manufacturing in world trade. Contrary to the implications of the literature, it does not seem to exert
any major effect on countries less competitive in manufacturing.
        Basically, the contribution of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we have reviewed a vast
literature on deindustrialization, in both developed and developing countries. On the other, we have
shown (or tried to show with the available data) that, while there is an almost universally accepted
definition of deindustrialization (trivially measured in terms of value added and/or in employment
shares of the industrial sector), there is, in fact, a more interesting set of diverse processes behind
deindustrialization. The diversity runs so deep that one begins to wonder whether the naming itself (and
the related measuring sticks) makes sense. In any case, it calls for a closer look at each process or each
“family of processes” of deindustrialization, accepting the idea that a family of processes is a
parameterized set of similar dynamics, with distinct parameter values.
        This paper has actually focused first of all on what could be considered the determining factors
of deindustrialization, common to both developed and developing countries, without questioning the
standard definition(s) or the related various explanations. We then carried out an empirical exercise.
So, in the end, even though we had started with a rugged landscape (a “panel”) of diverse countries and
had gone through checking for relevant variables shared by all, we discovered that, in reality, it is the
very definition that, being so coarse, allowed us to find common variables. In other words, by taking a
more interesting closer look, we encountered models of deindustrialization, on which, at this moment
in our investigation, we can only speculate.
        However, there does seem to be at least two models. Again by model here, we mean a
parameterized family of processes “alike” to one another in some sense, perhaps in their mechanics.
One such family is deindustrialization as a reversion to primary production, most possibly at early or
not yet mature stages of technological development. While, here too, we have a reduction of industry’s
share in value added and/or employment, the causes are different and they may also vary from country
to country, though most of them, if not all, are developing countries. This is the case in point with
countries of Latin America. Brazil, for example, in the new global market place and production chain,
found itself locked out of the “factories of the world”. China is another case in point. Possibly
premature deindustrialization in the words of Palma (2005, 2008, 2010) and Rodrick (2008, 2016)
takes place. Or it is often a Dutch disease that takes place and contributes to explaining the mechanics.
        The alternative model is the delocalization model, through which many regions and/or national
economies find exporting production profitable, but retain design, architecture and whatever most
contributes to value added. This same model can generate coexisting, contradictory effects in certain
places. That is, one region of the USA (say California or Wyoming) is earning fat rents from their idea
factories, while vile physical production is elsewhere. Elsewhere in the same country, the rust belt is
suffering, among many other reasons, at the same time from the same delocalization process.

        All in all, this shows that we need to take a closer look at the social costs of delocalization in
developed countries. But also a closer look at how deindustrialization is taking place in developing
countries: with a leopard spotlike pattern, inducing a local cluster to arise around delocalized industries
from abroad, or as a generalized maquiladora. Mexico is probably the country that most clearly has
both of them. Could this be the reason for the recent negative attention given to it?
