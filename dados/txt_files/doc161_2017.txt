Abstract
        This paper aims to study the complementarity between exporting and innovation in the Brazilian
industry. Do rms become more prone to invest in innovation after becoming an exporter? We tackle
this issue by analyzing Brazilian rm level data from 1998-2011 linking three databases through
a rm identier.We use propensity score kernel matching combined with dierence-in-dierences
approach to help deal with endogenous exporting, sunk exporting costs and common macroeconomic
shocks across industries.        The ndings show that exporting is associated with further innovation
expenditures, although this eect vanishes two years after entry in the export market.

1         Introduction
                                                                                                                  1
        The literature widely recognizes that exporters are more productive than non-exporters.                        Two
mechanisms explain this asymmetry. First, exporters may be more productive than their domestic
counterparts, allowing than to overcome the sunk cost of export and to compete in international
markets (Melitz, 2003; Bernard et al., 2003). The second mechanism is related to the ability to learn
from foreign markets, enabling rms to gain new knowledge and expertise, improving their level of
eciency (Biesebroeck, 2005). These two non-competing hypothesis (self-selection                        versus   learning
by exporting) had been extensively tested and surveyed over the last fteen years, when datasets at
rm level all over the world became available.
        The role of exporting in shaping a rm's future productivity was surveyed by Wagner (2012),
revealing that this debate is far from settled. In fact, innovation is shown as a missing link in the
eect of exporting on rm's characteristics.            Thus, we explore learning eects from trade through
rm innovations, acknowledging that trade does not necessarily translate into immediate TFP (Total
Factor Productivity) improvements, but may impact TFP growth or rm survival in foreign markets
                      2
in the long run.           Our approach is silent on the exact theoretical mechanism, which has been

outlined by Bustos (2011), who extended Melitz (2003) and shows how trade liberalization through
MERCOSUR aects technology upgrading by Argentinian rms.
     We nd that Brazilian rms are more prone to innovate after export market entry. However, this
eect is no longer visible two periods after entry. When examining whether such achievement is due
to exporting per se or to the entry into foreign markets, we nd that only newly exporting rms
increase their innovation expenditure.
     Lileeva and Treer (2010) present rm heterogeneity derived from Canada-US Free Trade
Agreement's tari cuts.         They conclude that market size matters for innovation and hence for
productivity.       Smalls rms increased their labor productivity while productivity gains for high
productivity plants are negligible.       Bloom et al. (2016) use the removal of product-specic quotas
following China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 to assess whether there is
trade induced technical change on rms most aected by Chinese imports in their output markets.
Finally, Albornoz et al. (2012) argue that rm's uncertainty about their success after export market
entry plays an important role to understanding their export pattern, specially regarding destination
countries and timing.
     The channels that Bustos (2011), Lileeva and Treer (2010) and Bloom et al. (2016) investigate
are slightly dierent from ours. In fact, they focus on trade liberalization while we remain attention
on (newly) export status itself. Do rms become more prone to invest in innovation after becoming
exporter? To investigate this channel, we merged three dataset of Brazilian rms linked by its CNPJ
tax identier. This dataset comprises production, exports, imports and innovation gathering all set
of information based on international standards over 1998-2011.                 To soften potential endogeneity
issues, we rely on kernel propensity score matching (Abadie and Imbens, 2011) combined with
dierences-in-dierences techniques as proposed by Blundell and Dias (2009) to rule out constant
external eects over time. Following Lileeva and Treer (2010), we allow two sources of heterogeneity:
in initial productivity and in the productivity gains from investing (on innovation).
     Despite the lack of data on export promotion policies, we argue that APEX's creation on 2003 and
                                                                                                          3
some others exports support instruments play an important role in explaining such eect.                      APEX's
goal is to provide training, consulting and advisory services in order to increase the competitiveness
and promote the export culture in companies, ultimately preparing them for the challenges of the
international market.       The Brazil Exporter Program, also launched in 2003, gathers 44 projects
under MDIC's coordination (Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade), some existing,
but that have undergone a readjustment on focus, and others were created. The programs are aimed
at the adjustment of products and the processes, funding for micro and small enterprises, guarantee
funds, among others.        In fact, placebo tests for year 2008 conrm the robustness of our ndings,
showing that starters at 2008 do not innovate more after entry, unlike 2004's entrants.
     Following this introduction, the paper is organized as follows. The second section describes the
dataset and main procedures, section three presents the methodology and section four discusses the
main ndings and policy implications. The fth concludes.

identier, the National Registry of Legal Entities (CNPJ - Cadastro Nacional de Pessoa Jur√≠dica) ,
gathering the rm-level inputs and outputs of Brazilian rms for the period 1998-2011.
    We describe below each of the datasets.


PINTEC         The Brazilian Innovation Survey was launched in 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2011
comprising national and regional indicators of the technological innovation activities developed in the
Brazilian industrial enterprises with 10 or more employees. Some rms were also randomly surveyed
by the PINTEC, in which quantitative and qualitative data on R&D expenditures and innovation
were gathered. The information collected refers to the rms' characteristics; the product innovations
and/or process implemented, incomplete or abandoned;                    to developed innovative activities;          to
expenditure on these activities; to nance these expenditures; attributes of internal R&D, skill level
and hours devoted; innovation's impact on sales and exports; sources of information used by rm; the
cooperative arrangements established with other(s) organization(s); government support; patents and
other protection methods; the problems faced by rms; and organizational and marketing innovations.
    The methodological and conceptual references of PINTEC is based on the third edition of the
Oslo Manual (OECD, 2005) and, more specically, on the model of the Community Innovation
Survey  CIS version 2008, proposed by the Statistical Oce of the European Communities, which
was attended by 15 European Union member states.                      This ensures quality of information and
comparability with international data.           PINTEC remains focused on products and processes, but
also comprises organizational and marketing innovation.
    There are three types of variables on PINTEC database: the original ones from questionnaires,
the variables constructed through PINTEC survey, and variables from other sources such as RAIS
(Annual List of Social Information, from the Ministry of Labor), PIA and PAS (Annual Services
Survey, from IBGE). Original ones do not provide information on which rms are                   general   innovators,
revealing only who implemented         product   or   process   innovations separately (binary variables on each
condition). To dene who are the innovative rms, we follow the PINTEC survey structure presented
in 1 . Not all rms answer all questions as can be seen in this owchart. Thus, beyond the process
and product innovation, we must account for abandoned and incomplete projects and also correct
for zero/missing misassignments. After such modications, the number of innovative rms matches
with ocial reports for every year.
    The variable of interest is      expenditure on innovation activities,         that can be calculated as the
sum of reported expenses on: internal R&D, external R&D, acquisition of other external knowledge,
software acquisition, purchase of machinery and equipment, training, expenditure on introduction
of technological innovations in the market, industrial design and other technical preparations for
production and distribution. As can be seen, our denition of Innovation goes beyond R&D activities.


SECEX        Administrative records of all exporting and importing companies distributed into ve
value ranges (US$ FOB). It is collected by Secretary of Foreign Trade (SECEX) of the Ministry of
Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC). We then construct dummy variables regarding
foreign orientation.


PIA     Survey conducted annually by IBGE that captures basic characteristics of the Brazilian
industrial segment. We use the non-random sample of all Brazilian mining and manufacturing rms

The data need to be accessed at the IBGE site and it involves signicant red tape. In particular, after the calculations
the results need approval by technical and ethic committees under scal regulations, before being released.

Documentation and Dissemination of Information) Service Guidelines No. 01/03 of 09/10/2003.

over all federal units (Estrato Final Certo, receiving a complete questionnaire). It has three main
groups of variables: i) longitudinal relations across rms; ii) balance sheet and income statement;
iii) other economic information such as investment ows, employees and origin of rm's capital.
Sectors are reclassied from CNAE 2.0 (Classica√ß√£o Nacional de Atividades Econ√¥micas 2.0) to
International Standard Industries Classication (ISIC) Rev 3.1 for international comparison purposes.
See Muendler (2003) for PIA's further characteristics.
      Due to time-span limitation, we need to collapse the PIA and SECEX database following PINTEC
availability. We then split the sample into ve periods (1998-2000, 2001-2003, 2004-2005, 2006-2008,
2009-2011) before merging then. Besides innovation expenditure, an important feature of the merged
dataset is that PINTEC allows us to control for state and regions, which is not possible with PIA
dataset. Nominal variables were deated into real values at constant 2012 prices using the IPA/OG
index at sector level (wholesale price index), published by Getulio Vargas Foundation.                       Nominal
Wages, in turn, were deated by national consumer price Index (INPC) at constant 2012 prices.
Also, CNAE classication changes after 2007, which requires translation from CNAE 1.0 into CNAE
2.0 from 1996 to 2006. This only applies for PIA and PINTEC dataset (because SECEX export and
import ranges is converted into dummies).
      The nal unbalanced panel contains 42,272 observations distributed along 24 two-digits sector
level and ve waves, where 45% are exporters, 51% report general innovation and 28% of the
                                                                         9
companies are in both innovation and exporting activities.                   Specically, 32% executed product
innovation, 43% invested on process innovation, while 24% reported both innovative types between
1998-2011.      The majority of rms rely on low-tech manufacture of food products whilst the less
numerous is in the Tobacco's manufacture.




3       Methodology
      We have no relevant and intuitively convincing set of instruments for a rm start exporting. To
tackle this self-selection issue, we rely on Heckman et al. (1997) and isolate from our sample the
group of exporting-starters and non-exporting rms. Therefore, we wish to know the outcome
(y ) of treatment obtained by the dierence in the innovation expenditure for companies that have
experienced the treatment (starter )          vs.   those have not been exposed to it.         Every period    t,   the
average impact of starting exporting on innovation (s             = {1, 2, 3}   periods ahead) can be computed
as:
               E[y 1 t+s ‚àí y 0 t+s |starterit = 1] = E[y 1 t+s |starterit = 1] ‚àí E[y 0 t+s |starterit = 1]          (1)

where    y1   and   y0   are potential outcomes from been starter and non-starter, respectively.
      In order to infer the impact of starting exporting on innovation expenditure we need to know
what would have happened to the company that entered the export market if it had not done so.
That is, we are in pursuit of a counterfactual situation, which of course constitutes a problem as this
fact is not observed by the researcher  which is represented by the last term in Equation 1.
      To overcome this problem we match each rm that switched into exporting with a derived
counterfactual, constructed over the distribution of non-exporting rms.                     We assume that the
self-selection of companies is based on characteristics that are observable              and/or   unobservable but
xed in time. Therefore, the most appropriate strategy to identify the eect of start exporting is
the combination of Propensity Score Matching with Dierence-in-Dierences techniques.
      Specically, the rst-stage logit estimation captures the likelihood that rms become exporters
based on observable pre-exporting attributes of the rm. To ensure a good match, it is crucial to
identify treatment (starter) and control (always non-exporter for the whole sample) groups with
substantial overlapping rm characteristics (common support).                   Both control and treatment rm

                                                           4
groups are then assigned to strata according to its propensity score.                      Kernel regression estimator
chooses the weights so that the closest observations receive greater weight.
    As proposed by Heckman et al. (1997), matching and di-in-di can be combined to accommodate
unobserved determinants of the non-treated outcome aecting participation for as long as these are
constant over time. This approach can be applied when treated and non-treated are observed over
time with at least one observation before and one after the treatment.                       Blundell and Dias (2009)
establish that we can compare the evolution of treated outcomes with that of non-treated over the
observation period and assign any dierence to the impact of treatment.
    After Matching, the di-in-di specication we want to estimate on matched sample is:


        innov _expendi,t+s = Œ≤0 + Œ≤1 ¬∑ starteri + Œ≤2 ¬∑ postt + Œ≤3 ¬∑ starter‚àó postit + Œ≤k ¬∑ Xit + uit                 (2)


where   innov _expendi,t+s        is the self-reported expenditure on innovation (in R$) from PINTEC
database.    This variable accounts for both product and process innovations and is evaluated up
three years after the rm's entry into the international market.                 starter   is a dummy that is zero for
rms that are domestic (never exports on the whole sample) and equals one when the rm starts
exporting. We examine two kind of entry on export market:                   starters when rm i did not export in
t‚àí1   and export in    t;   and   entrants   for rms that did not        export in t ‚àí 1, export in t and in t + 1
(entry and remain as exporter). The variable              post   accounts for follow-up period, which we set on
2004. Finally,   X   refers to baseline covariates which includes a complete set of sector dummies at
the two-digit level, state dummies, technological intensity (Table 1), raw materials, size (number of
                                       10
employees), capital, productivity           and energy. The full set of year and sector aims to control for
common aggregated demand and supply shocks. The very same                          X vector was previously used for
kernel matching rst-step procedure.           We are interested on the           Œ≤3 coecient, which indicates the
causal impact of start exporting on innovation expenditure.
                                           d
    Denoting d as rm's treatment status, yid is the outcome for rm i at time t when their treatment
                                                 0
status at that time is d: it means that is y when the rm belongs to the non-treated group
                                                                   1
(never-exporting) or when the time is t0 (before 2004) and is y when the rm is in the treated
group (newly exporting) and the time is           t1   (after 2004). Then, the assumptions are:


   a. Conditional on the observables         X,   the evolution of the unobserved part of         y0   is independent of
      the treatment status. Thus, controls must evolve from a pre- to a post-program period in the
      same way treatments would have evolved had they not been treated.

matched each treated to exactly one rm that did not export during the whole sample, allowing
us to yearly choose the best match over a multi-dimensional pre-exporting characteristics.                          The
set of pre-treatment variables are:          dummies for 2-digit sector, federal units, log(raw materials),
technological intensity (ranging from 1 to 4 according Table 1), log(size) proxied by average number
of employees during the year, log(capital), log(energy) and log(real wage per worker). We estimate

energy and raw material expenses as a proxy, deated by the IPA-OG (sector-specic). Output is
calculated by industrial transformation value in log (manufacturing) and we treat rm's usage of
blue and white collar labor as freely variable inputs.            Capital is calculated by standard perpetual
inventory method (see OECD, 2001a for details). Labor productivity oers a dynamic measure of
economic growth, competitiveness, and living standards within an economy. Alternatively, we test a
wide variety of (log) labor productivity proxies summarized on Table 2, relying on its basic denition:
ratio of a volume measure of output to a measure of input use. Table 3 show the number of treated

become more prone to innovate (outcome variable). This period coincides with a number of policies
aimed at improving competitiveness of Brazilian rms. Indeed, we carried out falsication test with
year 2008 to test whether there are similar results. If they are, it may suggest that 2004's starters
would be similar to 2008's.




4      Results
     Under learning by exporting hypothesis, there are eciency gains immediately after export market
entry.     These gains stem from a more competitive environment, better supply-chain management,
new business practices, adjustments of product portfolio, new processes, among others. Consistently
with Bustos (2011), our results indicate that there is a signicant correlation between switch to
exporting and innovation expenditure in the period after export entry.
     Table 4 indicates that becoming exporter is consistent with higher innovation expenditure one
      12
year       after entry by about R$235 thousand for those rms that enter and remain exporters (variable
entrants).     For   starters,    a less restrictive proxy for entry, this eect is an increase of about R$160
thousand on innovation expenditure (Table 5).              Using dierent productivity measures to provide
sensitivity analysis show that results change by about 6% for entrants and 4% for starters.                This
impact is signicant at 10% level of signicance.             Table 5 shows no statistical signicance for the
switch's impact two years after entry.           However, three years after start exporting, rms decrease
its innovation investments by approximately R$246 thousands (more than the amount spent in the
rst year of international experience). All results should be interpreted as compared to the baseline
domestic status (rms who never exported in the whole sample).                  This suggests that the larger
investments are taken before or at last immediately after entry on export markets. Firms that enter
and remain exporting do not show any statistically signicant change on innovation investments two
and three periods after switching status.
     Do the results stem from entry on export markets?               It means, we should ask whether this is
a regularity for exporters or a particularity for starters.          To answer this question, we carried out
one-to-one match for domestics and exporters on the same multi-dimensional set of pre-exporting
variables. Now, we assign to treated group those rms that are continuing exporters (regardless
of its experience on international markets, continuing exporters are those rms that export for at
least one year, which may include rms that enter, exit or switch status). The comparison group
remains the never-exporting rms. Table 6 provides average treatment eects on treated and shows
no eect for exporters      vs.   domestic rms. It suggests that it is indeed the rst-time rm experience
on international market that drives innovation expenditure, not exporting per se.
     In addition to the evidence of correlation presented above through matching strategy, we carry
out regressions accounting for time-varying external shocks.              This double-dierence estimator is
calculated as the dierence in average outcome in the treatment group before and after treatment

    12 In fact our measure of time is not years, but (PINTEC's) waves or periods. Due to PINTEC availability, we
needed to collapse the dataset, which left us with ve periods.

minus the dierence in average outcome in the control group before and after treatment  Equation
2.   The follow-up period is set after 2004 because it coincides with some changes on Brazilian
exports promotion policies.     The treatment is       entrants   and   starters,   which represent switching
from domestic to exporter status. The outcome is the innovation expenditure in the period following
entry (t + 1). We carried out kernel propensity score matching, which assigns weights to construct a
control group selecting on the same set of rm's pre-exporting characteristics.
     Figures 2, 3 and 4 parallel yearly before-after propensity score densities to provide evidence of
matching quality. To prevent that missing values aect the quality of control-treatment assignment,
we perform matchings for dierent outcome variables. Balancing tests between control and treatment
groups do not reject the null hypothesis of mean equality between the two groups after matching.
As matching is carried out for every wave, we show balancing tests for each of them. Table 7 shows
the dierence-in-dierences estimates for         entrants   while Table 8 report results for          starters     as a
robustness check.
     For those rms that did not export in         t‚àí1   and start exporting in       t,   the   starters,   innovation
expenditure increases by R$280 thousands compared to baseline situation, ranging approximately
12% depending upon productivity measure used.                For those rms that enter export markets and
remain as exporter for at least two years (entrants), in turn, switching into exporter increases
innovation expenditure by R$420 thousands, ranging from R$370 thousands to R$460 thousands
across productivity covariates. The result is slightly responsive to the productivity measure used.
     As a robustness check we also test if this result is random or even driving by something that
we are not accounting for. There is no clear intervention been used as instrument that could cause
such increase on innovation expenditure for starters after 2004. Therefore, we conduct a falsication
test using 2008 as a placebo follow-up period. In fact, Tables 9 and 10 show no eect of entry on
innovation, using   entrants   or   starters,   respectively. Results remain unchanged across the complete
set of productivity measures. So, we conclude that newly exporting rms from 2008 does not innovate
more after start exporting, while starters from 2004 do.
     Hence, we can infer that export market entry indeed causes innovation expenditure in                     t+1   and
that policies on 2004-2008 period are imperative for this result. However, this nding can still reveal
a combination of two policy outcome targeted by such policies. Because of the acknowledgment of
exports' importance for economic growth, the export promotion mechanisms become relevant and
settled into its goals both export market entry and product improvements.




5      Concluding remarks
     It is extensively argued that only the most productive rms are able to make positive prots
from exporting, giving rise to the self-selection mechanism into these markets. However, there is less
consensus whether export market entry aects rm performance after entry (learning by exporting).
This paper aims to investigate the role played by innovation as a possible channel for such a link.
     We control the self-selection bias by restricting the original sample to two comparable subsamples
of control and treatment groups.            To identify the counterfactual group,                it is assumed that
all dierences between starters and the appropriate comparison group (non-exporters) can be
captured by a vector of observables through Kernel propensity score matching. Once we have this
counterfactual in hand we use a Dierence-in-Dierences methodology to assess the impact of export
market entry on innovation expenditure up to three years after entry.
     We nd that entry into international market indeed is correlated with more expenditure on
innovative activities such as internal and external R&D, cooperations, training, purchase of machinery
and equipment, among others.           This eect, however, disappears two periods after entry.                  When
examining if such achievement is due to exporting per se or to the entry into foreign markets, we
nd that only newly exporting rms increase its innovation expenditure on subsequent period.

   Also, comparing starters before/after 2004 with their counterpart non-starters and controlling for
common macroeconomic shocks across rms, we nd that entrants are more prone to innovate one
period after entry. This result is consistent with a falsication test using year 2008 as follow-up period.
We thus conclude that 2004-2008 entrants have dierent incentives to start and innovate after entry.
This allows to say that a set of public policies aimed at promoting Brazilian exports abroad after
2003 can be identied as partially responsible for such result. Finally, the main policy implication is
that innovation can be viewed as complementary investment for newly exporting Brazilian rms in
order to assure competitiveness.
