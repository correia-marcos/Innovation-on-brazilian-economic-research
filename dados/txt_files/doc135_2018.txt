                                            Abstract

In the last decades, we witness an increase of the R&D performed abroad by multinational
companies. These companies have progressively adopted an internationally integrated approach to
their inventive activities. This paper contributes to the literature on R&D internationalization by
analyzing locational factors, which drive multinational companies to use captive offshoring to fund
their R&D activities in developing countries. The paper considers the R&D investment performed
by the majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies abroad. We construct a temporal
database panel containing 75 countries and apply a random-effect Tobit model. The results
highlight some important determinants to explain U.S. R&D captive offshoring in a developing
country: (1) R&D investment cumulativeness; (2) National Innovation Systems maturity; and (3)
Market size. This implies that attracting knowledge and innovative activities from abroad depends
on policies designed mainly to enhance some elements of National Innovation Systems.

Key words: Innovation, R&D internationalization, R&D captive offshoring, MNC.

1        Introduction: setting the scene and research questions

         In the last decades we testimony a fast and increase growth of R&D performed abroad by
multinational companies (MNCs, henceforth) (UNCTAD, 2005a, 2005b; OECD, 2008) which has
become recognized by many scholars who got interested in the strong trend towards its
internationalization1. Notwithstanding that, international allocation of research activities is not
recent (Lall, 1979; Cantwell, 1995).
         The expansionary trend of private U.S. R&D performed abroad through foreign affiliates –
the so-called R&D captive offshoring – provides a sound example of private R&D
internationalization. Indeed, there are recent studies that demonstrate there is a continuing increase
of U.S. private R&D abroad (Laurens et al., 2015; NSB, 2016). Figures from 1997 illustrate that
U.S. R&D captive offshoring was USD 18,935 million and it reached USD 39,470 million in 20102.
In relative terms, it represented 9.4% of overall R&D developed at home in 1997 and 14.1% in
2010.
         Both economic and business literature has paid ample attention to the locational factors that
affect U.S. R&D internationalization. There are numerous empirical studies carried out in the last
decades which revel that R&D intensity of U.S. affiliates is determined mainly by domestic market
size, overall R&D capability and cost of hiring R&D personnel (Kumar, 1996, 2001; Doh et al.,
2005; Thursby & Thursby, 2006; Flores & Aguilera, 2007; Hegde & Hicks, 2008; Athukorala &
Kohpaiboon, 2010). Moreover, there are other relevant factors such as domestic business
environment aspects – availability of technical personnel, nature of property right legislation, tax
concessions, political stability, foreign trade regime (Athukorala & Kohpaiboon, 2010) – and also
institutional and cultural aspects – political and legal systems, cultural similarities and levels of trust
(Flores & Aguilera, 2007).
         That being said, most U.S. R&D captive offshoring is performed in Europe, Canada and
Japan – Triad countries (Chesnais, 1994). In fact, ‘Triad’ receives 73.6% of total U.S. R&D captive
offshoring in 2010 and if we consider in this group other high-income countries such as Australia,
New Zealand and the Asian Dragons (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea), the
concentration increases to 88.5%. The other 11.5% goes to the ‘Rest’of which Brazil, China and
India concentrate 77.1%. Looking at a long-term perspective, Brazil, China and India seem to be
more and more attractive players in global R&D while other middle and low-income countries are
still not part of the game.
         If that holds true, why do some developing countries such as Brazil, China and India
concentrate more U.S. R&D investment? This question straightly leads to the following one: What
are the local features that make some developing countries more ‘inviting’ for U.S. R&D captive
offshoring?
         Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the locational factors that are more (or less)
relevant in a developing country3 to attract R&D investment from MNCs headquartered in the U.S..
Once we identify those factors, we can provide insights to answer the previous questions. Although
there is an academic literature that examines empirically the factors that drive the location choice of
R&D activity abroad (Demirbag & Glaister, 2010; Siedschlag et al., 2013), there is a limited
number of studies that present a specific analysis regarding developing countries’ specificities
focusing in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and India, taking into account the U.S. R&D

Brazil, China and India that make them more attractive than other developing countries for U.S.
companies’ R&D investments. It also complements the work done by Chiarini (2017), who makes
an exploratory analysis of the recent U.S. inward R&D-related FDI in Brazil, China and India. This
is where the originality of this study lies and where it intends to make its contributions.
        The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. On section 2, we make an appreciative
theorizing, showing that R&D is a key activity and it is performed at home (onshore) and abroad
(offshore). It is important to mention that by no means this section covers all the literature available
on corporate R&D efforts and its internationalization as it goes beyond the scope of this paper and
once it is possible to find it elsewhere4. Against this background, on section 3, we present the
empirical methodology (data, some descriptive analysis of the database and the modelling). On
section 4, we present the econometric results. On section 5, we introduce an exploratory discussion
on what regards Brazil, China and India as the main developing countries receivers of U.S. R&D
investment. Finally, in the last section, we address the main conclusions.

2       Framing corporate investment in R&D: why to invest abroad

        Companies’ competitive advantages come from their accumulated capabilities to create,
transfer, combine, assemble, integrate and exploit knowledge assets. Knowledge assets help
building the company’s capabilities which in turn underpin the company’s products and services
offering to the markets (Teece, 2004). Consequently, performing R&D is a relevant activity, once
not only does it generate new knowledge, but also enhances the company’s ability to assimilate and
exploit existing ones from the environment – what it is called a firms’ ‘absorptive’ capacity (Cohen
& Levinthal, 1989, 1990).
        It is part of a company’s strategy to decide to perform R&D in the home country (onshore)
and/or in a foreign country (offshore). In order to take advantage of foreign technological
capacities, companies locate their research labs and production facilities in many locations via
networks of internal units (set of subsidiaries and headquarters) and via external networks. This way
it is possible to access the tacit part of technology that is specific to the context in which new
technologies are created. To access the complementary assets to innovation, MNCs have local
presence through the combination of research (for learning) and skills related routines in the
production.
        We can say that the innovative efforts are a principal source of a company’s ownership
advantages. In this way, the ownership advantages are dynamic: they seek to improve and to search
news advantages. The learning process that leads to innovation is also an ownership advantages,
and subsidiaries can enlarge their knowledge base from the global, local or internal knowledge
network, which are contingent on the strategic choice made by the headquarters (Athreye et al.,
2016). Therefore, MNCs that are able to organize a network – subsidiaries and parent companies –
to knowledge creation and exploitation taking advantage of local specificities, act in different
National Systems of Innovation.
        Before the 1980s, innovative activities were mainly centralized and performed in-house in
the home country (Kurokawa et al., 2007) especially because of supply-side reasons such as scale
economies (Vernon, 1966) and because of higher appropriability of R&D efforts (Granstrand et al.,
1993). Notwithstanding that, it was also possible to see a growing R&D outsourced to providers in
the home country, especially to universities and research institutes (Nelson, 1990).
        A strong trend towards the internationalization of R&D begins in the 1980s (Archibugi &
Michie, 1997; Archibugi & Iammarino, 2002; UNCTAD, 2005a) both captive offshoring and
offshore outsourcing, nevertheless empirical studies show that the former is still preferred to the
latter (Albertoni & Elia, 2014). The increasing offshoring trend is driven in large measure by
technology factors (Florida, 1997). Thus, companies perform R&D abroad to secure access to

                                                                                                      3
scientific and technical human capital (Florida, 1997) – even if they risk to have their R&D leaked
to foreign competitors (Athukorala & Kohpaiboon, 2010) – in order to improve existing assets and
to tap into knowledge around the globe (Dunning & Narula, 1995). Accordingly, this trend reflects
the global character of knowledge assets creation and exploitation (Teece, 2004). In fact, a recent
econometric study suggests that MNCs that offshore their innovative activities are more productive
that those that offshore their non-innovative tasks (Tabrizy, 2017).
        Innovation studies literature indicate that there are two centrifugal ‘forces’ capable of
explaining the dispersion of R&D activities abroad. Firstly, because of the need to adapt production
processes and products to suit to local conditions and regulations, i.e., asset/competence exploiting
or home-base-exploiting R&D (Dunning & Narula, 1995; Kuemmerle, 1999; Cantwell & Mudambi,
2005). In fact, a large share of R&D investments from MNCs has been focused on the
adaptation/standardization to local demand conditions, especially in developing countries.
        Secondly, in order to benefit from localized technology spillovers in these locations, that is,
companies locate R&D facilities abroad, especially in prominent centers of excellence in specific
technologies, in order to enable themselves to enrich their own R&D (Athukorala & Kohpaiboon,
2010), i.e., asset/competence augmenting or home-base-augmenting R&D (Kuemmerle, 1999;
Dunning, 2009). This is the case to overcome lock-in traps, i.e., MNCs perform research abroad to
have access to external knowledge available (Levinthal & March, 1993), to benefit from potential
knowledge spillover opportunities (Feinberg & Gupta, 2004) and to take advantage of qualified
personnel (Lewin et al., 2009).
        Many developing countries try to attract high-value added activities (R&D, engineering and
product design) from abroad, however, attracting foreign investment in R&D and trying to host
innovative activities may require the participation of the most productive MNCs that are likely to be
larger in size (Tabrizy, 2017). This may have negative effects for emerging countries.
        For example, if MNCs acquire indigenous firms’ research facilities, the host country loses
the control towards the technology previously locally produced and may also reduce the levels of
research done locally. As part of rationalization strategies, mergers and acquisitions may lead to a
reduction of R&D activities and the remaining R&D becomes narrower in scope (or more focused)
and its time horizon becomes shorter (UNCTAD, 2005b). There are empirical evidences that show
that less developed countries are chosen for low-value R&D (or adaptive R&D), that is, product and
processes adaptation to local conditions and activities not related to knowledge creation. Therefore,
MNCs may impose a new type of international division of labor in which advanced countries carry
high-value R&D activities while less developed countries carry low-value R&D. The former adding
more value in the global chains and the latter adding relatively much less value, blocking the
national system of innovation access to the global knowledge network (Marin & Arza, 2009).
        The arguments developed in this section point to the many locational factors that affect the
decision of a company to offshore R&D. For example, different levels of territorial and social
embeddedness may or may not motivate overseas R&D and its location (Cantwell & Piscitello,
2002). Therefore, the motivations and determinants to establish R&D labs in different developing
economies may diverge and only a small number of them are able to attract foreign R&D
investment. In the next section, we propose different econometric models that help us understand
why only a few of them can take part of this very fierce game.

Therefore, in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 we make an effort to present them.

3.1.1 Dependent variable: U.S. R&D captive offshoring data

        The departure point of the database is the dependent variable U.S. corporates’ R&D captive
offshoring. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides historical series for outward
direct investment including R&D figures in millions of current U.S. dollars for many countries
worldwide. However, for many others BEA presents an aggregate value for a group of them
according to their geographical region, this is so to avoid disclosure of confidential information or
because the value invested was relatively insignificant.
        We assumed null value for these grouped countries, since the sum by region was statistically
irrelevant. For example, in 2000 ‘other European countries’ accounted for about USD 9 million
(only 0.05% of U.S. R&D captive offshoring in total Europe). In the same year, for instance, ‘other
South American countries’ accounted for less than USD 500 thousand.
        We also deflated the time series using the GDP deflator (year-base 2010) available at the
WB database. Once the database regarding the U.S. corporates’ R&D captive offshoring was done,
the first things to note was its increase thorough time (Table 2) and its fluctuation together with
economic cycles. From 1997 to 2000, the average growth rate was 10.50% per year, however, with
the Dot.com bubble burst in late 1990s, U.S. corporate R&D investment abroad falls and the rate in
2001-04 reduces to 3.97% per year. In the following period (2005-08), investment starts to grow
again, reaching 9.90% per year, when there is an economic recovery. However, with the 2008
financial crises, R&D investment abroad reduces drastically and there is a negative growth rate of
3.61% (in 2009-10). This suggests that R&D investment is pro-cyclical and it is sensitive to
economic conditions (Archibugi & Michie, 1995). Therefore, we control the models with a dummy
trying to capture the economic cycles.
        Table 2 also permits us to verify right away that most of U.S. R&D captive offshoring is
concentrated in developed countries and they concentrate as an average 91.09% of total U.S. R&D
investment abroad (in 1997-2010).

3.1.2 Independent variable: Innovation system data

        Another variable used in the model is what we called ‘innovation system’ and we defined it
as the first factor obtained by the factor analysis technique for different variables. There many
possible variables used in the literature to characterize an innovation system (IS) ranging from a
narrow to broad definition of IS (Lundvall et al., 2009). The previous focuses on effort-related and
performance-related indicators. The main ones proposed are R&D expenditure, S&T expenditure,
human resources allocation in R&D, patent applications, scientific publications, etc. (Lundvall et
al., 2009). However, some IS elements and relationships that directly affect the national learning
capacity are both informal and difficult to measure. For this reason, in a broad perspective, other
indicators that analyze social institutions, communication and education infrastructure, the type of
relationship between actors, etc., should be considered (Lundvall et al., 2009).
        Unfortunately, due to the lack of comparable data in historical perspective for many
countries, we opt to focus only on indicators from a narrow definition of IS. The ones selected are:

    a.   R&D investment;
    b.   Patents deposited at USPTO per capita;
    c.   High-technology exports;
    d.   Economic complexity index (ECI);
    e.   Scientific/technical journal articles per capita.

        ‘R&D investment’ is the current and capital expenditures (both public and private) on
creative work undertaken systematically to increase knowledge. R&D covers basic research,
applied research, and experimental development. ‘USPTO patents per capita’, on its turn, refers to
the number of patent applications filed in the United States Patent Office by country of origin –
based on the residence of the first-named inventor – per million inhabitants.
        The factor ‘High-technology exports’ represents products with high R&D intensity, such as
in aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and electrical machinery. And the
factor ECI, according to Hausmann et al. (2013), is a scale that uses the theory of and calculations


                                                                                                                                         6
for economic complexity to rank countries according to their level of complexity. It ranks how
diversified and complex a country’s export basket is5.
        Finally, the factor ‘Scientific and technical journal articles per capita’ refers to the number
of scientific and engineering (physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, clinical medicine,
biomedical research, engineering and technology, and earth and space sciences) articles published
per million inhabitants.
        The first factor is able to explain 99.75% of total variance. Besides, each variable has the
following correlation with first factor: ‘R&D expenditure’: 0.9646; ‘USPTO patents per capita’:
0.8848; ‘High-technology exports’: 0.3671; ECI: 0.7497; ‘Scientific/technical journal articles per
capita’: 0.8162.

3.1.3 List of countries

        Getting a temporal database for a large number of countries is not an easy task. There is
non-negligible lack of information for many of them, which makes quite hard to form a balanced
panel data. We made an exhaustive work to make databases compatible in order to include the
largest number of countries as possible. We got in total 75 countries (dispersed all over the world)
that appears at least one year at the sample (Table 3). Unfortunately, we were not able to consider
more countries since information were not available and among the considered 75 ones, there is still
a lot of missing data, which means that we were obligated to deal with an unbalanced panel data6.
These are probably unneglectable limitations of the database and consequently of the model.
        With the list presented in Table 3, we could separate them into developed versus developing
countries. It is worth to emphasize that the group of developing countries is not stable throughout
our period of analyzes (1997–2010) once we used the level of income as a proxy for economic
development. Therefore, some countries historically changed their income level status, according to
the World Bank methodology. For example, Croatia is considered a high-income country only after
2008, so from 1997 to 2007 it is grouped as a developing economy (middle and low-income
country). Other countries considered high income countries are: South Korea (from 2001), Saudi
Arabia (from 2004), Trinidad and Tobago (from 2006), Barbados (from 2006), Czech Republic
(from 2006), Estonia (from 2006), Slovakia (from 2007), Hungary (from 2007), Latvia (from 2009)
and Poland (from 2009). Consequently, the groups of developing countries vary yearly.

    According to Wooldridge (2008) this should not be considered a crucial problem, since the reason for the lack of
    data of some observation i is not correlated with the idiosyncratic errors.
                                                                                                                       7
        With the data available, we opt to use a panel data econometric method for censored
outcomes through random-effect Tobit model7. The panel data is important considering the time
interval (1997-2010) and it combined with a Tobit model since a large number of countries has null
values for U.S. R&D captive offshoring during the period (so, a left-censored dependent variable in
zero).
        The random-effects Tobit model is calculated using quadrature, which is an approximation
whose accuracy depends partially on the number of integration points used. Then, we establish a
procedure to check the quadrature approximation, verifying whether the changes in the number of
integration points affect the outcomes8. We define three distinct models:

    a. a complete model with all the 75 countries in data base;
    b. a model with only developed countries (high-income countries); and
    c. a model with only developing countries (low and middle-income countries).

         To test the robustness of each model we tried two different specifications:

    a. GDP per capita and population presented in logarithm values;
    b. GDP per capita and population presented in natural value.

        Therefore, we have six different models. Finally, we performed different tests to find the
best quadrature for all six models. As a rule of thumb, if the coefficients do not change by more
than a relative difference of 10−4 (0.01%), the choice of quadrature points does not significantly
affect the outcome, and we can confidently interpret the results. We reach confidence when
considering a maximum of 195 integration points (the upper limit of integration points) since the
model with developed countries subsample specified by GDP per capita presented in log values
(called Model 2) demands that. Model 1 (full sample specified by GDP per capita presented in log
values) reached consistent results with at least 120 integration points. We present the models in the
next section.

4        Econometric results and discussions

        As presented in section 3.2 before, we had two different specifications of our models. We
use GDP per capita and population data in both logarithm values and in natural values. The two
specifications seem to be robust, that is, GDP per capita and population in both logarithm and
natural values do not change drastically the estimation results. In Table 4, we present the parameter
estimates and results for all the models, and then, in the next subsections, we propose some possible
interpretations.

    There is no way to proceed with a parametric conditional fixed-effects model, as it does not exist a sufficient
    statistic allowing the fixed effects to be conditioned out of the likelihood. Unconditional fixed-effects Tobit models
    would be fit with the Tobit command, but the estimators would be biased. The software used is STATA 13.
8
    We use the quadrature check command in Stata (quadchk) to verify coefficient results’ consistency.

4.1          Previous R&D investments

        We find there is a positive relation of current R&D expenditure with previous year’s R&D
expenses for all the models presented in Table 4. This positive relation may be derived from the
rigidity of investment in innovative activities, since previous R&D investments define a sort of sunk
cost whose maintenance of investment becomes necessary for the maintenance of already
established R&D activities. In other words, technological knowledge generation may be
characterized by elements of a path-dependent persistence (Narula, 2002; Antonelli & Colombelli,
2013).
        That being said, one can propose that R&D is cumulative and complementary, that is,
inventive activities are conditioned on knowledge levels already achieved by the companies.
Therefore, the generation of new knowledge is built upon current and past knowledge (Nelson &
Winter, 1985; Malerba & Orsenigo, 1993) and innovative success yields profits that can be invested
again in R&D (Nelson & Winter, 1985), encouraging more R&D and innovation. According to
Antonelli and Colombelli (2013), the “generation of new knowledge at time t is possible only
                                                                                                                                              9
standing upon the shoulders of the technological knowledge that has been generated until that time”
(p. 31). Therefore, R&D cumulativeness and complementarity may create a group of developing
host countries where U.S. companies keep investing in R&D, promoting a sort of R&D
centralization.
        The previous finding corroborates other empirical studies presented in the literature. For
example, Demirbag and Glaister (2010) show that MNCs’ prior R&D activities in a specific country
increases the likelihood of that country being selected by the MNCs for offshoring R&D projects.
        Indeed that is exactly what data presented in Table 2 shows: most U.S. R&D captive
offshoring throughout the years is still confined to Triad countries even though it seems to be
evolving into a ‘new geography’ (Bruche, 2009), increasingly extending its investment to some
developing countries. In this regards, Table 2 shows that, in 1990s the target of U.S. corporate R&D
in developing economies was focused in Latin American countries (huge investments in Brazil).
However, in the 2000s there is a turn towards South Asian countries. China and India enter the
global R&D scene (Bruche, 2009).

4.2    Market size

        The market size is measured by two aspects: population size and income (whose proxy is
GDP per capita). While population size presents statistical significance for all the models (except
for Model 5), GDP per capita presents statistical significance for Model 1 and Model 4 (which
consider all 75 countries) and for Model 3 and Model 6 (which consider only developing countries
through the years). Model 2 and Model 5 (which consider only developed countries) do not have
GDP per capita statistically significant. That said, we can suggest that U.S. corporate’ captive
offshoring may be affected by host countries’ population and GDP per capita – market size proxies.
This confirms the importance of demand as presented in some empirical studies (Cantwell & Janne,
2000). This is an expected result, as local demands generate product adaptation needs. In this sense,
cultural preferences, local infrastructure features or even climatic conditions – i.e., particularities of
markets – are taken into consideration.
        For example, in Brazil it is well known that automotive industry performs what it is called
‘tropicalization’(Costa, 2005; Consoni & Quadros, 2006) – adaptation of products to local
conditions. One example of this is that carmakers subsidiaries in the country need to equip cars with
specially developed damping systems due to road conditions.

4.3    International openness

        In all models presented in Table 4, the sum of exports of goods and services plus imports of
goods and services as a percentage of GDP – proxies for the country’s international openness – was
not statistically significant. Therefore, data tell us that characteristics of international openness are
not relevant for U.S. corporate R&D captive offshoring.
        This finding corroborates the empirical analysis proposed by Kumar (2001) that says that
economic openness is not statistically significant for attracting U.S. R&D expenditure to developing
countries. His openness variable is different than the one proposed here. He tries to capture the
relative policy openness of a country’s trade regime and his variable was estimated by adjusting the
trade intensity (total merchandise trade as a percentage of GNP) for structural factors. According to
him “more restrictive trade regimes may attract more R&D investments than more open ones
keeping other things same, especially in developing countries. A possible explanation for this
outcome is that import barriers encourage MNE affiliates to undertake indigenization and hence
product and process adaptations locally by making imported alternatives more expensive.” (p. 169).
        This is a significant result once it goes against the expectation that productive integration
would be an inductor of the technological upgrade. This refers to other inductive factors, and
immediately to the role of the State capable of inducing such investments.

                                                                                                       10
4.4    Innovation system

        The factor representing the National Innovation Systems – R&D expenditure, USPTO patent
application per capita, high-technology exports, economic complexity index, and scientific and
technical articles per capita – is relevant for U.S. corporate R&D captive offshoring.
        Although the National Systems of Innovation are statistically significant in all models, there
are considerable differences in coefficient magnitudes. Considering only developed countries
(Model 2 and Model 5) one can conclude that their Innovation Systems seem to be relatively more
relevant to U.S. companies in their decision in R&D captive offshoring than developing countries
(Model 3 and Model 6), which could confirm the knowledge augmenting type hypothesis of R&D
abroad in developed countries (Kuemmerle, 1999; Dunning, 2009).
        The influence of the National Innovation System of a host country on the location decision
of MNCs’ R&D activities was also empirically presented by Demirbag and Glaister (2010). They
show that the more developed the knowledge infrastructure and the larger the pool of experts for
R&D projects of a country, the greater the likelihood of that country being selected by a MNC for
offshore R&D projects.
        For the developing countries, it seems that U.S. companies are interested in their level of
income, indicated by their GDP per capita. It does not mean, however, that developing countries’
Innovation Systems are not important – since the coefficient of this variable is significant –
however less important that developed countries’ innovation systems. This could corroborate the
thesis of knowledge exploiting or home-base-exploiting R&D in developing countries (Dunning &
Narula, 1995; Kuemmerle, 1999).
        In this regard, the average value for ‘Innovation System’ variable in developing countries
with positive values for U.S. R&D captive offshoring is -0.46, and -0.66 for countries with null
values. In developed countries these values are, respectively, 1.04 and -0.36. Furthermore,
comparing trajectories of countries that have reached a high-income country status (proxy for
development) during the period gives interesting insights. Countries with null values for U.S. R&D
captive offshoring – Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Slovak and Trinidad and Tobago –
have medium values of Innovation Systems equal to -0.56 in 1997 and -0.30 in 2010 (only Estonia
presents significance improvement on results, from -0.48 to 0.46). The other countries – Czech
Republic, Hungary, Korea Republic and Poland – obtained an average growth for U.S. R&D
investments of 14.9% per year in the face of an average increase in the Innovation System’s value
of 0.03 to 0.72.

4.5    Controlling variables

        For all the models presented, we use a group of controlling variables (distance and dummy
for economic cycles). Geographical distance is not significant in any model, that is, U.S. companies
do not consider the distance of the country where they are going to invest in R&D. This is so once
those ‘transactional benefits of spatial proximity’ are much less important today than they were
before (Dunning, 2009). Therefore, the decision to invest in R&D either in Brazil or in Mexico is
not affected by the proximity to the U.S. This is congruent with other empirical studies that show
that geographic distance has a relatively low impact on R&D investment (Castellani et al., 2013).
        The other controlling variable used is the dummy for economic cycles. This is done once
there are fluctuations of R&D investment during the period of analysis. From Table 2, we can
noticed that U.S. R&D captive offshoring declined during economic crisis (2000-01 and 2009)
mainly because of the investment reduction in developed countries, as those countries were the
epicenter of the crisis (Lane, 2012). Therefore, we can expect that R&D expenditures are sensitive
to economic cycles, as presented in the literature (Archibugi & Michie, 1995; Guellec & Ioannidis,
1997; François & Lloyd-Ellis, 2009).
        Still on the same argument, looking at Table 4, we can see that the Dotcom Crisis (2000-01)
was not statically significant for any model. However, the Financial Crisis (2009) was for Model 1
                                                                                                    11
and Model 4 (which consider the 75 countries) and Model 2 and Model 5 (which consider only
developed countries), affecting negatively U.S. R&D captive offshoring. In other words, in those
years, U.S. corporate R&D captive offshoring in developed countries was negatively affect by
economic cycles. This is expected, once returns to R&D investment are subject to uncertainty and
during national income drastic reductions companies do not expect to invest in risky and long-term
activities.
        In what regards Model 3 and Model 6, crisis were not statistically significant to explain U.S.
corporate R&D captive offshoring in developing countries. The previous finding may suggest that
U.S. R&D captive offshoring in those countries is more resilient to the financial crisis than
developed countries. This may be so once R&D performed in developing countries are home-base-
exploiting type. Therefore those countries, which did not suffer immediately the negative impacts of
the crisis, continued to receive R&D investment from the U.S. (especially Brazil, China, India and
Indonesia) in order to get adapted production processes and products to suit local conditions and to
take advantage of their market size.
        We could also suggest that the strategy of U.S. companies in what regards their inventive
activities is to reduce monetary inversions in countries where there is a higher stock of investments
(developed countries), preserving the values in countries with lower R&D structure (developing
countries). The U.S. R&D captive offshoring average in developed and developing countries were,
respectively, USD 959.9 million and USD 56.4 million during all period of analysis 9. During the
economic downturns, the R&D investment decline in relation to the previous year was 7.3% for
developed countries and 5.1% for developing ones in the first cycle (2000–01) and 12.5% for the
former and 2.0% for the latter in the second cycle (2009).

5       Brief analysis of the most attractive developing countries to U.S. R&D investment

        Brazil and China are emblematic cases to understand the evolution of U.S. R&D captive
offshoring in developing countries and their ability in attracting it. During the period 199 –2010, the
increase in GDP per capita was of 27.4% and 215.9% in Brazil and China, respectively.
        The increase of U.S. R&D captive offshoring experienced by China – and presented in
Table 2 – must have happened for the most part because of Chinese Innovation System. Brazil has
its value for ‘Innovation System variable’ varying between -0.10 and -0.24 in the period, without a
clear improvement trend. China, on the other hand, has seen its ‘Innovation System variable’ value
jump from -0.49 in 1997 to 0.43 in 2010, in a constant upward trend.
        Therefore, considering the models’ findings presented in Table 4, the national innovation
capacity improvement is important to ensure China has a better long-term position to maintain and
increase its attractiveness in R&D investments from U.S. companies. Therefore, if Brazil continues
‘to skid’ on innovative results, its trend should be less satisfactory than the Chinese ones.
Consequently, upgrading S&T infrastructures and institutions must be a continuous policy in
developing countries. In fact, recent empirical studies demonstrate that those countries that join the
league of receivers of knowledge and innovation from FDI invest in elements of absorptive capacity
(Filippetti et al., 2017). For that reason, investments in human resources, physical infrastructure and
R&D are the basic policies a developing country should focus on.
        Back to the question proposed in the Introduction of this paper: why do some developing
countries such as Brazil, China and India concentrate more U.S. R&D investment? According to
our models, the answer lies on the fact that those three countries have already accumulated great
amounts of U.S. R&D investment, the size of their markets and because of their relatively better
Innovation System vis-à-vis other developing countries.
        Despite the increasing of U.S. R&D in Brazil, China and India, some recent empirical
studies demonstrate that favorable conditions of host countries may not lead to the enhancement of
subsidiaries’ R&D functions (Achcaoucaou et al., 2017). Therefore, knowledge integrations

between parent companies and their subsidiaries are not simple and do not happen automatically
(Singh, 2008).
        In fact, in what regards the case of Brazil, China and India, Chiarini (2017) show elements
present in the literature that demonstrate that most R&D undertaken in the three previous countries
is directed to local adaptations and not directed to new product development. In other words, R&D
captive offshore in Brazil, China and India is focused mainly in activities devoted merely to
adapting products to local reality, that is, ‘adaptive R&D’.

6      Final considerations

         With significant changes in international economic scenario, companies have changed their
strategies taking into consideration the governance (outsourcing versus internal development) and
geographical location (offshoring versus domestic) of their innovative efforts (Mudambi, 2008;
Martinez-Noya et al., 2012). Indeed, large MNCs have progressively adopted an internationally
integrated approach to their inventive activities.
         In this paper, we provided a statistical investigation aimed at gaining further understanding
of corporates’ R&D internationalization, which has been increasing in the last decades towards
developing countries. From stylized facts of U.S. R&D performed by business enterprises abroad in
their majority-owned foreign affiliates, we presented our research question: what are the local
features that make some developing countries – like Brazil, China and India – more ‘inviting’ for
U.S. R&D captive offshoring?
         To present quantitative elements to answer the previous question, we proposed different
models. Our models’ results were pretty much in line with those already identified in the literature
on MNCs’ location choice decision; however, they extended it presenting additional considerations
and identifications of relevant differences of R&D captive offshoring determinants for developing
countries.
         Our study found that R&D investment cumulativeness, National Innovation Systems’
features and market size are important determinants to explain U.S. R&D captive offshoring in a
developing country. Notwithstanding that, our study revealed that international openness have no
statistical relevance for the same group of countries.
         It is necessary to say that each country may benefit differently depending of the type of
R&D undertaken and to the particularities of their National Innovation Systems. Therefore, even
with the increase of U.S. R&D captive offshore in Brazil, China and India, only a considerably
small number of affiliates seem to be performing relevant R&D that goes further beyond adaptive
R&D and only a few of these centers are integrated into the overall innovative strategy of the
multinational company. Still, even if R&D is integrated into global value chains, the benefits to
local society may not be reached if domestic absorptive capacity is low and if there are mechanisms
that do not permit the flows of tacit knowledge from those subsidiaries to indigenous companies,
affecting the national overall learning process.
         In order to contribute to domestic companies in host countries, subsidiaries should have
specific types of knowledge creation associated with investments in disembodied knowledge and
human capital (Marin et al., 2007). MNCs could have and exacerbated used of local incentives
provided by local government, generating loss of revenue, slacken of intellectual property laws and
employment policies socially burdensome (UNCTAD, 2005b).
         Finally, it is important to mention that attracting those investments is not per se going to
solve developing countries’ challenges to overcome underdevelopment. It may be important for
technological catch-up, once positive effect are likely to occur, however it does not mean national
companies will automatically benefit from MNCs’ R&D activities performed in their territories.
Domestic companies must enhance their absorptive capacity to benefit from external knowledge
from MNCs and governments can make efforts to improve their industrial and innovation policies
