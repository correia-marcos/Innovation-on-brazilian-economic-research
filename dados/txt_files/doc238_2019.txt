            Literature shows that horizontal inequalities in accessing more market-oriented un-
        dergraduate courses has relevant impact on inequality. This paper estimates heteroge-
        neous short term impacts of graduating in Brazil, a country with strong segmentation
        in the educational system. Using a panel data from 2017 and 2018, we explore the
        heterogeneity between public/private institutions, with a new database provided by
        Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Using a fixed-effects regression, it’s
        found that getting a undergraduate degree has an impact of around 10% on income
        over a year. We also find evidence that this increase is added by 7p.p. if one has previ-
        ously attended a private high school and a public university or college. Different kinds
        of institution of tertiary and secondary education also make graduating have distinct
        impacts on employment, formality and weekly hours in labor.

A literatura mostra que as desigualdades horizontais no acesso a cursos de graduação mais
orientados para o mercado de trabalho têm impacto relevante na desigualdade de rendi-
mentos. Este trabalho estima os impactos heterogêneos de curto prazo da graduação no
Brasil, um país com forte segmentação no sistema educacional. Utilizando dados em painel
de 2017 e 2018, exploramos a heterogeneidade entre instituições públicas/privadas, com um
novo banco de dados fornecido pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística. Usando
uma regressão de efeitos fixos, constatou-se que a obtenção de um diploma de graduação
tem um impacto de cerca de 10 % sobre a renda ao longo de um ano. Também encontramos
evidências de que esse impacto aumenta em 7p.p. se o indivíduo já frequentou uma escola
particular e uma universidade pública. Além disso, diferentes tipos de instituições de en-
sino superior e de ensino médio também fazem com que os graduados tenham impactos
distintos no emprego, formalidade e horas semanais de trabalho.

1    Introduction
Brazil, despite improvements in the last 20 years, remains a poorly educated country, even
compared to its neighbors. Among the largest countries in Latin America, only Colombia
has educational levels similar to Brazilian’s. The gap between its average years of schooling
and leaders of the region is around 25%.
     Although the strong role of human capital in wage formation in Brazil is consensual
[Langoni, 1973; Barbosa Filho et al., 2010; De Moura and Barbosa Filho, 2014], there is
little empirical evidence on the country’s labor returns of education. Griffin and Edwards
[1993] estimates from a mincerian equation the rate of return to an additional year of
schooling between 12.8 and 15.1%. Stefani and Biderman [2006] estimated a 28% increase
in wages with data from 1996. However, there is a general lack of estimates using evidence
from natural experiments or with emphasis on research design, with a credible causal
identification strategy, as described in Angrist and Pischke [2010]. Estimating returns to
schooling and college premiums in middle-income countries such as Brazil is an immediately
policy-relevant question.
     In this paper, we present causal evidence of educational returns on labor market using a
new short-term panel data (five quarters), with information on the institution of education
(whether public or private) after graduation. This way, we manage to perform a fixed-effects
regression of labor income on tertiary degree, interacting with a dummy of public/private
institution in college and high school. Our results show that, when graduating in college,
labor income increases around 10% in one year or less. Besides, if the worker graduated in
a private high school, there is an extra increase of 3p.p.
     This paper uses the data from the Brazilian National Continuous Sample Household
Survey (PNADC), a special survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics every quarter. Unlike many other surveys with schooling-related variables, such as
the Demographic Census, PNADC follows households for five quarters, making it possible
to identify residents from their date of birth. More specifically, the National Continuous
Sample Household Survey has a supplement on education in every second quarter, in which
surveyees were asked whether the institutions from which they graduated in high school
and college were private or public.
     Our paper contributes to the literature showing that, besides high short-term tertiary
education returns, there is another channel of inequality through institutional design in
Brazilian educational system, which reinforces previous segregation. We explore this chan-
nels, showing that, while public tertiary education institutions are better evaluated in
quality for most areas, students from private high schools tend to be more present in
higher return courses in those public tertiary education institutions.
     In our paper, however there’s an limitation: the lack of panel data in for more than
five quarters. This way, we may only estimate short-term impacts of tertiary education
premium on labor income.
     There are many economic benefits from which individuals with a tertiary degree are able
to take advantage, such as more likelihood to be employed, higher incomes on and even for
some health outcomes, such as less likelihood to suffer from depression. OECD [2018] shows
that relative earnings of workers with college degree is 150% above average upper secondary
education job wages, but without controlling on covariates. According to th institution,
these benefits vary widely with the courses. As an example, engineering, construction,
manufacturing, communication technologies students have the highest employment rate
on average across OECD countries.
     Moreover, there are researches exploring the relation between education and inequality.
Reporting socioeconomic differences in the United Kingdom universities, Crawford [2014]
explains what happens to different background individuals when they arrive at college ex-
ploring differences in university outcomes, such as drop-out, degree completion and degree

                                             3
classification. Higher socioeconomic background students are more likely to graduate, less
likely to drop-out the course and more likely to graduate with upper-classes honours (first
or 2:1) than those from lower socioeconomic background, even comparing individuals on
the same course. These differences in university outcomes can be explained by the fact that
these groups arrive at college with very different levels of human capital.
     Chetty et al. [2017] showed that access to college varies greatly by parents income in
United States, with children whose parents are in the high-income of the distribution more
likely to attend a college than those whose parents are in the low-income of the distribution.
     Davies and Guppy [1997] examine if there are inequalities in process by which students
enter lucrative fields of study, selective colleges and lucrative fields within selective colleges
in United States. They find that males are more likely to enter higher economic returns
fields of study than females; students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, although
do not have greater access to lucrative fields, are more likely to enter selective universities
and lucrative programs within selective universities; measured ability is a determinant of
student’s chances of entering lucrative fields and selective universities; and higher-ranked
schools and fields attract students who score greater on ability tests.
     Andini [2017] reports that "tertiary education for all" may not reduce the overall level
of wage inequality. Even that it reduce wage inequality due to differences in education
levels across individuals, it may increase wage inequality due to differences in unobservable
characteristics of individuals by favouring students with higher ability more than those with
lower ability. However, Brand and Xie [2010] find evidence suggesting negative selection in
heterogeneous economic returns to higher education in United States, that is, individuals
most likely to benefit from college education are the least likely to obtain one.
     Stratification and selection theories impose doubt about the effect of education on
inequality. There are many ways that education affects students. These private returns
vary among individuals and demographic groups. According to Hout [2012], Education
affects more those who are less likely to pursue a college education than traditional college
students, which supports the negative selection theory.
     Other papers examine the impact of education on inequality in Brazil. Arias et al.
[2004] showed that, although differences in human capital do not explain all of the racial
earnings gaps, they explain most of these. Differences in human capital are due to the more
favorable socioeconomic background of whites and to the fact that they tend to study in
schools with relatively better quality. Thus, the author concludes that equalizing access
to quality education, in addition to specific policies, such as anti-discrimination laws, may
reduce racial earnings inequality in Brazil.
     Giudici [2018] identified a great horizontal inequality in Brazilian higher education, i.e.,
students from less privileged social status tend to focus on lower expected financial return
courses. In addition, the author concludes that, although in recent years it has increased the
participation of students from less privileged socioeconomic backgrounds, high horizontal
inequality in college has remained.
     Reis and Machado [2015] report that labor earnings inequality is remarkable among
Brazilian workers with completed tertiary education. The authors explain part of these
disparities by heterogeneous returns across fields of study and mismatches between the
individuals’ occupations and their fields of study.
     Martins and Machado [2016] showed that the expected returns of careers influence the
choice of the highest quartile of per capita household income, while the competition in the
qualification process has greater impact on the choice of individuals in the lowest quartile
of per capita household income distribution.
     This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 there’s a brief discussion on Brazilian
educational system, its segmentation in tertiary education and, finally, the human capi-
tal theory and the alternative ways in which education impacts labor market outcomes,

discussing the literature on this issue, specially for Brazil. In Section 3, we present our
identification strategy, followed by a description in Section 3.1 of the data we used. Results
are presented in Section 4, while section 5 concludes.


2     Tertiary Education and Labor Market in Brazil
2.1   Brazilian Institutional Background in Tertiary Education
Attending public tertiary education in Brazil has always been the privilege of elites, since
their access has always been restricted and unequal. In 1992, for example, only 7.4 per
cent of whites of college age were enrolled, while blacks and browns were only 1.4 per cent.
In the last two decades, however the system of access to public universities underwent
profound changes.
    In 1998, the Federal Government created the National Examination of Secondary Ed-
ucation (ENEM), which became mandatory for accessing a scholarships program in 2004.
In 2010, ENEM also became compulsory for applications in SISU (Unified Tertiary Edu-
cation Selection System). The national quota system, created in 2012, completed the cycle
of these last changes.
    Currently, a large part of the selection process for public universities is done through
SISU, with 235 thousand vacancies in universities, institutes and federal technology centers,
a strong increase compared to the initial year (2010), where less than 50,000 vacancies were
available by that system. In order to apply through SISU, the candidates have to make
the ENEM and get a score higher than zero in writing. Some institutions require minimum
scores to accept candidates, while others give different weights for scores in various areas,
and others have mixed selection processes, combining SISU and their own entrance exam.
    At the time of registration, the candidate can choose between the system of wide
competition or affirmative action. Since 2012, 50% of the vacancies are reserved for students
from public high schools and, within these vacancies, there are quotas for low-income
students and for blacks and indigenous people.
    On the day that SISU registration is open, all students can enroll in the courses of
their choice by choosing two options in order of preference. At the end of each day, the
student has access to the cutoff scores for acceptance into his two chosen courses, besides
his classification in the first option. Also, the student can search the cutoff scores of all
courses in the system and can change their choices or reverse the order of their options
at any time. The final options are those recorded on the last day, when the system closes.
Then, on a given date, SISU announces the classified applicants in each course, that must
enroll in the tertiary institutions.

2.2   Evidences on Educational Stratification in Tertiary Education Sys-
      tem
It’s expected that undergraduate courses with a higher expected increase of income will
attract more applicants seeking educational gains. Figure 1 shows the minimum score for
acceptance by undergraduate course from public universities and the share of students from
private high school in these courses. The scores above mentioned come from the SISU.

                                          Figure 1




    This Figure shows that the greater the minimum score for acceptance of the under-
graduate course, the higher the share of students from private high schools. Since we may
assume that individuals compete more for courses with higher expected increase in income,
a greater minimum score can be seen as a proxy for higher expected increase in income.
    Carvalhaes and Ribeiro [2019], showed that, in Brazil, high school students from the
upper socioeconomic groups - that usually attend private institutions at that level of school-
ing - were significantly more likely to enter in higher return courses (Medicine, Dentistry,
Engineering, etc.) compared to students from the lower social status.
    Students may also use their Enem grades to apply for the "Prouni" program. Prouni
offers a full scholarship in private colleges to students who demonstrate family income per
capita of up to three minimum wages. Students who have scored at least 450 points in the
average of the Enem can be candidates for Prouni, in addition to a writing grade higher
than zero. Scholarships are awarded according to the grades obtained by students at Enem.
    However, in terms of evaluation, public tertiary institutions show in average greater
scores than private ones, for almost every undergraduate area. Figure 2 shows the average
grade difference in National Exam of Students Performance (Enade) between public and
private tertiary education institutions by undergraduate areas. Enade is a written, compul-
sory and annual test that evaluates the performance of undergraduate students in relation
to the programmatic contents, skills and abilities acquired in their training. The Anísio

Teixeira National Institute of Educational Studies and Research (INEP), which is a federal
entity linked to the Ministry of Education (MEC), is responsible to the test application.
Enade aims to follow the learning process and the academic performance of students in
relation to the contents of the curricular guidelines of their undergraduate course. The
Enade results report information by higher education institutions, academic organization,
municipality, state, geographic region and Brazil.

    As shown, in every area but two (Letters - English and Philosophy), average grade
of public tertiary students is higher. Usually, this difference is pointed as an evidence of
better quality of public tertiary institutions. Therefore, tertiary degree returns might be
higher when individual has studied in private high school and public university in Brazil,
due to its Educational System.

2.3   Evidences of Schooling Returns in Brazil
There are three primary channels by which education can impact labor income. The first
one is by raising productivity via human capital accumulation (see Schultz [1961] and
Becker [1994]). Not only does human capital lower cost of information acquisition [Rosen-
zweig, 1995], but also as workers acquire skills, experience and knowledge, a wider array
of what they can produce, and how efficiently, becomes available. Dustmann and Meghir
[2005] and Ashenfelter and Krueger [1994] provide some empirical evidence and rates of
return of education.
    The second channel is through peer effects, both at firm and sector level. As more
educated workers join a particular firm or sector, productivity for other workers rises [Falk
and Ichino, 2006]. This can happen either due to direct learning from other workers or due
to some sort of spillover effect, e.g. a recently-hired, more educated worker implementing
cost-saving measures at his or her firm, thus increasing the other workers’ and its sector
productivity.
    The third is through signaling [Spence, 1978]. The idea is that, due to labor markets’


                                             7
asymmetric information, high school diplomas, college degrees and other forms of education
certificates act as signals. As they’re costly to acquire, these credible pieces of information
make employers more willing to hire workers with more, better signals and also to do so for
higher wages. Hämäläinen and Uusitalo [2008] and Castagnetti et al. [2005] provide some
empirical evidence for this phenomenon.
    Overall, education has very well documented, positive effects on wages [Dickson and
Harmon, 2011] and positive externalities. Wantchekon et al. [2015] documents increases in
political participation and standards of living not only for more educated people but local
spillovers of the benefits (see Moretti [2004] for a comprehensive review of this topic).
    The strong role of human capital in wage formation in Brazil is consensual (Langoni
[1973], Barbosa Filho et al. [2010], De Moura and Barbosa Filho [2014]), and there is a vast
empirical evidence on the country’s labor returns of education. Griffin and Edwards [1993]
estimates from a mincerian equation the rate of return to an additional year of schooling
between 12.8 and 15.1%. Stefani and Biderman [2006], on the other hand, estimated a 28%
increase in wages with data from 1996.
    In most recent studies, Marcelo and Wyllie [2006], making a sample selection correction
procedure and including a measure for quality in education and a more direct measurement
of experience, finds estimates between 13 and 14%, with additional 26-27% when consid-
ering good quality education. Suliano and Siqueira [2012] estimates the rate of return to
education for two Brazilian regions that have strong socio-economic disparities: North-
east and Southeast, performing alternative forms of estimation of the OLS. They found
that returns to schooling around 5% in both regions, despite their strong socio-economic
disparities.


3     Methodology and Data
3.1   Data and Sample
All data we used in this paper comes from micro data of the National Continuous Household
Sample Survey (PNADC) of 2017 and 2018, by Brazilian Institute for Geography and
Statistics (IBGE). PNADC reports information about schooling, labor market and income.
Since the survey visits the same household for five quarters, it is considered a household
panel. IBGE publishes some additional topics in specific quarters of the year. We have used
the additional education topic, which is published all second quarter of the year.
    Specifically in this Supplementary Continuous PNADC, there is information on the type
of institution where individuals have achieved their last educational degree. Therefore, for
all Brazilians who have completed tertiary education, it is possible to identify whether it
was on a public or private institution. In addition, in this data set it is also possible to
identify the type of institution - public or private - where individuals got their secondary
education. This particular set of information allows us to estimate heterogeneous impacts
of a college degree on earnings.

3.2   Methodology
In this paper, the main aim is to understand how labor income responds to a tertiary
degree, regarding different types of tertiary and secondary education institutions attended.
So, our coefficients of interest will follow the equation below:

          ∂Y
                 = β1 + β2 × Private2Ed + β3 × Public + β4 × Private2Ed × Public     (1)
        ∂U niv
   Where Y is the log labor income (but it may also be employment odds rate, hours in
labor, etc...), U niv is a dummy for holding tertiary degree, P rivate2Ed is a dummy for

                                              8
holding a secondary education degree from a private institution and P ublic is a dummy
for holding anyone highest education level degree from a public institution.
    Following the equation above, the average treatment effect (ATE) of the tertiary degree
from a private institution for those who attended public high schools on their income will
be β1 , while for those who attended private high schools it will be β1 + β2 . In addition, for
those holding a tertiary degree from public institutions, having attended public schools,
ATE will be β1 +β3 and, finally, for those holding a tertiary degree from public institutions,
having attended private schools, ATE will be β1 + β2 + β3 + β4 .
    Despite the usefulness of estimating tertiary degree returns, our main interest relies
on β4 , for which we may attribute horizontal inequalities within public universities and
colleges. We consider that, for β4 > 0, these horizontal inequalities favour youngsters
with higher socioeconomic background, while β4 < 0 represents the case in which there
is progressiveness within these public institutions, favouring those who have not attended
private high schools.
    In order to estimate these coefficients, we perform a panel estimation technique, which
permits greater flexibility in controlling the effects of omitted variables that vary between
observation units and remain constant over time (and vice verse). Since Continuous PNAD
Sample have five continuous quarterly surveys for each household, we set our panel to have
the same individuals between the same quarter of two years, 2017 and 2018.
    Countinuous PNAD does not identify the individuals within households, but we use the
date of birth (among other variables such as gender) as an individual identifier, removing
twins from our sample. Therefore, we are able to obtain estimation results which derive
from the same sample in different years. Since our data set is made up of only 2 years,
however, we can only estimate short-run effects of schooling on wages.
    Our model has the following specification:

Yi = β0 + β1 U nivi + β2 U nivi × P rivate2Edi + β3 U nivi × P ublici + β4 U nivi × P ublici × P rivate2Edi + β5 Zi + ui + γi + σt + ui,t   ,
                                                                                                       i = 1,...,N;   t = 2017.II,...,2018.II
                                                                                         (2)
    where Yi,t is the log labor income of individual i in the time t; U nivi,t , U nivi,t ×
P ublici,t and Zi,t are a vector of observed individual characteristics, such as complete
tertiary education; γi is the individual time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity; σt is the
time fixed-effect, which controls changes that have occurred to all groups; and ui,t is the
individual time-varying unobserved disturbance.
    In our model, Zi includes age; age squared; dummies of the period of time in the last
job (when the dependent variable is not related to employment). We consider only anyone
born between 1996 and 1958 in our sample.
    Since we have only data for five quarters, one may interpret these estimates as the
signalling effect of graduating. The equation specification, with individual fixed-effects
combined with only tertiary education dummies, also reinforces this interpretation of re-
sults.

3.3      Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 shows some general information of our sample. There are around 40 thousand
individuals, younger in average than 40 years, with average 10 years of study (less than
completed Secondary Education). The standard deviation of Labor Income is higher than
its mean, suggesting a high level of inequality.

    Estimates show that getting an undergraduate degree increases significantly the indi-
vidual’s likelihood of being employed. This probability increases if this one has completed
his/her tertiary education in a public university. In contrast, having attended a private
high school does not affect the chance to be employed.
    The second regression estimates if an individual who get an undergraduate degree is
more likely to be employed as a public or a formal in private sector worker over a year.
    Our estimates show that an individual who completed his/her tertiary education in a
public institution is more likely to be employed in these positions over a year. In contrast,
having attended a private high, this probability decreases, unless there is an interaction
between a private high school and a public tertiary education.
    In our last logit regression, we test the heterogeneous impacts of graduating on the
odds of having o job in a occupational group with higher average income and stability. In
these groups are included managers, directors, among others.
    Besides the fact that getting an undergraduate degree increases the likelihood to be
employed in these occupational groups, estimates show an increase in this probability
associated to both private high school and public institutions.
    On table 4 we show fixed-effects regression estimates for short-run effect of tertiary
schooling on labor income.

    On our first regression, our estimates show that having a completed tertiary education
is associated with an labor income around 10% higher. Both β2 and β3 are not significantly
different from 0. β4 is positive in 6.8% at a 90% confidence level.
    The following regression, added all variables, shows a completed tertiary education
returns of 10%. The coefficient β2 , attributed to the interaction between completed tertiary
education and private high school, is not significantly different from 0. The same occurs
with coefficient β3 , attributed to the interaction between completed tertiary education and
public institution.
    On the other hand, the coefficient attributed to the interaction between completed
tertiary education, public institution and private high school, β4 , is positive in 7.1% at a
95% confidence level in default regression and at a 90% confidence level in robust regression.
    Thus, if the individual has attended a public high school and a private university, the
short-term impact of the tertiary education on labor income is 10%. The expected increase
is the same for one who has attended a private high school and a private university and for
who has attended a public high school and a public university. If the individual, however,
has attended a private high school and a public university, the tertiary education returns
increase to around 17%.
    The following table shows estimates for the tertiary education impact on weekly worked
hours.

    Results show that there is no impact on short term associated to getting a undergradu-
ate degree, unless the individual have gotten a degree in a public tertiary institution, having
attained private secondary education. In that case, our estimates point to an increase in
hours in labor.
    On table 6 we perform regressions to estimate the tertiary education impact on labor
income per worked hour.

     The results show an increase in labor income per worked hour around 10% associated
to getting a undergraduate degree. However, income per worked hour seems not to change
with the educational institutions on short term, that is, there is no additional returns,
on short term, associated to or getting a degree in a public university or have completed
secondary education in a private high school.
     One should notice that any impact on income per worked hour is probably due mainly
to signalling, since productivity hardly increases much in 5 quarters. So, tertiary degree
seems to generally increase income via signalling. However, the impacts on income of public
tertiary institutions and private secondary education on short term seem only to work
through hours in labor.
     As exposed, our main interest relies on β4 , for which we may attribute horizontal
inequalities within public universities and colleges. This coefficient is significantly different
from 0 when we use labor income as dependent variable, showing that, on short term, these
horizontal inequalities favour youngsters with higher socioeconomic background. Thus, our
first fixed-effects regression express the fact that there is little evidence suggesting that the
tertiary education returns is affected by the institution of secondary and tertiary education
on short term.


5      Conclusion
In this paper, we have examined the tertiary education premium for Brazil in 2017, using
data from the supplement of the Brazilian National Continuous Sample Household Survey

(PNADC), a special survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statis-
tics (IBGE) every quarter. We also have explored heterogeneity between public/private
institutions.
    We identified horizontal inequalities in Brazilian public universities, since private high
school students are more likely to enter in higher economic returns courses. Besides, stu-
dents from public universities have higher average grade on Enade than those from private
universities in most areas. Due to these results, we discuss the possibility of tertiary degree
returns being higher over a year when individual has studied in private high school and
public university.
    Using logit regressions, we identified that getting an undergraduate degree increases
the person’s probability to be employed, to be employed in higher income occupational
groups and to be employed as a public or a formal in private sector worker over a year.
Besides, in all these cases the likelihood is higher when the one has attended a public
tertiary education. In contrast, private high school increases the chance to be employed
and to be employed as a formal or a public worker, however it decreases the chance to be
employed in higher income occupational groups.
    Our first fixed-effect regression results estimate a β4 > 0, which indicates that horizontal
inequalities favour higher socioeconomic background individuals. As it’s possible to see on
table 4, our second fixed-effects regression estimates a β4 > 0, which confirms our first
result. It may evidence that private high school and public university students are more
likely to benefit from tertiary education on short term.
    Our estimates showed that holding an undergraduate degree increases labor income
in around 10% over a year. We explored horizontal inequalities in Brazilian universities.
Due to Brazilian Educational System, tertiary degree returns on short term is significantly
higher when individual has attended a private high school and a public university in Brazil.
    Summarizing, our results sustain two conclusions: first, there are horizontal inequalities
in Brazilian Educational System associated to the fact that private high school students are
more likely to enter public universities and that public tertiary institutions have a better
quality than private tertiary institutions. Secondly, because of these horizontal inequalities,
on short term labor market remunerates more workers who have attended private secondary
education and public tertiary education.
