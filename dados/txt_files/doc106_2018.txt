Resumo: Em 2002 teve início um ciclo de alta nos preços das commodities no mercado
internacional de forma concomitante à trajetória dos principais índices das bolsas de valores,
com destaque para as bolsas dos países emergentes. No Brasil, especificamente, o principal
índice de ações (Ibovespa) apresenta um histórico de composição importante de empresas
ligadas ao setor de commodities, o que sugere uma relação entre o preço das commodities e o
mercado acionário. Assim, o objetivo do estudo é avaliar o contágio de volatilidade entre o
preço das commodities e o Ibovespa, por meio de um modelo GARCH Multivariado, com o
objetivo de se verificar a possibilidade de diversificação de investimentos. A pesquisa tem como
hipótese o fato de que há uma forte relação entre os preços das commodities e o índice Ibovespa,
com a presença do efeito contágio de acordo com Forbes e Rigobon (2002), o que inibe a
diversificação de investimentos entre as ações que compõem o índice e as commodities no
cenário internacional. Os resultados encontrados corroboraram parcialmente a hipótese
formulada, já que foi possível observar um forte aumento da covariância condicional entre as
duas variáveis durante a crise financeira internacional. Por outro lado, a correlação condicional
entre o Ibovespa e o preço das commodities mostrou que a relação entre as variáveis é
relativamente baixa nos períodos anterior e posterior à crise de 2008, o que sugere que
investimentos concomitantes em commodities e Ibovespa constituem uma estratégia de
diversificação do risco, ao contrário do que comumente se supõe.

Abstract: In 2002, a commodity prices boom in the international market began concomitantly
with the trend of the main stock market index, especially in emerging stock exchanges. In
Brazil, specifically, the main stock index (Ibovespa) presents a history of important
composition of companies linked to the commodities sector, which suggests a relationship
between the commodity prices and the stock market. Thus, the objective of the study was to
evaluate the contagion of volatility between the commodity prices and the Ibovespa, through a
multivariate GARCH model, to verify the possibility of diversification of investments. The
research hypothesized that there is a strong relationship between the commodity prices and the
Ibovespa index, with the presence of the contagion effect according to Forbes and Rigobon
(2002), which inhibits the diversification of investments between the stocks that make up the
index and the commodities on the international scene. The results partially corroborate the
hypothesis formulated, since it was possible to observe a strong increase in conditional
covariance between the two variables during the international financial crisis. On the other
hand, the conditional correlation between the Ibovespa and the commodity prices showed that
the relationship between the variables was relatively small in the periods before and after the
2008 crisis, which suggests that concomitant investments in commodities and the Ibovespa
constitute a risk diversification strategy, contrary to what is commonly supposed.

1.   Introduction


         The increase in commodity prices in the international market since 2002, the sharp
decline observed during the subprime crisis and its impact on other markets, such as the stock
market and foreign exchange, constituted material facts in a highly integrated international
financial system. Interestingly, similar behavior to that of commodity prices was observed in
the main stock exchanges, especially exchanges in emerging countries. Changes in commodity
prices often exert an impact on the financial system through three large groups of investments:
futures, ETF (exchange-traded fund) from commodity companies and shares in companies
linked to the sector. An additional group can be included, since, especially for developed
countries, many studies, such as Kling (1985), have associated the effects on stock markets with
the oil shocks in the 1970s and shown that the rise in oil prices may be associated with a decline
in the stock market, given that the supply shock results, from the macro-economic viewpoint,
from the combination of recession with inflation. In Brazil, specifically, the main index of the
stock exchange’s shares (Ibovespa) has a history of important composition of companies linked
to the commodity sector, which suggests, in principle, an important relationship between the
commodity prices and the behavior of the Ibovespa. Despite the importance of commodities in
the economy and the trade balance composition, it can be said that in recent years, there was a
significant reduction in participation of companies linked to the commodities sector in the
Ibovespa composition.
         The contagion relations between the exchanges of different countries’ values have
constituted a recurring theme of research in the last decade. The number of studies on the effects
of US stock market behavior on various emerging countries has increased significantly. Some
recent research has included in the assessment of the contagion effect the behavioral effects of
oil prices and other commodities on the stock exchanges, mainly from oil-exporting countries.
However, little research has investigated the Ibovespa’s behavior in relation to commodity
prices. In this sense, the objective of this study is to evaluate the volatility spillover of
commodity prices on the international scene to the Ibovespa, through a multivariate GARCH
model, to verify the possibility of diversification of investments between the commodities and
the Brazilian stock index. The study is relevant because it allows considerations about the
possibility of diversification (or not) between applications in commodities and shares in the
Brazilian market. The research hypothesizes that there is a strong relationship between the
commodity prices and the Ibovespa index, with the presence of the contagion effect, which
inhibits the diversification of investments among the stocks that make up the index and the
commodity prices in the international scenario.
         Thus, the article is structured as follows. In addition to this introduction, section 2
presents the theoretical framework about the contagion effect and the transmission of volatility,
especially for applications to financial and commodity markets. Additionally, the section
includes a review of the literature on the behavior of commodity prices over time. In this
context, despite being a major exporter of commodities, the Brazilian financial market does not
appear in international studies, including those that sample mainly the oil-exporting countries.
Section 3 initially presents a description of the data used in the survey and later the econometric
methodology employed, which consists of using a multivariate GARCH model, which
originated in studies of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (the ARCH effect) in
univariate models, from the seminal work of Engle (1982). Subsequently, the volatility
univariate model was complemented with studies of the generalized models of autoregressive
conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), presented by Bollerslev (1986). Multivariate
volatility models developed following the work of Engle, Granger and Kraft (1984), and the
initial advances of this econometric modeling strategy sought to address some issues related to
                                                                                                 2
the overparameterized model and the consequent need for restrictions to be imposed in the
conditional variance matrix with the aim of reducing the number of estimated parameters.
Further, section 4 presents the analysis of the results and a discussion. Finally, section 5 contains
the final considerations.

2. Theoretical Foundation

        The research is based theoretically on the contagion effect and transmission (spillover)
volatility, especially research that has addressed the relationship between volatility variables
related to commodity markets and stock exchanges. In general, the literature on the topic has
addressed separately the contagion effect of so-called interdependence. Forbes and Rigobon
(2002), for example, defined contagion as an increase in the connections between two markets
when a country suffers some kind of shock. The infection is characterized, in that sense, as the
expansion of connections after the crash. The fact that the two markets are historically
connected is not characterized, by itself, as the contagion effect, but as the interdependence.
According to Forbes and Rigobon (2012), the connection between the two markets can be
assessed by the correlation coefficient. The contagion effect has often been approached from
the standpoint of volatility overflow, known as volatility spillover. The first studies on the
contagion effect used the stock market as a major field of study. The studies assessed the
existence of the contagion effect to identify the possibility of international diversification of
investments, following Park’s (2010) approach. Based on these concepts, Marçal et al. (2011)
evaluated the presence of the contagion effect or interdependence between countries through
the behavior of the stock markets, using a multivariate GARCH model, and found that, in the
analyzed period (1994–2003), a regional contagion effect was present in Latin American and
Asian countries.
        Overall, some research has sought answers to the questions related to the volatility in
commodity prices and to the strong upward cycle that occurred from 2002 until the subprime
crisis. Jacks, O’Rourke and Williamson (2011) evaluated the behavior of the volatility of
commodity prices in a study that included a period of 300 years. In a historical analysis of the
period 1700 to 2008, the authors discussed some stylized facts about the behavior of prices.
Although the purpose of the study was to compare the volatility of commodity prices with the
prices of manufactured goods and to assess the effects on the economic growth of the countries,
the authors demonstrated that the volatility of the commodity prices did not increase over time.
Nevertheless, the study pointed out that, throughout history, commodity prices have shown
greater volatility than the prices of manufactured goods as a result of the Industrial Revolution.
Finally, the study found that, in the 300 years of analysis, the effect of economic isolation and
war on the volatility of commodity prices was greater than the effect of global integration and
periods of absence of conflict. In other words, the authors found evidence that increased
integration of markets is an important way to reduce the volatility of commodity prices.
        As regards the increase observed from 2002 to the subprime crisis, Prates (2007) pointed
out that this behavior was due to a combination of factors, such as the global economic recovery
process, the devaluation of the dollar, the increase in global liquidity and the low interest rates
in the US economy generating a speculative bubble in the commodity market, and the Chinese
economic growth.
        Specifically regarding the effects of commodities’ prices on the stock market, various
surveys, using different econometric methodologies, have evaluated the contagion effect or
interdependence between the two markets. Arouri, Lahiani and Nguyen (2011) analyzed the
volatility transmission in 2005–2010 between oil prices and stock indexes in six countries that
make up the Gulf Cooperation Council (Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
Bahrain and Kuwait). The authors used a vector autoregressive model (VAR) combined with a
                                                                                                   3
multivariate GARCH model and found that only in three of the six countries was the stock
market significantly influenced by the oil prices. Nevertheless, the authors identified the
overflow of the volatility of oil prices and the stock market across the board.
        In another study, Teulon and Guesmi (2014) also evaluated the effect of oil prices on
the stock market of oil-exporting countries. The difference was that the authors used the stock
market data from four countries (Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait) plus a global stock market index to evaluate the effects of oil prices on these markets.
The authors identified an increase in volatility in equity markets before an expansion of
volatility in oil prices with a methodology similar to the that adopted by Arouri, Lahiani and
Nguyen (2011). In addition, similar results were obtained by Ghorbel, Abbes Boujelbene and
Boujelbene (2014) when evaluating the contagion effect of oil prices for 10 OECD countries’
stock exchanges.
        In another analysis, Basher and Sadorsky (2016) estimated a range of multivariate
volatility to identify the effects of oil prices on the MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International)
emerging markets. The authors extended the analysis to include the effects of gold prices, bond
prices and the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index), which is a volatility index that is based on the
options of the S&P 500. The analysis of the contagion effect between these markets was
intended to find a great hedge rate between assets and distinct indices.
        Specifically in relation to the Brazilian case, the investigation of the contagion effect of
applications has been directed more to the evaluation of the effects of stock markets, such as
the analysis by Righi and Ceretta (2013), which estimated the contagion effect of the stock
markets in the US, Mexico, Argentina and China on the Ibovespa using a multivariate GARCH
model. In the commodities market specifically, Margarido and Turolla (2014) evaluated the
contagion effect of oil prices on soybeans. The authors applied a co-integration model to
identify the presence of short-term and long-term effects and GARCH multivariate analysis of
variance for the series. Among the results, the authors identified the absence of the influence of
the volatility of oil prices and soybeans.
        The study by Vartanian (2012) sought to evaluate the contagion effect of commodity
prices for the Ibovespa and the effects of the US stock market and the exchange rate on the
stock index in Brazil. Through the use of a VAR model and impulse response functions, the
author found that increases in commodity prices have a positive impact on the Ibovespa. The
other variables, the exchange rate and the Dow Jones, also influenced the Ibovespa during the
period. However, the study did not assess the spillover of volatility between assets and/or
markets. In this sense, the present study is apparently the precursor analysis of volatility
contagion between the commodity prices in the international market and the Ibovespa.

3. Methodology
3.1 Data
        For the application of the econometric multivariate model, which will be presented in
the next subsection, the research used the daily data of two variables. One of the variables is
the Ibovespa index, collected on a daily basis in Economatica and converted into US dollars
from January 2000 to June 2016. The reason for the conversion into dollars was to match the
variables used in the estimation. The Ibovespa was included in the compound model for the
return, that is, with the logarithm of the difference, which is approximately the ratio of the rate
of change. The other variable, the CRB Index (Commodity Research Bureau), is a leading
indicator that reflects the prices of various commodities in the international market, such as oil,
natural gas, grains, meat, coffee, cocoa and precious metals. The index was calculated on the
basis of Bloomberg with the same periodicity as the Ibovespa and considered as an asset in the
sense of the return on an investment in commodities. The international financial market cannot
                                                                                                  4
be applied in any asset linked to the CRB, but there are a number of options that approximate
the return of the index. The CRB index was included in the model by compound return in the
same way as the Ibovespa. This means that the logarithmic transformation and differentiation
resulted in a series containing the daily returns of the CRB as if it were an asset. The fact that
the CRB contemplates commodity prices in the international market in dollars was the
determining reason for using the Ibovespa in dollars as well. Thus, the analysis consisted of
variables indexed in the same currency. In addition, it should be noted that on national holidays
and unavailability data of the Ibovespa and/or CRB, an observation of the previous day is
repeated.
        The use of the CRB was due to the availability of data and the frequency (daily) in the
search period, since other indicators did not show the same characteristics. Using the IC-Br,
which is the Commodities Index of Brazil’s Central Bank, on a monthly basis would be
inadequate due to the reduced number of observations available to estimate the econometric
model. Oil prices in the international market have daily data, but the fact that Brazil is not a
major exporter of oil and has a diversified export basket of commodities makes the use of this
indicator not as relevant as the use of the CRB. Thus, the CRB index
proved to be a better indicator with the frequency required for the purposes of this study.

        Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics and the results of normality test of the variables
used in the study. Although the estimation used the compound of the Ibovespa return in dollars
and the CRB index, it was decided also to present the descriptive statistics of the variables in
level, including the Ibovespa in Reais (local currency) in the first three columns. It is apparent
that the Ibovespa average in Reais, which is 40818 points, is more than twice the Ibovespa
average in dollars, which is 19522 points. Differences also appear in the median and in the
maximum and minimum values. With respect to the asymmetry, it appears that the Ibovespa in
real has negative asymmetry, while the same rate in dollars has positive skewness. A feature
common to both is excess kurtosis, which is a feature present in the financial series.
        Regarding the CRB, it is worth noting that the indicator is an index number (base
100 = 1960) and the relative volatility, measured by the coefficient of variation, is lower than
the volatility of the Ibovespa. With regard to returns, the descriptive statistics are presented in
the last three columns (R_Ibovespa (R$), R_Ibovespa (US$) and R_CRB). Thus, the
R_Ibovespa represents the composite return of the Ibovespa, calculated using the difference in
the logarithm of the Ibovespa. R_CRB was calculated likewise. In the return CRB series, it was
also possible to verify the excess kurtosis typical of financial series returns.

        As regards the coefficient of variation, which measures the standard deviation relative
to the average, it is observed that the return of the Ibovespa in dollars has the highest coefficient
of variation. In other words, the Ibovespa dollar series was more volatile than the CRB. This
can be observed in the minimum and maximum values. The Ibovespa had dollars in the period
with a maximum daily drop of 18.24% and a high daily maximum of 19.61%. In relation to the
CRB (R_CRB) return, the largest daily drop was 5% and the largest increase in the period of
the sample was 4.4%. Regarding the shape of the distribution, it can be noted from the
Jarque-Bera statistic that it is possible to reject the hypothesis of normality in all cases, which
was also to be expected in view of the presence of strong volatility in the variables, which
generates leptokurtic distributions.

        Besides descriptive statistics, we recommend observing the plot of the data in the
graphs. Thus, it can be seen in Figure 1 that the behavior over time of the Ibovespa and CRB
indices is quite similar. In the initial sample period from 2000 to 2002, there was a fall, and
since then both the Ibovespa and the CRB have experienced a growing trend, interrupted by the
international financial crisis of 2008. After the crisis, there was a recovery, and the CRB
exceeded the levels reached before the crisis, while the Ibovespa could not overtake it and
entered a downward trend. The same downward trend can also be seen in relation to the CRB
from 2011.

        Following the graphs of the variables used in the research, the log differences are
presented. The compound returns of both the CRB and the Ibovespa dollar demonstrate
common features in the financial series, such as the presence of volatility clustering, as can be
seen in Figure 2, which is compatible with distributions with heavy tails (leptokurtic), for which
traditional OLS estimates result in waste with non-normal distribution.
        Hereafter, the entire citation of the Ibovespa will refer to the stock index in dollars,
which was used due to the compatibility in terms of monetary units with the CRB, as mentioned
above. Figure 2 also shows that the international financial crisis, which originated in the US
mortgage market, triggered a sharp increase in volatility in both the Ibovespa and the CRB, as
the largest variations occurred in September 2008. These variations correspond precisely to the
maximum and minimum values of the two series presented in the descriptive statistics in
Table 1.


3.2 Econometric Model

        The main econometric model used in this article is the GARCH multivariate model.
Among the different possible specifications for the model, it was decided to use the BEKK
specification, developed by Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner, which can be found in the study by
Engle and Kroner (1995). The model description will be displayed in sequence, but it is
noteworthy that, before estimating a GARCH multivariate model, it is necessary initially to
estimate a vector autoregressive model (VAR model) and then to evaluate the cross-
correlogram of squared residuals and cross-products of the residuals with the aim of identifying
the possible presence of effects between variables.
        Thus, initially an unrestricted vector autoregressive model was estimated according to
the following specification:

y t = A1 y t-1 +....+ AN y t-N + Bx t +  t           (1)


where:
y t = vector of the endogenous variable
x t = vector of the exogenous variable
A1 + .....+ AN and B = matrices of coefficients to be estimated
 t = auto-correlated innovation vector

        Prior to estimating the model, following Elliot, Rothenberg and Stock (1996), an ADF-
GLS unit root test was applied to the original series and the return series composed of the CRB
and Ibovespa variables in US$. The ADF-GLS test is more potent than the recurrent form of
testing used in the literature, such as the ADF, Phillips–Perron and KPSS tests. Based on the
characteristics of the data, it is expected that the level series have a unit root and that the log
difference is stationary. To estimate the VAR model, lagged choices of criteria are used. The
choice of criteria is also based on the analysis of the correlogram with the goal of eliminating
all autocorrelation and therefore generating waste with white noise. Even though the waste has
white noise characteristics, the analysis of squared residuals and the cross-correlogram between
the two variables may suggest some kind of effect on the conditional variance. In this particular
                                                                                                 7
case, it is recommended to apply a multivariate GARCH model. The GARCH multivariate
models were developed from the univariate models based on the work of Engle (1982), which
introduced the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic model (ARCH model), and
Bollerslev (1986), which extended the analysis to the autoregression model of Generalized
Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity, which is referred to as the GARCH model.
Subsequently, Engle, Granger and Kraft (1984) extended the analysis to bivariate models. In
this sense, the evolution of univariate models into multivariate models can be seen based on the
literature review by Bauwens, Laurent and Rombouts (2006).
        Consider a series of multivariate returns {yt}, where yt is a dimension of univariate
returns vector N × 1. It is possible to write yt in each instant of time, such as:
       yt = μt(𝜃)+ et                                        (2)
where μt is the conditional expectation of yt, 𝜃 is a vector of finite parameters and:
                   ⁄
         𝒆𝒕 = 𝐻𝑡1 2 (𝜃)𝑧𝑡                                    (3)
          ⁄
where 𝐻𝑡1 2 (𝜃) is a positive definite matrix N × N. The vector zt has an expected value of zero
                                                                                                ⁄
and variance equal to the IN matrix, which is the identity matrix of order N. The term 𝐻𝑡1 2
represents a positive-definite matrix N × N, which can be obtained by Cholesky decomposition.
Additionally, it is possible to verify that 𝐻𝑡 is the conditional variance matrix of the vector yt.
       Specifying 𝐻𝑡 , which is the conditional variance matrix, is the object of study in the
multivariate GARCH models. A general formulation of the model, developed by Bollerslev,
Engle and Wooldridge (1988), states that each element 𝐻𝑡 is a linear function of the lagged
squared errors and errors of cross products with the lagged values of all the elements of the
conditional covariance matrix, according to the following expression:

       ht = c + A ηt-1 + Ght-1                               (4)
       where: ht = vech (Ht) e ηt = vech (et e,t)


         In Equation 4, A and G are parameters of the matrices of order (N + 1) N / 2 and c is a
parameter vector with (N + 1) N / 2 × 1. Already the vech notation represents an operator that
stacks the columns of the lower triangular part of an N × N matrix with (N + 1) N / 2 × 1 vectors.
The problem overparameterized is a characteristic of this embodiment, since, for example,
N = 3 estimates 78 parameters of the model. The adoption of some restrictions on the matrices
A and G can reduce the number of estimated parameters. Accordingly, Bollerslev, Engle and
Wooldridge (1988) proposed the diagonal VEC model (DVEC). In the DVEC model, it is
assumed that the matrices A and G are diagonal and that each element of the hi jt conditional
variance matrix depends only on its own lagged value and the previous values of the eit and ejt.
         Ensuring that the conditional variance matrix is positive definite requires the model to
be represented by applying the Hadamard product. In this type of operation, the product ij
elements of two arrays of identical dimensions, generates a new matrix in which each element
ij is the product of the ij elements of the original matrix. Thus, the model can be represented as:
                               ′ )+ 𝑜
        𝐻𝑡 = 𝐶 𝑜 + 𝐴𝑜 ⊙ (𝑒𝑡−1 𝑒𝑡−1 𝐺 ⊙ 𝐻𝑡−1                          (5)
       𝐶 𝑜 , 𝐴𝑜 and 𝐺 𝑜 are symmetrical N × N matrices given by the relationship
C=diag[vech(𝐶 𝑜 )], A=diag[vech(𝐴𝑜 )] and G = diag[vech(𝐺 𝑜 )], and the notation ⊙ represents
the Hadamard product. To estimate the variance and covariance, an exponentially weighted

                                                                                                 8
moving average (EWMA) template may be used, which was initially applied to univariate
models and then to multivariate VEC models in the following format:
        ℎ𝑡 = (1 − 𝜆)𝜂𝑡−1 + 𝜆ℎ𝑡−1                                                 (6)

        In the context of the DVEC model to estimate the variance and covariance for the
EWMA, the positivity of Ht cannot be guaranteed without imposing significant restrictions on
the parameters. The imposition of positivity was an evolution of the VEC model to the BEKK
model developed by Engle and Kroner (1995). In this context, the BEKK model
(1, 1, K) may be defined as:


                  𝐾                           𝐾
         ∗,                 ∗′                      ′
                        ′
𝐻𝑡 = 𝐶 𝐶 ∗ + ∑ 𝐴𝑘 𝑒𝑡−1 𝑒𝑡−1 𝐴∗𝑘 + ∑ 𝐺𝑘∗ 𝐻𝑡−1 𝐺𝑘∗                           (7)
                 𝑘=1                         𝑘=1



         𝐶 ∗ , 𝐴∗𝑘 and 𝐺𝑘∗ are N × N matrices wherein 𝐶 ∗ is an upper triangular matrix. Unlike the
VEC model, the parameters of the BEKK model have no relation to the values’ passed
volatilities or correlations between sets and thus constitute a special case of the VEC model.
Restrictions to the identification of a BEKK model with K = 1 are imposed on matrices 𝐴∗𝑘,11
       ∗
and 𝐺𝑘,11  , which should be positive, in addition to the diagonal elements, which should also be
positive. Aiming to reduce the number of parameters in the BEKK model, it is possible to apply
a BEKK diagonal model, in which the matrices 𝐴∗𝑘 and 𝐺𝑘∗ are diagonal. It is a less general
model than the DVEC model but ensures that the conditional variance matrix is positive
definite. By reducing the number of parameters estimated by the model and due to the fact that
it is one of the most used in the literature for contagion overflow volatility, the diagonal BEKK
specification was the application selected for this study.

4. Results and discussion

       Initially unit root tests were performed on the original series and the CRB index and
Ibovespa and on the returns series of compounds. As mentioned earlier, we performed the
ADF-GLS test, as the ADF and KPSS tests, although used more intensively, have a lower
degree of potency. In this context, Table 2 presents the results of the ADF-GLS unit root tests,
which confirmed the presence of a unit root in the level of the series and the stationarity of the
Ibovespa and the CRB in the logarithmic difference.

       Considering the series of variable returns, it is possible, by means of a cross-
correlogram, to assess any relationship between variables; the cross-correlogram between the
Ibovespa and CRB returns, shown in Figure 3, indicates the presence of the structure in the
conditional mean up to the lag. Therefore, we should initially model the vector returns through
a VAR model.

        Given the existence of a relationship between the daily returns of the Ibovespa and those
of the CRB, it is necessary to estimate a VAR paying special attention to the number of lags to
be used in the estimate, which should eliminate the serial correlation of the residuals. Due to
the characteristics of the CRB and Ibovespa series, for example daily, there is a serial
correlation structure that must be eliminated carefully with the inclusion of a large number of
lags. Thus, it was decided to conduct five tests using different criteria considering a model with
30 lags: a statistical test sequential LR modified with each error at the 5% significance level,
the final prediction error test and the Akaike, Schwarz and Hannan–Quinn criteria. The results
are shown in Table 3.
        According to Table 3, there was disagreement between the selected criteria. While the
Schwarz criterion pointed to the VAR (1) as the best model, the modified statistical sequential
LR test selected the VAR (28) model as the most suitable. However, after estimating a VAR
(1), which is a more parsimonious model according to the Schwarz criterion, we observed the
presence of serial correlation in the waste, which in turn was eliminated only with the inclusion
of 28 estimated lags. Therefore, the VAR (28) model, as indicated by the LR criterion, was
selected as the appropriate model.

        It should be noted that, despite the high number of lags, no overparameterized model
problem exists, given that the data are daily and make up a sample with 4301 observations. In
the VAR (28) model it was estimated 56 parameters and a constant. Thus, despite the high
number of parameters, the estimate was ensured by presenting a number of observations that is
more than 70 times the number of parameters. Figure 4 shows the model whereby effectively
the VAR (28) was able to eliminate the presence of serial correlation in the residues of each
series and in the cross-correlogram of waste.

       In the sequence the autocorrelation function of squared residuals of the two VAR
estimated model equations was generated. Additionally, the cross-correlation function of the
square of the waste VAR equations (28) was estimated. Both were in accordance with the
autocorrelation functions of squared residuals as compared with the cross-correlation of the
squares of the residuals of the VAR model estimated; Figure 5 shows that there is a structure in
the squares of the residuals and the conditional variance of the variables.

         In general, the analysis of volatility series and volatility spillovers (contagion effect) in
the context of the BEKK model is performed using the behavior of the conditional variance,
the standard deviation conditional covariance and especially the conditional correlation. Note
that, unlike other specifications, in the context of the BEKK model, the model parameters
cannot be interpreted in the light of past values of the volatilities or correlations between sets.
In this regard, Figure 6 shows, in the left graphs, the conditional variance and standard deviation
of the Ibovespa and, in the right graphs, the CRB index. Increased volatility is apparent in
several periods of the series, but the increase in volatility is very significant especially in 2008,
both in the Ibovespa series and in the CRB series. As expected in times of crisis, there is a
significant increase in the volatility of stock prices and commodity prices.
         In the context of the BEKK model, the analysis of the conditional covariance and
conditional correlation between two or more assets effectively allows the evaluation of the
contagion effect. In this sense, Figure 7 shows the significant increase in the conditional
covariance between the Ibovespa and the commodity prices in the period of the subprime crisis.
Some signs of increased covariance in 2007 can be identified, but this effect is more significant
in the last quarter of 2008, as shown in the graph on the left of Figure 7.

        Additionally, in the right graph, it is possible to observe the behavior of the conditional
time-variant correlation. The results indicate weak correlation between the conditional Ibovespa
and the price of commodities in the analysis period, as can be seen in Figure 7. Although the
height of the conditional correlation crisis has risen to about 0.60, which is expected in a
situation of increasing market volatility, the conditional average correlation of 0.20 in the
periods before and after the crisis suggests a weak relationship between the two variables, which
allows diversification of investment in commodities and the Brazilian stock index.

        In addition, the study confirms the contagious effect according to the definition Forbes
and Rigobon (2002), causing a significant increase in the conditional correlation in the period
of the subprime crisis. Thus, despite the weak relationship expressed by the conditional
correlation throughout the period, the expansion of connections during the subprime crisis
suggests the spillover of volatility.
        Despite the existence of the contagion effect, which has also been identified in other
studies evaluating the effects of oil prices on the stock exchanges of countries that export fossil
fuel, such as Arouri, Lahiani and Nguyen (2011) and Teulon and Guesmi (2014), there is a
weak correlation between the conditional and the CRB index of the Ibovespa, which ensures
investors the possibility of diversifying between the two markets. The weak conditional
correlation or weak relationship of interdependence observed during periods of absence of crisis
suggest that it is possible to diversify risks between the Ibovespa and the commodities, despite
the historical evolution of the stock index associated with companies operating in the sector,
but that lost considerable participation in the last decades due to the very dynamic evolution of
the companies and sectors that started to compose the Brazilian stock index.

5. Concluding Remarks

         This article aimed to analyze the effect of contagion or volatility spillover between the
Ibovespa index and the CRB index, which is the price of commodities in the international
market. The approach is justified, inter alia, by the assessment of risk diversification and the
perspective of investors, both active in terms of resource allocation. The importance of the
analysis is partly due to the strong relationship presented by the Ibovespa, both in historical
terms and in relation to the characteristics of the Brazilian economy and the commodity sector,
in view of the considerable weight of commodity companies in the index. It should be noted
that, in the recent period, the diversification of the companies and sectors in the composition of
the main Brazilian stock index has increased. To achieve the goals, a GARCH multivariate
model was applied for the primary purpose of identifying the contagion effect and conditional
correlation, which corresponds to the degree of time-varying correlations between the Ibovespa
and the commodity prices. Regarding the choice of the GARCH multivariate model, the
diagonal BEKK specification was selected due to the possibility to estimate a small number of
parameters and the fact that it has been widely used in the literature.
         The research partially supported the hypothesis initially formulated. The analysis of
conditional covariance clearly showed the contagion effect between the commodity prices and
the Ibovespa; after the subprime crisis, we observed a strong increase in the conditional

covariance between the two variables. Similarly, we observed that the conditional correlation
widened during the crisis, reinforcing the thesis of the presence of the contagion effect.
However, the analysis of the behavior of the Ibovespa together with the commodity prices
showed that the conditional correlation between the variables was relatively weak, reaching
approximately 0.2 in the periods before and after the crisis of 2008, suggesting that investment
in concomitant commodities and the Ibovespa is a risk diversification strategy, contrary to what
is commonly supposed. The results, in terms of the contagion effect, are similar to those found
by other authors, such as Arouri, Lahiani and Nguyen (2011) and Teulon and Guesmi (2014),
who evaluated the effects of the transmission of volatility between oil prices and stock markets.
On the other hand, and contrary to what was found in these studies, there was a weak conditional
correlation between the commodity prices and the Ibovespa, which translates into
diversification opportunities among stocks and commodities in periods of absence of crisis.
        Note that, especially from 2010, there was a more intense gap in the trajectories of the
Ibovespa index in Brazilian local currency and in dollars. In part, the most intense changes in
the nominal exchange rate constituted an additional source of volatility for the Ibovespa, which
may have influenced the conditional estimated correlation between the Ibovespa and the
commodity prices in the international market. This fact is one of the limitations of the research.
The estimated GARCH model with the Ibovespa in local currency could reduce the effect of
the exchange rate, but it would make the two sets incompatible, as the CRB reflects the
commodity prices in dollars. The second limitation is the fact that the CRB index reflects a
basket of commodities in terms of diversification. It is much broader than the commodities
related to companies listed on the Ibovespa index. Thus, the CRB index does not reflect
accurately the commodity companies present in the Brazilian stock index. However, there is no
availability of information on a daily basis that considers the commodities included in the
Brazilian economy. To solve the issue of the incompatibility of the commodities present in the
CRB and the Ibovespa, it is possible to estimate the presence of the contagion effect individually
from changes in the price of oil on the shares of companies linked to the sector and to assess
the conditional correlation estimated additionally. This can also be performed in relation to iron
ore and other commodities, with specific results in terms of risk diversification. Finally, the
study could be expanded with the application of different specifications of multivariate GARCH
models to compare the results of the estimates. Given the importance of the issues, such
possibilities should be included as topics on the future research agenda.
