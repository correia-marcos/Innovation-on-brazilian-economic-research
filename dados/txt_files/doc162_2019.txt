      Previous evidence shows that productive activity is not distributed randomly in space. In this
      paper we present a set of evidences about the service location patterns in the largest and most
      important metropolitan region of Brazil, the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR). Our re-
      sults are obtained from a measure based on distances and, therefore, not susceptible to MAUP.
      We found that 90% of service sectors have significant location patterns. In addition, we also
      provide evidence on local factors that are associated with observed locational patterns. We
      found that the greater concentration of human capital is related to higher levels of location.

1    Introduction
After two decades of intense empirical investigations, there is a consensus about the existence of a
positive relationship between the spatial agglomeration of activities and productivity (Combes et al.,
2012; Behrens et al., 2014; Accetturo et al., 2018; Gaubert, 2018). In fact, given obvious cost of
mobility and housing, for example, the own existence of very large urban agglomerations is difficult
to conciliate with the presence of rational decision agents without some some benefits from the spatial
concentration of activities and people (Puga, 2010; Duranton and Puga, 2014; Thisse, 2018). Two
associated branches of the empirical investigation in spatial economics still appear non-consensual,
however.
    First, although the recent contribution by Duranton and Puga (2004) in formalizing the micro-
foundations for urban gains (via sharing, matching, and learning), the debate about the particular
empirical relevance of each of these channels is still inconclusive (Krugman, 1991; Andersson et al.,
2007; Di, 2011; Wheeler, 2008; Overman and Puga, 2010; Abel and Deitz, 2015; Lychagin et al., 2016).
Second, apart of some evidence about particular sectors (Leslie and HUallacháin, 2006; Arzaghi and
Henderson, 2008; Klier and McMillen, 2008), not so many advances have been generated in order
to understand the spatial distribution of activities within urban centers (Kolko, 2010; Billings and
Johnson, 2016; Silva et al., 2019).
    Given the more continuity of the urban environments, this lack of rigorous information about the
spatial distribution of activities within urban centers was somehow justified, since the use of tradi-
tional measures of concentration proposed, for example, by Ellison and Glaeser (1997) are susceptible
to Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP) and, thus, can not generate reliable information about
the distribution of economic activities. More recently, however, treating the spatial environment
as a continuum of points, Duranton and Overman (2005) and Marcon and Puech (2009) proposed
measures of spatial location of activities based on distance between agents (firms or workers), the
so-called distance-based measures.
    Researches that uses continuous measures to document the concentration of productive activity,
however, are still scarce, since they demand geocoded information about the agents. But the literature
is consistently growing. Duranton and Overman (2005) themselves report levels of concentration of
manufacturing activities in the UK, Nakajima et al. (2012) and Inoue et al. (2019) provide for Japan,
Vitali et al. (2013) for a set of European countries, Behrens and Bougna (2015) for Canada, and
Aleksandrova et al. (2019) for Russian case. Note that most of these works focus on analyzing
manufacturing location patterns. Considering service and manufacturing sectors in Germany, the
main results of Koh and Riedel (2014)’s work show that 71% of manufacturing and 97% of services
have a significant geographic concentration. For France, Barlet et al. (2008) detected that 94% of
French service sectors as localized. These findings suggest that services may be more concentrated
than manufacturing, especially in large cities (Kolko, 2010).
    For Brazil, evidence on the spatial concentration is generally based on measures that are sensitive
to the MAUP (Silveira Neto, 2005; Resende and Wyllie, 2005; Lautert and Araújo, 2007; Almeida
and Rocha, 2018; Rocha et al., 2019), being the very recent work of Silva et al. (2019) for Recife
Metropolitan Region the only exception. The objective of this paper is, thus, contribute to this
emergent literature by providing evidence about the patterns of spatial location of services activities
in São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR), the largest urban agglomerated of Brazil. In this task, we
use geocoded data and the non-parametric method developed by Duranton and Overman (2005) to
obtain distance-based measures of location patterns of economic activities. Note that by dealing only
with services activities, we produce more reliable counterfactuals, since the statistic significance is
obtained by simulations of potential locations. But our research present another advantage compared

                                                  2
to the investigation by Silva et al. (2019): the focus on the Brazilian biggest metropolis allows
considering a higher number of services activities, since some activities are not present in Recife
Metropolitan Region, and thus obtaining a more complete set of information about location patterns
of activities.
    Our results indicate that 90% of the service sectors studied have significant spatial localization
patterns. These results are in line with evidence found for other countries with continuous measures
(Koh and Riedel, 2014) and also for Brazil with more limited measures (Domingues et al., 2006;
Maciente, 2013). We also find that the levels of location of activities are positively associated with
human capital, the degree of product differentiation, and with inter-sector dependence.
    The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the characteristics of our area
of study and the reasons that make the SPMR representative in Brazil and also in the world. In
the third section, the empirical strategy is presented. The last two sections present the results and
discussions and the final comments, respectively.


2       São Paulo Metropolitan Region Context
With more than 21 million inhabitants in 2018, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (IBGE), and constituted by 39 municipalities, the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR)
is the largest urban complex in Brazil and one of the largest in the world, ranking in sixth position
among the largest worldwide metropolis, according to a United Nations report of 20141 . Located in
the most populous and rich state of the country, by agglomerating around 10% of Brazilian population
in only 0.1% of the country territory (see Figure 1), the region is an unique Brazilian megalopolis.
    Being a genuine reflex of the Brazilian historical pattern of strong spatially concentrated develop-
ment (Baer, 2002), it is difficult to overstate the importance of the such great urban agglomeration for
the Brazilian social and economic realities. Actually, in addition to its very high population density,
around 2.7 thousand inhabitants per km2 , the region is recognized largely by its economic relevance
for the country. According to data from the Sistema Estadual de Análise de Dados (SEADE), for
example, its GDP of 2010 year (around R$ 701.85 billion) was equivalent to about 56% of the state
of são Paulo GDP and 20% of Brazilian GDP2 . In consonance, the SPMR is also responsible for pay-
ing a quarter of the taxes in the country and presents the most complex and diversified productive
structure of the country. The economic primacy is also accompanied by other distinctive features. At
least for Brazilian patterns, the SPMR presents a high Human Development Index HDI (0.794), it is
home of important universities (such as the University of São Paulo - USP), of São Paulo-Guarulhos
International Airport (the second largest in Latin America), of the most modern medical center in
the country, and of the official Brazilian Stock Exchange (Bovespa).
    Actually, the metropolitan region is part of the Macrometropole Paulista - MMP, a Brazilian
expanded metropolitan complex that comprises several metropolitan regions of the state of São Paulo:
Campinas, Baixada Santista and Vale do Paraı́ba and Litoral Norte, three Urban Agglomerations -
Jundiaı́, Sorocaba and Piracicaba and two Micro-Regions: São Roque and Bragantina. According
    1
     According to IBGE, the Metropolitan Regions and Urban Agglomerations are constituted by groups of neighbor-
ing municipalities and are established by a complementary state law, according to the determination of article 25,
paragraph 3 of the Federal Constitution of 1988, aiming to integrate the organization, planning and execution of public
functions of common interest. The list provided by IBGE also includes categories associated with these cuts: metropoli-
tan collars, metropolitan arches, metropolitan expansion areas, metropolitan subdivisions, among others. More details

to data from Companhia Paulista de Planejamento Metropolitano SA3 (EMPLASA), the SPMR is
the main region of the MMP. Most of the cities that form this large urban cluster are intensely
integrated and articulated, concentrating a series of diversified activities. Their performance have a
direct impact on the Brazilian economy. These characteristics make the SPMR territory an area of
strategic importance with potential to leverage state and national competitiveness, also influencing
the performance of Brazil in the international context.

    São Paulo, the main city of the SPMR and capital of the state of são São Paulo, is characterized
by being the main political decision-making center of the state. It has a diversified and specialized4
service center with emphasis on telecommunications, culture, education, health and transportation.
The region is a tourism and business center in Latin America, with around 74 thousand events per
year, attracting 4.2 million people (Costa, 2013). It is also a management center, hosting headquarters
of large transnational companies; an industrial complex, and a financial center.
    Table (1) presents descriptive statistics on population, employment, number of firms, CBD dis-
tance and diversity of economic activities by municipalities. The set of information allows a brief
but useful characterization of important aspects of the economic geography of the SPMR. From the
numbers of the refereed table, we notice that, although it is responsible for 56.40% of the population,
the city of São Paulo concentrates 71% and 69.52% of the total jobs and firms in the SPMR, respec-

    Previous evidence for Brazil shows that the externalities generated by locally diversified and specialized economic
environments are important to explain the spatial configuration of productive activity (see Silva and Silveira Neto
(2007, 2009); Fochezatto and Valentini (2010); Rocha et al. (2013) and Almeida et al. (2017)).

tively. In addition, it stands out as the most diversified city (measured by the number of different
economic activities). Note also that the further away the municipality is from the center (measured
by the CBD of the São Paulo municipality), both the less economic diversified and populous tend to
be the municipality. These characteristics are consistent with greater agglomeration gains closer to
the municipality of São Paulo.

    According to SEADE data for 2017, the economically active population of SPMR comprises more
than 11 million individuals (the largest in Brazil), 15% of which are employed in Manufacturing,
7% in construction and 18% in Commerce. By contrast, 60% of the population is employed in
the service sector, which shows how important this activity is for the functioning of the region.
Actually, in the SPMR are located most of the Brazilian headquarters of large industrial, commercial
and financial complexes. To meet the demands of firms and inhabitants, an intricate network of
increasingly sophisticated services was built, which is characterized by its deep relationship between

                                                         5
several sectors of activities, such as information technology, finance, consulting, and marketing. This
multiple network of relationships between people is characteristic of modern urban centers and vital
for the existence of cities.
    In this research we use geo-referenced information (complete address identified spatial unities or
geocoded) about formal firms using official information from the RAIS data (Annual Report of Social
Information) of the Minister of Labor and Employment. More specifically, from a total of 359,248
formal firms belonging to the service sectors from RAIS database, identified through the National
Registry of Legal Entities (CNPJ), we worked on a sample of 352,625 geocoded firms. Additionally,
in order to work on a reliable location information of economic activities, we restrict our sample to
firms with at least 50% of formality. Our final restricted sample, therefore, is composed by 332,705
geo-referenced representing the location of 5,086,035 jobs and 92.61% of the total RAIS firms. Figure
(2) presents the spatial distribution of these firms among the municipalities of the SPMR and Table
(2) sum up the procedures for adjusting the data set.

   Note that the set of evidence about the patterns of location of firms of different activities of
Services in SPMR is obtained by considering a 3 digits level of sector desegregation using the official
CNAE 1.0 (Classificação Nacional de Atividade Econômicas), a worldwide compatible classification
generated by IBGE. This is the common level of sector desegregation used in similar studies (Duran-

3       Methodology
As pointed out earlier, more traditional measures of concentration of productive activity are suscep-
tible to MAUP. In this research we use a measure based on distances proposed by Duranton and
Overman (2005) that overcomes this problem. The procedure for constructing this metric consists
of four steps.
    First, the pairwise distances of all plants in a service sector are calculated and we estimate the
density of their distribution. Second, we construct a counterfactual distribution assuming that the
plants of a particular service sector are located randomly among all possible locations. We use all
service sectors in the SPMR as counterfactual. Third, we define the confidence bands. The second
step is replicated 1,000 times – following Duranton and Overman (2005), for some specific sectors
tests of robustness with 2,000 and 10,000 simulations are performed – to build the confidence intervals
of 1,000 counterfactual K densities. Finally, we test whether a particular service sector has patterns
of location or dispersion or is randomly distributed, comparing the observed distribution of bilateral
distances with the confidence bands obtained in the sampling process. Below we detail each step.
    Firts step: Obtain the value of the index using kernel density estimation. Using our previously
described geocoded database, the distance between a pair of plants (i, j ) is initially calculated. For n
plants, we have n(n-1) pairs of distances. Using a kernel density function, the density of the bilateral
distances at any target distance can be calculated according to:
                                                    n−1 X n               
                                              1     X             r − ri,j
                                 K̂d(r) =                     f                                              (1)
                                          n(n − 1)h i=1 j=i+1        h

where i,j is distance between plants i and j ; h is bandwidth5 and; f is the the standard Gaussian
kernel function:                                                              !
                                                                            2
                                                1          (kxi − xj k − r)
                       f = k(kxi − xj k, r) = √ exp −                                          (2)
                                              h 2π               2h2
where xi is the reference point and xj is the neighbor.
    Following Silverman (2018), the ideal bandwidth for the Gaussian kernel function is 1.06sn−0.2 where s is the
    5

standard deviation of n(n-1) bilateral distances.



                                                       7
    The maximum of the kernel function is reached when the distance between points i and j are
equal to r and decreases according to the Gaussian function when the distance deviates from r.
    Second step: Counterfactual densities. Using our data set for all service establishments in the
SPMR, that is, we consider the location of all service establishments as possible locations for a pre-
determined sector m. For each of these locations, we randomly draw as many as the number of firms
in the sector m and we assign a firm of m randomly. We calculate the bilateral distances considering
the random draw and obtain the K-density. This procedure ensures that we are controlling for the
geographical location pattern of the entire service sector within the metropolitan area and for the
differences between the size of the sectors, thus allowing comparisons of location patterns between
sectors.
    Third step: For each sector m, we repeat the second step 1,000 times. This implies that for each
distance r, we have an estimated 1,000 K-density set. Following Duranton and Overman (2005), we
consider the distances from 0 to the median, r̄, of all bilateral distances in the sample. Additional
discussion and alternative ways to define the range can be found in the Behrens and Bougna (2015)
and Aleksandrova et al. (2019) works for Canada and Russia, respectively, in a regional context
considering the distribution of manufacturing across the country6 . Our analysis is then restricted
to r ∈ [0, r̄]. For each subdivision of the sample and each kilometers in this interval a K̂d(r) is
estimated. The lower K̂dlo (r) and upper K̂dhi (r) limits are defined as less than 95% of the K̂d(r)
estimated between K̂dlo (r) and K̂dhi (r).
    Fourth step: Identifying which service sectors are localized and which ones are dispersed. Any
deviation from the confidence band constructed in step 3 indicates the location or dispersion of the
firms belonging to the service sector in the SPMR. A sector m can be classified as follows:

   i) If K̂dm (r) > K̂dm,hi (r) for at least one r, the sector is localized.
  ii) If K̂dm (r) < K̂dm,lo (r) for at least one r and K̂dm (r) < K̂dm,hi (r) for all r 7 , the sector is
      dispersed.

       We can then define measures of localization (Γm ) and dispersion (Ψm ) for each r, as below:
                                                                      
                                Γm (r) ≡ max K̂dm (r) − K̂dm,hi (r), 0
                                                                      r̄
                                                                    X
                                      max K̂dm,lo (r) − K̂dm (r), 0 if    Γm (r) = 0
                                  
                       ψm (r) ≡
                                                                              r=0
                                                        0       otherwise
                                  

   From these definitions, we generate condensed indices that summarizes the information across all
r ∈ [0, r̄]:
                                        r̄
                                        X                                  r̄
                                                                           X
                                 Γm =          Γm (r)     and       ψm =         ψm (r)

   6
     Differently from Duranton and Overman (2005), Behrens and Bougna (2015) and Aleksandrova et al. (2019)
analyze large countries in territorial extension and, therefore, it is important to define an adequate range. For Canada,
Behrens and Bougna (2015) use 800 kilometers, and to Russia, Aleksandrova et al. (2019) use 1,000 kilometers. For
more details on the computational implementation see Aleksandrova et al. (2019).
   7
     When a sector shows peaks of concentration, it is possible that other points of the curve will fall below the lower
confidence bound as a form of compensation. This happens because the values are normalized to sum 1; it does not
imply dispersion.

    These last indices allow us to measure the amount of localization or dispersion of an industry with
a single value. A higher Γm (Ψm ) indicates a more localized (dispersed) sector m. These measures
allow comparisons between sectors, which in turn admit that sectors are ranked according to their
level of localization or dispersion.
    Finally, since K-density is a distribution function for sector m, we can calculate its cumulative
(CDF) for r ∈ [0, r̄]:
                                                  Xr̄
                                         CDFm =       K̂dobs (r)                                    (3)
                                                   r=0

   We can interpret the larger values of CDFm as indicating that sector m, for a given distance,
presents a pattern of greater geographic concentration. And, alternatively as highlighted by Alek-
sandrova et al. (2019), we can interpret this as the probability that two randomly drawn firms in a
given sector m will be distant from each other up to a maximum of r̄ kilometers.


4     Results
In this section, we present Duranton and Overman (2005) K-densities for 81 sectors (3-digits) of
services based on the CNAE for all SPMR and, then, discuss economic arguments associated with
the their patterns of location. Notice that, in order to obtain a reliable set of evidence, based on
the information from the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicı́lios (PNAD) of 2015, We only
consider the sectors with more than 50% of the total formal employment. For each sector of services,
we also compute local and global confidence bands based on 1,000 random permutations, as explained
previously.

4.1    Measuring Location Patterns
Our baseline results indicate that 90% of the service sectors in the SPMR presents statistically
significant location patterns. In order to illustrate the generated set of evidence, the following Figure
(3) presents the estimated baseline results with examples of location ((a) and (b) top two graphics),
randomness ((c) left bottom graphic) and dispersion ((d) right bottom graphic).
    The observed value of the index in the service sector is represented by the solid line, K̂dobs (r).
Upper and lower confidence bands are represented, respectively, by K̂dhi (r) and K̂dlo (r); these bands
contain 95% of the counterfactual distributions, so when the solid line K̂dobs (r) is between them we
can not reject (at the 5% level) the null hypothesis that the localization pattern of the particular
service is random. Remember that if the line K̂dobs (r) is above the upper limit of the confidence
band, the distances between firms are over represented in comparison to randomness, and this is
interpreted as a situation of defined pattern of location. On the other hand, when line K̂dobs (r)
is below the lower limit of the confidence band, the distances between firms are underrepresented
in comparison to spatial randomness, and this is interpreted as a situation of dispersion. In the
horizontal axis, the distances are represented in meters and its limit of 52.9 km (half of the biggest
distance between firms) was established following the suggestion of Duranton and Overman (2005) .
    Consistent with the importance of the principal CBD in the capital, Figure 3 (a) indicates a
location pattern of the Auxiliary activities of financial intermediation - CNAE 3 digits 671 - up to
approximately 10 km. This finding corresponds to the location pattern where firms are dispropor-
tionately located over short distances. Figure 3 (b) shows a similar location pattern for Wholesale
of personal and household goods - CNAE 3 digits 514 - located at a distance of up to 14 km. On
the other hand, Figure 3 (c) shows the location pattern of the Interurban rail transport - CNAE 3

                                                   9
digits 601 - where we do not reject the null hypothesis of location randomness. And, in line with
expectations, once it tend to follow the residential distribution, Figure 3 (d) shows the Ductwork -
CNAE 3 digits 603 - with dispersion at distances close of 10 km.

    Table (3) outlines the set of evidence and presents a summary of the results about the location
patterns for all the service sectors. We notice that only one sector was classified as a dispersed sector
and seven sectors as randomly distributed. On the other hand, the percentage of activities with a
clear location pattern (around 90%) is higher compared to previous evidence using the same location
measuring strategy. For developed countries, this set of evidence indicates that most of manufactur-
ing activities have patterns of geographical location (Barlet et al., 2008; Nakajima et al., 2012; Koh

                                                           10
and Riedel, 2014; Behrens and Bougna, 2015; Aleksandrova et al., 2019), but this percentage is never
achieved. For the service sectors, the evidence is scarcer. Our results, however, are in line with those
obtained by Koh and Riedel (2014), for Germany, and Silva et al. (2019), for the Metropolitan Region
of Recife. These last authors particularly found a higher share of activities with defined patterns of
location for Services (71.7%) than for Manufacturing activities (64.7%). The even higher share of
Services activities presenting a defined patterns of location in the current study may both reflect dif-
ference between the two metropolitan regions and the fact that these authors have treated Services
and Manufacturing activities simultaneously (what matters in contractual simulations). Anyhow,
notice that, unlike most of manufacturing activities, most of Service activities strongly depend on in-
teractions with customers (obvious examples are the financial intermediation and consulting services
that serve customers in different industries (Koh and Riedel, 2014)). As highlighted by Kolko (2010),
this characteristic not only tends to make these activities more urbanized than Manufacturing ones,
but also to restrict the spatial scope of its location determinants. These characteristics apparently
favor identifying location patterns for Services in a given urban area.

     Table (4) presents the 30 service sectors (CNAE 3-digits) with the highest value of the index Γm ,
i.e, the most localised activities, together with the value of Ψm for the unique dispersed activity. We
initially highlight the fact that most of these activities belongs to the areas of finance (for example,
Auxiliary activities of financial intermediation - CNAE 3 digit 671 and Other financial intermediation
activities - CNAE 3 digit 659) and commerce (for example, Commercial lease - CNAE 3 digit 654
and Wholesale pf personal and household goods - CNAE 3 digit 514) or involve using a higher level
of human capital (for example, Software consulting - CNAE 3 digit 722 and Legal, accounting and
business advisory activities - CNAE 3 digit 741). On the other hand, among the sectors in which
it was not possible to reject the hypothesis of randomness are retailing of used articles - CNAE 3
digit 525, car rental - CNAE 3 digit 589 and intercity rail transport - CNAE 3 601 digit present, for
example.
     Previous studies8 have also shown that the financial activities have significant location patterns
in France (Barlet et al., 2008), Germany (Koh and Riedel, 2014) and Brazil in the study of Silva et al.
(2019) for the Recife Metropolitan Region. The evidence obtained here, thus, confirms once more

    Using the index of Ellison and Glaeser (1997) for the US, the Kolko (2010) study finds that the service sectors are
also heavily concentrated.

a clear pattern of location for these activities within the Brazilian megalopolis. As for the group of
activities involving higher levels of human capital, similar results were also obtained by Billings and
Johnson (2016), for the Denver-Boulder-Greeley metropolitan area, and Silva et al. (2019). We notice
that this group includes very different kinds of services (for example, Architectural and engineering
services and specialized technical advice - CNAE 3 digit 742 and Health care - CNAE 3 digit 851), a
fact that suggests the role of human capital for their location patterns. Interestingly, both groups of
activities tend to present defined location patterns at short distances: while for the financial activities
the average (among activities of the group) maximum distance for a observed location pattern is 10.2
km, for human capital based activities the same average distance is 13.0km.
    The activities of commerce presenting a clear location pattern include both retail and wholesale
activities (for example,Wholesale pf personal and household goods - CNAE 3 digit 514 and Non-
specialized retail - CNAE 3 digit 521). In both situations, note that they involve a great variety of
differentiated products and, thus, they location patterns may act reducing research and transport
costs for consumers and bringing demand externalities for firms of differentiated products (Konishi,
2005). Similar results were also obtained by Silva et al. (2019) for the metropolitan region of Recife.
Notice also that for this group of activities the average maximum distance for a observed location
pattern is longer (about 29.2km) than for the aforementioned activities, suggesting less importance
for geographic proximity.
    Note that the location patterns observed in Table (4) through the index Γm inform about the
existence and relative relevance of a location pattern of firms in different economic activities, but
not directly about their geographic concentration levels. The results in Table (5) which presents
the ranking of the sectors with the 30 activities with the largest CDFm bring this information by
registering the probability that two randomly drawn firms of a given sector would be distant form
each other up to 52.9 km. Interestingly, these new results indicate that, in general, the most strongly
localized service economic activities are also the most agglomerated (Aleksandrova et al., 2019). In
addition, note, particularly, that half of all activities belongs to finance or services involving higher
human capital.

4.2    Characterizing services location patterns in SPMR
In this subsection, we present evidence about economics forces associated with the patterns of location
of service sectors in the SPMR using simple multivariate regressions. Far from obtaining causal
relationships, something not allowed by our dataset, we simply look for theoretical based associations
between the identified patterns of location of firms and economic arguments. Briefly, these economic
arguments for understanding firms location patterns derives both from traditional location theories
and sources of urban agglomeration gains.
    The patterns of location of firms, according to locational theory arguments, are associated both
with the conditions of spatial competition and product differentiation and consumer externalities
(Hotelling, 1929; Clark, 2002; Konishi, 2005; Fujita and Thisse, 2013), product differentiation turns
price competition weaker allowing spatial proximity for firms that compete with each other. As
argued by Konishi (2005), consumer externalities turn stronger this possibility. More recently, Billings
and Johnson (2016) highlighted that consumer shop time regularity also matter for the firms patterns
of location, once product and services that impose more frequent and regular shops tend to locate
nearer residences.
    But firms location patterns in an urban context can also be influenced by the possibility of
urban agglomeration gains (Ciccone and Hall, 1996; Acemoglu and Angrist, 2000; Glaeser and Mare,
2001; Moretti, 2004; Fu, 2007; Greenstone et al., 2010; Duranton, 2016; Chauvin et al., 2017; Dingel

et al., 2019). These gains can arise both from spatial proximity to services and inputs offers (better
sharing) and from spatial proximity to similar activities involving technological spillovers and learning
(typically, activities involving higher levels of human capital).
    In order to capture part of these arguments, based on available information, we built indicators of
product differentiation, human capital and vertical integration (linkages) for each economic activity.
For the product differentiation, we built the proxy proposed by Silva et al. (2019). The index is
based on the sector differentiation of the structure of occupation, being defined by:
                                                Nm X H

where Nm is the number of firms of service sector m; Hm is the number of kinds of occupations of
service sector m; ymik corresponds to the share of occupation k in the total kinds of occupation of
firm i of service sector m; and ȳmk is the average shares of occupations k of service sector m. The
index capture the idea that the more differentiated the service within the sector, the more diverse
is its occupational structure. More specifically, for example, both here for SPMR and in Silva et al.
(2019), we get the fuel retail trading activity (an activity known by its homogeneous product) with
very low indicator.
     Notice that the influence of product differentiation on location patterns of firms may depend of the
level of differentiation itself (while homogeneous or weakly differentiated products may brings price
competition, extremely differentiated products has no impact on firms’ location patterns). Thus,
similarly to Silva et al. (2019), in the following econometric specification, we allow for a non-linear
association between product differentiation and the location patterns of firms.
     We also use he percentage of workers with at least one college in the degree in the sector,
collegem , to measure its intensity of human capital using. This represents the potential of tech-
nological spillovers and learning of the sectors and, thus, may influence the location choices of firms
of the sectors (Ciccone and Hall, 1996; Acemoglu and Angrist, 2000; Glaeser and Mare, 2001; Moretti,
2004; Fu, 2007; Greenstone et al., 2010; Duranton, 2016; Chauvin et al., 2017; Dingel et al., 2019).
     In line with the arguments that the sharing of suppliers and inputs can favor the agglomeration
of firms, we use the ratio of the number of different occupations per firm of the sector as an indicator
of its vertical integration level, Sharem . Because this indicator can also vary according to the size of
the firms, we also use an indicator for the firms size (number of workers per firm),Workers/firmm .
     Finally, following Koh and Riedel (2014) and Silva et al. (2019), we also use the mean age of the
workers, Agem as a control variable to capture potential influences arising from different conditions
of workers’ mobility or differentiated demographic patterns across economic activities.
     Formally, we estimate the influence of these factors through the following equation:

        Γm = θ + β1 collegem + β2 Sharem + β3 Dm + β4 D2m + β5 Agem + β6 Workers/firmm + m             (5)

where Γm is the location index for service sector and m is an error term.
    Table (6) presents the results of the estimates of equation (5) by ordinary least squares (OLS).
Except for the differentiation index (for which we explore non-linear effects), the variable are used in
log. forms since it facilities interpretation and reduce the number of decimal cases of the estimated
coefficients. In the columns of (I) to (III) we present simple association specifications, that is,
considering each of the explanatory variables previously described separately. In columns (IV) and
(V) we consider the three indicators together, respectively, without and with the controls variables.
    We note that the estimated coefficient for the variable collegem (column (I)) is positive and
statistically significant, indicating that the patterns of location of service sectors are associated with
the share of skilled workers. Note that this result is robust across different multivariate specifications.
Thus, the evidence, also obtained also by Koh and Riedel (2014) and Silva et al. (2019), suggests that
location patterns of firms are positively influenced by the human capital involved, a result consistent
with the importance of technological spillovers and learning within them.
    Note also, that, although the results from columns (II) and (III) for individual associations, re-
spectively, for vertical integration and differentiation indicators do not present statistical significance,
they present expected signals. Furthermore, the effects appear statistical significant when more vari-
ables are included (columns (IV) and (V)). More specifically, from both columns (IV) and (V), we
observe a negative association between the degree of vertical integration and the firms location pat-
tern, suggesting that more interdependence positively affect it. Again, this result is line with the

evidence provided by Silva et al. (2019) and Behrens and Bougna (2015) and is consistent with the
importance of proximity to services and inputs offers.
    The estimated parameters associated with our proxy for differentiated products (Dm ) was positive
for the linear variable and negative for the quadratic one. These results suggest that product dif-
ferentiation positively affect the spatial pattern of location of firms for lower levels of differentiation
and has none or negative effects for higher levels of differentiation. Again, the results are similar to
those obtained by Silva et al. (2019) and perfectly consistent with the the trade-off highlighted by the
location theory (Fujita and Thisse, 2013): product differentiation may turn weaker price competition
effect, but this attenuation matters more for less differentiated products.

5     Conclusion
We present a detailed analysis of the firms location patterns of the service sectors in the SPMR, the
largest Brazilian metropolitan region and one of the biggest worldwide urban agglomeration. The
set of evidence was obtained using geocoded information and a distance-based measure that allowed
us to overcome one of the main problems of traditional concentration measures, MAUP. In addition,
in an exploratory way, the research presented evidence about the economic arguments that may be
associated to the identified localization patterns.
    We highlight three general aspects about this set of evidence about the patterns of distribution
of service activities in SPMR:

    i) Most of the service sectors analyzed (around 90%) present a deviation from the random pattern,
       indicating a defined location pattern. This result is in line with the models of formation of cities

                                                    16
      that indicate that more specialized sectors are more productive when concentrated spatially
      close (Combes et al., 2012; Behrens et al., 2014; Accetturo et al., 2018; Gaubert, 2018).
  ii) Financial and human capital based activities present location patterns at short distances, in-
      dicating their spatial agglomeration tendencies. These results confirm previous evidence in
      different contexts (Koh and Riedel, 2014; Silva et al., 2019). On the other hand, the activities
      of commerce presenting tend present location patterns at average distances, what is consistent
      with the relevance of proximity to residences.
 iii) Our evidence about the economic arguments associated with the observed location patterns
      suggests that these defined patterns are positively associated with human capital, the degree
      of product differentiation, and with inter-sector dependence localization of firms over shorter
      distances. Thus, this exploratory set of evidence is consistent with both the relevance of
      learning and sharing sources of agglomeration gains and with spatial competition arguments
      of traditional location theory.
    However, much is still necessary for deeper understanding of location patterns in Brazilian urban
centers. First, no evidence is available about about the the patterns of joint location between pairs
of different economic activities. Second, obviously, much work and energy are necessary in order to
effectively explain the identified location patterns (maybe using policy historical experiments). Both
directions, actually, are in our research agenda.
