    Abstract: Do external shocks to the economy affect the electoral fortunes of incumbents? Drawing
data from Brazilian municipal elections, this paper shows that while increases in the price of agricul-
tural commodities greatly enhance the probability of reelection of incumbent mayors, negative shocks
place them at an incumbency disadvantage vis-à-vis challengers. Coupling a measure of exogenous price
volatility for each municipality with a “close election” regression discontinuity design, we rule out alter-
native explanations pointing to differences in incumbents and challengers, strategic candidate entry and
exit, or structural differences across municipalities. Furthermore, we show that commodity inflation is
particularly consequential in rural municipalities, and that the electoral success of incumbents only re-
sponds to inflation during the last year of an incumbent’s term. By showing that voters cannot adequately
distinguish exogenous factors from incumbents’ actions nor evaluate performance during a full incumbent
term, we contribute to the growing evidence on the limitations of retrospective voting. We also underscore
that exposure to adverse economic shocks, which afflicts many developing economies, may represent a
heretofore unrecognized failure of democratic accountability.
    Resumo: Choques externos influenciam o desempenho de políticos no exercício do mandato? Através
de dados de municípios brasileiros, este artigo mostra que um aumento no preço internacional de com-
modities agrícolas aumenta a probabilidade de reeleição de prefeitos, e choques negativos os coloca em
desvantagem em relação aos seus competidores. Combinando uma medida de volatilidade de preços in-
dividual para cada município e um desenho de regressão descontínua, descartamos hipóteses alternativas,
como diferenças entre competidores, diferenças estruturais entre municípios ou entrada e saída estratégica
de candidatos. Mostramos que inflação de preço das commodities é extremamente relevante para resul-
tados eleitorais, mas também que eleitores só respondem a choques no último ano de mandato de seus
prefeitos. Ao mostrar que eleitores são incapazes de distinguir entre sorte e competência, e também se
mostram míopes na sua capacidade de analisar sinais da economia, contribuímos à crescente literatura
que mostra limites na capacidade do eleitor em votar retrospectivamente e de maneira racional. Também
mostramos que exposição a choques econômicos adversos, comum à países em desenvolvimento, diminui
o accountability democrático. JEL: D72.


1        Introduction
Retrospective voting is at the heart of normative and descriptive theories of democracy. By deciding
whether the incumbent should remain in office on the simple basis of past performance, voters are able
to select the best candidates and/or generate incentives for good performance (Achen and Bartels 2014).

Abundant cross-national evidence suggests that voters use this type of retrospective rule across various
political settings (Fiorina 1981; Duch and Stevenson 2008). The democratic efficacy of retrospective
voting, however, has been cast into doubt by recent studies showing that voters often make attribution
errors in their evaluations of incumbent performance (Healy and Malhotra 2013). Studies of US elections
have documented that, for example, voters blame incumbents for ostensibly exogenous events, such as
shark attacks and flu outbreaks.3 Outside the US, a study of Latin American democracies by Campello
and Zucco (2014) shows that factors exogenous to leaders’ decisions, such as commodity prices and
foreign interest rates, have considerable effects on presidential popularity and reelection rates. If voters
hold incumbents accountable for outcomes politicians cannot influence or control, elections may not be
selecting the best candidates for office.
    Empirically discerning attribution errors in retrospective evaluations requires disentangling merit from
luck. In the realm of economic voting, since incumbents can influence the economy, it is difficult to estab-
lish if leaders are responsible or if exogenous factors determine economic outcomes. Scholars commonly
address this problem by evaluating the electoral impact of external sources of economic volatility, which
is presumed exogenous of incumbents’ actions. The decisions incumbents take, however, can influence
global markets, or, at the very least, shape the domestic effects of external shocks. This is especially likely
in presidential elections, the primary focus of existing studies on misattribution. Presidents have ample
resources and political incentives to affect worldwide economic variables. For example, a market-oriented
incumbent party is more likely to expose the domestic economy to international financial volatility than
parties with a protectionist agenda. Economic shocks may not be exogenous at all if shocks afflict coun-
tries whose incumbents shape policy according to their political platforms. In such cases, voting to keep
or remove incumbents from power based on the international economy can be all but rational.4 Another
inferential problem is that some countries are more sensitive to international shocks than others.
    We address these issues by exploiting exogenous variation on two factors that are critical for retrospec-
tive voting: economic volatility and incumbency. We assess the impact of agricultural international price
volatility on Brazilian municipalities one year before each mayoral electoral cycle. Our key independent
variable is an index of agricultural commodity inflation, measured as the change in agricultural prices
weighted by the importance each crop had in the past on each municipality. Mayors have limited microe-
conomic latitude to influence their local economy, and have no macroeconomic tools to protect themselves
   3
      The relationship between exogenous events and retrospective evaluations is the subject of a growing research agenda on
misattribution. See Achen and Bartels (2002); Healy and Malhotra (2009); Healy, Malhotra and Mo (2010); Healy and Malhotra
(2010).

      Past political decisions affect how an economy responds to future shocks. For example, oil producing countries set mech-
anisms to cope with lower prices. Norway, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE) have established sovereign funds
to hedge against short-term price volatility. UAE has produced a fund of around 10 thousand dollars per capita. Other oil
producing countries have not opted to established large funds, or domestic constrains prevented them from forming a large
purse. Still, despite several international sanctions, Iran’s sovereign fund covers around 800 dollars per capita. On the other
hand, Venezuelan sovereign fund has saved mere 27 dollars per capita. Even if oil prices had fallen for exogenous reasons (due
to, for example, the advent of fracking technology), the economic and social woes of an oil-producing country are in large part
a result of past decision of their incumbents.

against economic shocks. Mayors have even less leverage to influence the economy one year before the
elections. As a further empirical safeguard, we employ a “close election” regression discontinuity design
to rule out the possibility that certain types of incumbents are more likely to take actions that encourage
or mitigate external shocks.
    Results show that incumbents’ electoral prospects are highly sensitive to exogenous price shocks. In
comparison to challengers, incumbent candidates do not appear to run more or less often as a result of
international price volatility, but have significantly higher probability of winning the subsequent election.
This effect is stronger in rural economies, where commodities represent a a larger fraction of the total
income. We also uncover that mayors in rural municipalities suffer from an incumbency disadvantage,
which can only be mitigated by an exceptionally positive price shock. Consistent with research on U.S.
presidential elections, voters appear to be myopic, and only respond to the volatility during electoral years
(Achen and Bartels 2004; Bartels 2008; Huber, Hill and Lenz 2012; Healy and Lenz 2014).
    This paper makes various contributions to the literature on democratic accountability. We identify
economic volatility as a contextual factor that can lead voters to mistakenly keep or oust politicians from
office. Since emerging economies are more exposed to short-term hardships and bonanzas (Pritchett 2000),
our research suggests that elections may offer a weaker instrument of accountability in developing than
in advanced democracies. Empirically, jointly leveraging commodity shocks and a subnational research
design provides a more solid basis of identification than studies based on presidential elections.
    This paper is organized in seven sections. Section 2 provides a background on retrospective voting in
Brazilian mayoral elections and motivates the plausibility of misattribution as a a potentially systematic
blessing or curse for incumbents. Section 3 outlines our research design, including our strategy to measure
exogenous commodity inflation and its impact on elections, and also conducts robustness checks for our
design. Section 4 presents the main results concerning the impact of commodity inflation on incumbency
effects. Section 5 investigates whether inflation affects elections through GDP growth and Section 6
evaluates whether voters respond to inflation myopically. Section 7 concludes by summarizing our main
findings and drawing the implications of our findings for democracy.


2    Brazilian Mayoral Elections: Commodity Shocks, Retrospective
     Voting and Incumbent Vulnerability
There is substantial evidence suggesting that the electoral success of Brazilian presidents, deputies, gov-
ernors, and mayors is associated with their performance in office (Pereira and Rennó 2003, 2007; Pereira,
Melo and Figueiredo 2009; Pereira and Melo Forthcoming; Zucco 2010). The prevalence of retrospective
voting makes Brazilian elections a fertile setting to study whether voters can correctly attribute incumbent
responsibility for observed performance. We focus on mayoral elections, which not only provide rich vari-
ation in electoral outcomes across 5,564 municipalities. Moreover, municipalities are exposed to external
economic shocks that are arguably orthogonal to incumbents’ actions. Taking advantage of the crucial
role of agriculture in Brazilian municipalities, and the negligible influence mayors have over international

commodity prices, we can investigate if exogenous price shocks influence voting behavior or if, instead,
voters can correctly separate merit from luck.
    Local politics play a key role in Brazilian political and policy arenas. Unlike most federations, the
Brazilian Constitution recognizes municipalities as constitutional entities, with the same institutional sta-
tus of states. Furthermore, municipalities are responsible for the social services that most directly influence
the welfare of Brazilian citizens, such as health, primary education, inner-city public transportation, and
land use. Given the importance of Brazilian municipalities, performance in office is central for voters to
decide in whom they should vote.5 The salience of performance evaluations is exacerbated by the weak-
ness of Brazilian local parties.6 Local party organizations are autonomous from party upper branches, and
mayors run personalistic campaigns (Codato, Cervi and Perissinotto 2013; Novaes 2014). Local coalitions
are oversized and ideologically diffuse, diluting national party reputations in municipal elections (Dantas
2007; Lavareda and Telles 2011).7
    The existing literature on retrospective voting in Brazilian mayoral elections has focused on anti-
incumbent retrospective voting. Some scholars attribute this behavior to corruption. In an influential arti-
cle, Ferraz and Finan (2011) show that Brazilian mayors are electorally punished for administrative irreg-
ularities disclosed before elections.8 Titiunik (2008) and Klašnja and Titiunik (2014) argue that corruption
is so widespread that voters systematically oust mayors from office, leading to a structural incumbency
disadvantage. This speculation is bolstered by evidence that, in fact, incumbent mayors have lower odds
of winning an election than challengers. Another perspective on retrospective voting contends that the
fortunes of Brazilian mayors show wide subnational variability, and that it is rooted in fiscal constraints.
Consistent with this hypothesis, there is evidence showing that differences in access to fiscal resources sys-
tematically shapes incumbent performance, placing some mayors at an incumbency advantage and others
at an incumbency disadvantage (Schiumerini 2015).9
   5
      Municipal governments are separated between an executive branch headed by the mayor, and a local council primarily
tasked with legislative oversight. In municipalities with less than 200,000 registered voters, mayors are selected using single-
member district plurality rules; in municipalities with more than 200,000 registered voters, mayors are selected using majority
rules with a potential runoff. Local councilors are selected with open-list proportional representation using the d’Hondt formula.
Mayors serve for four-years and are allowed to run one consecutive reelection. Since 1997, mayors (as well as governors and
presidents) have been allowed to run for one consecutive reelection. The first municipal election allowing reelection was 2000,
and the first one with binding term limits was 2004.
    6
      The nature of the Brazilian party system has been hotly debated by comparativists. Until recently, parties were charac-
terized as weak, personalistic, and chiefly oriented towards patronage and pork-barrelling (Mainwaring 1997; Samuels 1999,
2003; Desposato 2006). This negative view has been compellingly superseded by a recent wave of research showing signs
of party strengthening in the areas of Congressional lawmaking (Figueiredo and Limongi 1995, 2000), electoral coordination
(Limongi and Cortez 2010), and in shaping voters’ stances on national issues (Samuels and Zucco 2014). Despite suggestive
evidence of party system institutionalization at the national and state levels, there is no indication that this hypothetical trend
applies to municipal politics.
    7
      Mayoral candidates form pre-electoral coalitions in 87% of the races. The mean number of parties in an electoral coalition
is 4.8. Calculations based on data from the Brazilian Federal Electoral Tribunal.
    8
      Winters and Weitz-Shapiro (2013) present survey experimental evidence showing that voters are willing to punish corrup-
tion even when mayors deliver a good performance.
    9
      This is consistent with Pereira and Melo (Forthcoming), who show that Brazilian mayors can compensate the adverse


                                                                4
     Despite disagreeing on the extent of the incumbency disadvantage, the scholarly consensus indicates
that rather than a blessing, incumbency can become a curse under some conditions. We contribute to this
literature by investigating the role of misattribution in these variable incumbency effects. If municipalities
are exposed to external shocks to incumbent performance and voters misattribute these shocks to incum-
bents’ actions, incumbents can be systematically advantaged or disadvantaged conditional on the nature
of these shocks.
     One area subject to external shocks is agriculture. Domestic agricultural prices largely reflect global
demand and supply fluctuations (Mundlak and Larson 1992), and short-term shifts on supply are as un-
predictable as they are common, leading to sharp income fluctuations in commodity-dependent locations
(Deaton 1999). Thus, we should expect international price volatility to have an impact on domestic con-
stituency incomes, possibly affecting their assessment of incumbents’ performance. Our driving hypoth-
esis is that when the value of the local agriculture production exogenously increases, voters erroneously
attribute such increase to their local incumbent. In this case, we should observe higher odds of reelection
for incumbents located where producers receive a higher price for their output. More precisely, higher
inflation in commodity prices leads to a higher incumbency advantage –measured as probability of vic-
tory. Furthermore, we anticipate that the impact of commodity inflation will increase with the degree of
ruralness of a municipality.


3    Research Design
Our research design has two components, which we address separately in this section. We start by de-
scribing our empirical strategy to isolate exogenous variation in municipal commodity inflation. We then
discuss how to embed our inflation measure on a regression discontinuity design to evaluate how inflation
shapes the returns to incumbency. The last part of this section conducts robustness checks assessing the
validity of our research design.


Determining Agricultural Commodity Shocks
Brazil is an agricultural heavyweight. According to the Brazilian Agricultural Ministry, the country is
the largest producer and exporter of coffee beans, oranges, and sugar. It ranks second in the production
and exports of soybeans, and it is the third largest exporter of maize.10 Except for the Amazon region,
production of agricultural commodities is scattered throughout the whole territory. Although some regions
are heavier producers of one or two crops, most municipalities produce a mix of several different products.
    We leverage this rich and varied commodity production to trace the effects of higher exogenous agri-
cultural prices on electoral outcomes. We construct an inflation index that varies for each individual
municipality and each electoral period, producing different shocks for all units. Our index considers all
consequences of corruption by delivering public goods.

crops whose prices are collected in international markets by the International Monetary Fund –namely
bananas, cocoa, coffee, maize, orange, rice, soybeans, sugar, and tobacco. The value of these agricultural
products account for more than 70 percent of all Brazilian agricultural output, and rural gross domestic
product (which also include livestocks) takes 23 percent of the country’s GDP. 11 Calculating price change
is straightforward. For each crop c ∈ {1, n}, our measure is constructed as follows:

               Pc,t+1 − Pc,t
       θc =                                                                                                                          (1)
                    Pc,t

    We choose the year preceding the election, and not the entire term of the incumbent for theoretical and
empirical reasons.12 First, most students of retrospective voting agree that voters rely on short-term cues
for retrospection (Achen and Bartels 2004; Bartels 2008). Using survey experiments explicitly designed to
understand the microfoundations of this pattern, Huber, Hill and Lenz (2012) and Healy and Lenz (2014)
demonstrate that individual level biases inhibit voters from weighting economic performance equally.
Second, we want to test if voters incorrectly attribute good or bad times generated by exogenous factors
to the incumbent. A longer time-horizon allows incumbents to respond to prior shocks and, correctly or
not, give incentives at the municipal level to change the agricultural production matrix, or use surplus
tax revenue to their advantage. Restricting the time frame to the year prior to the election alleviates that
concern, as mayors would not have enough time to interfere with production.
    To create an individual inflation index for all municipalities on each year, we build weights that take
into account how much each crop contributed to municipal agricultural output in the past. Thus, for
example, if total output was 800,000 and maize contributed with 200,000 and soybeans another 300,000,
they will have a weight of 1/4 and 3/8, respectively. Weights are constructed using output two years prior
to elections.13


Estimating the Impact of Price Shocks on Elections
We assess the causal impact of commodity shocks on electoral outcomes by embedding our inflation index
in a “close election” regression discontinuity design (RDD). First introduced to electoral settings by Lee
(2008), RDD provides the best empirical strategy to estimate the causal effect of incumbency on electoral
performance. RDD exploits the simple intuition that the outcome of very close elections is determined
by election-specific factors, which are not correlated with characteristics of the electoral districts in which
elections take place. Imagine that a generic party p at time t wins an election by a narrow margin in
district A and loses by a similarly narrow margin in district B. This implies that party p is being randomly
assigned to run as the t + 1 in district A and as the challenger in district B. Thus, comparing p’s electoral

      Thus, for each municipality i and electoral period t ∈ {2008, 2012} we build a vector ω such that ωit = { vV1it i

                                                                   6
performance in t + 1 in districts A and B yields an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of incumbency.
We extend this intuition to better identify the effect of commodity shocks on Brazilian mayoral elections.
Focusing on very close elections in t, we assess how the causal effect of incumbency varies as a function of
commodity inflation. We make two adjustments to adapt RDD to the Brazilian mayoral setting. First, given
the high level of personalism, our unit of analysis will be incumbent candidates rather than incumbent
parties. In turn, the focus on candidates forces us to exclude municipalities in which incumbents cannot
run in t + 1 due to term limits.
    Our RDD model of heterogeneous incumbency effects takes the following form:

       Yk,it+1 = α + β1 Incumbencykit + β2 Πkit+1 + β3 Incumbencykit ∗ Πkit+1 + δkit
                                                                                                                           (2)
                                                               ∀ kit s.t. |Mkit | < 

    where Yi,kt+1 is a measure of electoral performance for candidate k, in municipality i, at election t + 1.
Incumbencyk,it is a binary indicator of victory at election t, and captures assignment to the incumbency
treatment; δkit is an error term; |Mkit |, the forcing variable, is the difference in vote margin of the winner
and the runner-up in election t; and  is an arbitrarily small vote margin, which we operationalize by
considering three bandwidths: Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012)’s optimal bandwidth (henceforth IK),
and substantively small bandwidths of 2.5% and 1%. β identifies the average incumbency effect. The
coefficient of interest is the interaction term, β3 , which captures how the incumbency effect varies as a
function of commodity shocks. While commodity shocks are post-treatment, they cannot be plausibly
influenced by incumbency.
    Our main measure of electoral performance is an indicator of re-election. V ictorykit is a binary mea-
sure of victory for the candidate in municipality i at time t.14 We also test if inflation affects the decision
of incumbents and challengers to run the election. Runkit is a binary measure of whether the candidate
contests the election in municipality i at time t.


Robustness Checks
Our empirical strategy relies on two exogeneity assumptions. The first assumption, addressed through
RDD, is that winners and losers of close elections should not differ systematically in characteristics that
influence the returns to office. Testing this assumption is straightforward with covariates that tap ob-
servable candidate characteristics. If winning a close election is “as-if” random we should not observe
systematic differences.15 Table 1 presents results of the balance tests for each covariate, discontinuity
  14
      Though vote share is the standard dependent variable in the literature, it is unreliable in elections with more than two
contenders. New entrants may depress the share of incumbents, and exit of former challengers boost votes for the incumbent,
adding variation to the outcome that does not properly reflect electoral performance.
   15
      Failure to pass this test led Caughey and Sekhon (2011) to question the internal validity of Lee’s RD in the US. However,
as argued and demonstrated by Eggers et al. (2015) the severe imbalance may not travel to other political systems. In fact, a
similar balance test provides strong evidence of the validity of RDD in Brazil.

bandwidth, and RD specification. As a benchmark, we show the difference between winners and losers
in the full sample, before conditioning on close elections. In the full sample, winners are more likely to
belong to major parties, are less likely to be women and, conditional on having run, tend to receive lower
vote share in past elections. These differences vanish as we focus on close elections. Only one differ-
ence persists when we focus on the smallest 1% bandwidth, and only obtains when estimating differences
through local linear regression. The improvement achieved by focusing on close elections and the net
balance in the smallest window bolster the credibility of RD as a strategy to estimate incumbency effects.
    The second assumption is the exogeneity of municipal commodity inflation, which should be inde-
pendent of municipal characteristics. We evaluate it through a placebo test motivated by Equation 3. If
inflation is exogenous, future values of inflation should not influence contemporary incumbency effects.

There are two important differences between equation 3 and our workhouse equation 2, all in Π̇i,t+2 . First,
in equation 3 prices come from the year after the election in t + 1. For example, if a winning candidate
in 2004 runs for re-election in 2008, the prices in Π̇i,t+2 are taken from 2009. Note that although prices
are serially correlated, the variation in prices is not. Future price variation should not be a function of past
variation in a price-taker market. The other difference is more subtle. Although price variation is not a
function of past inflation, the weights are determined by past crop value. We cannot update the weights
since future weights are a function of past inflation. Therefore, we keep the same weights of our main
estimation in the placebo test.16

predicted contemporary incumbency effect conditional on different values of future inflation. The dashed black lines represent
95% confidence intervals. The overland histogram depicts the overall distribution of inflation. Each plot presents results for
different combinations of discontinuity bandwidth and RD specification. In the first row, the specification is difference in
means regression and in the second row the specification is local linear regression. Each column corresponds to a different
discontinuity bandwidth.

     We estimate heterogeneous incumbency effects conditional on inflation using two specifications. The
first specification, difference in means, uses a linear probability model to estimate the difference in proba-
bility of victory of incumbents and challengers in close elections and how it varies across different levels
of inflation. The second specification, local linear regression, augments the difference in means with an
interaction between the vote margin and the indicator of incumbency. The results of the estimation are
presented in Table 2. The first three columns show that across specifications and discontinuity bandwidths,
municipal inflation does not produce any difference in the probability of incumbents contesting an election
relative to challengers. This can be observed in the lack of statistical significance of the interaction term
that assesses how the returns to incumbency vary with inflation. By contrast, inflation has a statistically
significant effect on the electoral fortunes of incumbents when the metric is probability of victory in the
subsequent election. Taken together, this evidence suggests that inflation does not shape the electoral

Figure 2. Heterogeneous Incumbency Effects Conditional on Inflation.                          The solid lines depict the predicted
incumbency effect conditional on different values of inflation. The dashed black lines represent 95% confidence intervals. The
dashed vertical red line indicates median inflation, and the dashed vertical blue lines indicate standard deviations from the me-
dian. The overland histogram depicts the overall distribution of inflation. Each plot presents results for different combinations
of discontinuity bandwidth and outcome. In the first row, the outcome is candidate reelection attempts, and in the second row,
the outcome is candidate reelection. Each column corresponds to a different discontinuity bandwidth.

    By how much does inflation shape the electoral fortunes of incumbents? Though the range of coeffi-
cients from .17% to .37% appear non trivial, the best way to assess the substantive impact of inflation on
the returns to incumbency is by plotting the predicted incumbency effect for different values of inflation
as in Figure 2. The solid line depicts the predicted incumbency effect for different value of inflation and
confirms that inflation has no systematic impact on the reelection attempts of incumbents. By contrast,
inflation is highly consequential for the incumbency advantage measured in terms of probability of victory.
This effect is particularly strong in the 1% window. Considering that the median of inflation is 1.3 (cap-
tured by the vertical red line) and the standard deviation is 18 (the vertical blue lines indicate one standard
deviation above and below the median), one standard deviation in inflation leads to a 10% increase in the
incumbency advantage. This estimate from elections determined by 1% vote margin should provide the
most solid basis for estimating the causal effect of incumbency using RDD since these elections are truly
won by razor-thin margins.
    One concern with the preceding analysis is that the linearity assumption of OLS is leading us to ex-
trapolate from municipalities that exhibit extreme levels of inflation. The right-skewed distribution of
municipal inflation illustrated by the histogram underlaid in Figure 2 suggests that this is a likely possi-
bility. For example, if municipalities with over 60% inflation also have an unusually high incumbency
advantage, linear extrapolation may manufacture a positive relationship that is not supported by the data.
    As a robustness check, we complement the OLS model with interactions with a non-parametric ap-
proach. We estimate separate RDD models of incumbency effects (within 2.5% bandwidths) for different

values of inflation. The results are presented in Figure 3 which, for simplicity, depicts negative values
of inflation on the left-hand side panel, and positive values on the right-hand side panel. Though a small
number of observations limits statistical power, we can see that extremely negative values of inflation are
associated with an incumbency disadvantage. As we approach the center of the distribution, estimates
are more precise and we see neither incumbency advantage nor advantage. Turning to the right-hand side
panel, we see that positive shocks appear to consistently help incumbents get reelected.
    In sum, the analyses suggest that positive shocks in commodity prices can provide incumbent may-
ors with an advantage. While the evidence of a incumbency disadvantage is only suggestive, we can
confidently conclude that incumbency advantage does not occur in municipalities experiencing negative
commodity shocks.


Rural Versus Urban Municipalities
So far we have devoted our attention to the effect of inflation on all municipalities, regardless of their
economic dependence on agriculture. As explained in Section 3, our measure of inflation deliberately
ignores the degree of municipal ruralness. The weights we use in each individual inflation index take into
account how much one crop contributes to overall agricultural output, and not overall economic output.
This means that metropolitan areas with small agricultural productions receive the same “treatment” that
municipalities with soybean plantations. However, if retrospective voting is the mechanism through which
international commodity prices affect local elections, this effect should be heightened in rural municipali-
ties, whose income is more dependent on commodity production.
    To test this expectation, we separate municipalities in two different groups according to the contribu-
tion agriculture has on the economy. To calculate the share of agricultural output we divide the value of
agricultural production by the total municipal economic output. The Urban group comprises municipali-
ties whose agricultural output is below the study group median minus one standard deviation. Analogously,

    The results of this exercise support the hypothesis that commodity inflation is only electorally conse-
quential in rural economies. In Table 3, The coefficients for the interaction term show that inflation only
influences incumbency effects in rural municipalities. Another striking result is the disadvantage incum-
bents face in rural municipalities. Mayors and incumbent parties in urban municipalities do not face any
incumbency effect, but mayors in rural economies have to swim against the tide to be re-elected. Only
when inflation is above 20.6% (or if the municipality is treated with an inflation 1.88 standard deviations
above the average of its group) mayors lose their incumbency disadvantage.17

    Figures 4 illustrates the differential impact of inflation across municipalities. The first column is the
effect on rural municipalities, and the second column on urban municipalities. The slope of the solid line
on each panel is equal to the interaction term plus the main effect of incumbency (whose exact value we
can recover from table 3). The more positively inclined the slope is, the greater the effect of the inflation on
incumbency, and rural municipalities present a slope considerably more inclined than urban municipalities.
The point in which the solid line crosses the horizontal dashed line illustrates when the mayor should
expect not to suffer an incumbency disadvantage. Since the median inflation on rural municipalities is
8.5% the period we analyze, most mayors faced a (statistically significant) disadvantage. Mayors in urban
municipalities should neither fear to be disadvantaged, nor expect fortune’s helping hand.
    To provide a complementary non-parametric perspective on how the electoral impact of commodity
shocks depends on ruralness, Figure 5 depicts separate estimates of the causal effect of incumbency for
different groups of municipalities. We illustrate incumbency effects using two different non-parametric
strategies. The plots on the left column present scatterplots and lowess curves relating the probability of
victory in t + 1 and the vote margin of time t winners (vote margin above zero) and losers (vote margin be-
low zero). As has become standard empirical practice, an RD estimate can be visualized by comparing the
functions on each side of the discontinuity, located at zero. The second strategy, represented by the plots
on the right column, presents separate difference in mean estimates for different values of vote margin. We
apply each visualization to separate groups of municipalities stratified by the sign and magnitude of the
inflation in the study group.

commodity shock and their ruralness. The first two rows show the effect on all municipalities according to
the sign and magnitude of the price shock. The third and fourth rows do the same for rural municipalities.
We operationalize positive and negative shock in a similar manner that we divided groups among rural and
urban municipalities. If a municipality receives a shock above the median plus one standard deviation, it
has received a positive shock. Similarly, a municipality hit with an inflation below the median minus a
standard deviation receives a negative shock.

Figure 5. Incumbency effects according to the shock and type of municipality.                       The first column shows the
graphical representations of the discontinuities. The solid line shows the LOWESS estimation, and the shaded area identifies
95% confidence intervals. The column on the right shows figures with each LATE, and confidence intervals at different distances
between winning and losing candidates. Distance refers to the absolute distance between winning mayoral candidate (treated
unit) and losing candidate (control unit). LATE are estimated incrementally starting at the 1% distance up to the 15% distance
in 1% increments. Estimations includes only non term limited candidates.

    As we see in Figure 5, mayors facing a negative shock are more disadvantaged on average. However,
the estimates do not appear to be significant at the 95% level. In rural municipalities, the pattern is similar,
but the effects for mayors facing a negative shock in rural municipalities is very sizable. At the 1% margin
rural mayors experiencing severe deflation are 75% less likely to be re-elected.
    Finally, Figure 6 zooms in on rural municipalities and depicts non-parametrically how different shocks
affect incumbency effects. The plot on the left shows the effect of negative shocks, and acute deflation is
damaging to incumbent’s reelection prospects, reaching a staggering 67% disadvantage if the incumbent
in a rural municipality is facing a deflation of 20%. On the other hand, positive shocks help incumbents
too, as the right plot shows. Although receiving a negative shock of such magnitude was rare in the period
we analyze, Figure 6 shows that incumbency disadvantage persists for virtually all negative shocks.

   We test this hypothesis in a simple model: ∆GDPit = α + βΠit + δit where ∆GDPit is the year-on-year GDP change on
municipality i. Table 4 reports the result for three different discontinuity windows. As expected, inflation influences municipal
GDP.

6     Are Voters Myopic?
Another failure of retrospective voting occurs when voters evaluate performance myopically. A recurrent
finding of studies of US presidential elections is that citizens do not reward economic growth during an
incumbent’s entire term, but only during their last year. We have built this finding into our empirical
strategy by focusing on electoral year inflation. Thus, the previous analysis cannot elucidate whether
voters would react differently to the level of inflation in the previous years of the incumbent term. To
document myopia, we should show that the electoral impact of inflation disappears or attenuates when we
measure inflation over longer time spans.

Figure 7. Heterogeneous Incumbency Effects on Candidates’ Probability of Victory in Rural Munic-
ipalities with Different Inflation Time Frames. 2.5% Vote Margin Bandwidths. The solid lines depict the
predicted incumbency effect conditional on different values of inflation. The dashed black lines represent 95% confidence
intervals. The dashed vertical red line indicates median inflation, and the dashed vertical blue lines indicate standard deviations
from the median. The overland histogram depicts the overall distribution of inflation. In the first row, the the RD specification
is difference in means within 2.5%, and in the second row local linear regression within 2.5%. Each column corresponds to a
different inflation time frame.

    Do voters respond similarly to inflation farther back during an incumbent’s term? We evaluate this
question replicating the analysis of heterogeneous incumbency effect focusing on rural municipalities as
defined before and considering inflation measured across three different time-frames: 1, 2 and 3 years
before the mayoral election. Figure 7 shows the results, with each column corresponding to a different
temporal distance between the election and the measure of inflation. The results are consistent with myopic
voters. As we saw before, the electoral fortunes of mayors are highly sensitive to commodity inflation one
year before elections take place. Though still significant, the effect of inflation two years before mayoral
elections is weaker and noisier. The probability of victory of incumbents is insensitive to inflation three

7    Conclusion
In this paper, we exploited variation in commodity inflation across Brazilian municipalities to investigate
whether exogenous commodity shocks systematically shape the returns to office. Our findings suggest
that Brazilian voters cannot properly separate signal from noise, and end up placing mayors at an in-
cumbency advantage or disadvantage on the basis of outcomes beyond their control. Our analysis also
suggests that this misattribution is accompanied by myopic retrospection. These findings contribute to the
growing body of literature showing that democratic accountability may rest on weaker microfoundations
than previously assumed. If voters are unable to distinguish merit from luck, both the selection and sanc-
tioning effects of elections may be compromised (Fearon 1999). Another theoretical contribution of our
paper is to underscore that misattribution can represent a systematic source of incumbency effects. Since
developing countries are more exposed to exogenous economic shocks, misattribution may explain why
incumbency disadvantage has been more common in these settings than in advanced democracies. This
finding also suggests that tracing the electoral impact of other sources of exogenous shocks can deepen
our understanding of the nature of retrospective voting and incumbency effects in developing democra-
cies. These economies are subject to volatility from abroad, such as other countries’ interest and exchange
rates, military intervention, and more commodity prices.
