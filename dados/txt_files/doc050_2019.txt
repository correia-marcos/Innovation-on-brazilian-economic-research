      This paper analyzes the potential occurrence of financial contagion in Latin American
      markets from the recent US subprime crisis. Distinctively from the usual empirical ap-
      proaches for contagion analyses, a regime-switching skew-normal (RSSN) model is imple-
      mented in order to assess both correlation and coskewness contagion as well as investigate
      the occurrence of structural breaks in the moments of the mean, variance and skewness.
      Even though correlation contagion was observed in all selected Latin American markets,
      coskewness contagion was only detected in Brazil. Variance structural breaks were found
      in all financial markets while structural breaks in the mean were only detected in Ar-
      gentinian, Mexican and the US markets. Yet, joint contagion and structural break tests
      suggested the occurrence of these phenomena in all considered markets.

      O objetivo do presente trabalho é analisar a ocorrência de contágio financeiro nos mercados
      latino-americanos durante a recente crise do subprime. De forma distinta das abordagens
      empíricas usuais para análise de contágio, utilizamos um modelo regime-switching skew-
      normal (RSSN) que permite avaliar o contágio em correlação e em coassimetria, bem como
      a existência de quebras estruturais na média, variância e assimetria (primeiro, segundo
      e terceiro momentos). Apesar do contágio em correlação ter sido observado em todos os
      mercados estudados, o contágio em coassimetria foi observado apenas no Brasil. Quebras
      estruturais na variância foram encontradas em todos os mercados enquanto as quebras
      estruturais na média foram observadas apenas na Agertina, México e EUA. Além disso,
      os testes de quebra estrutural e contágio conjuntos apontaram para a existência desses
      fenômenos em todos os mercados analisados.

1     Introduction
After a period of low volatility, the advent of the subprime mortgage crisis in mid 2007, which
was originated due to the reversion process of the last residential construction cycle in the US,
was one of the most severe crisis in the American economy, with spillover effects on a variety of
other developed and emerging markets (Horta et al., 2008; Dooley and Hutchison, 2009; Lahet,
2009). The current process of globalization as well as technological advances have contributed to
a higher degree of financial market integration, which is largely responsible for the propagation
of international crises in the last decades (Dornbush et al., 2000). Notwithstanding the existence
of numerous benefits arising from such higher integration, some disadvantages also emerge as
the byproduct of this process. Financial contagion is one of them. Being potentially responsible
for the worsening of a market vulnerability to external shocks (Bekaert et al., 2003; Collins and
Biekpe, 2003), financial contagion might also reduce the effectiveness of portfolio diversification
(Sharma and Seth, 2012) as well as hamper policymakers’ ability of monitoring and maintaining
the financial stability of their countries.
    Despite the relevance of financial contagion for both academics and practitioners, there still
remains no consensus in the literature on the concept of contagion. According to Rotta and
Valls Pereira (2016), the World Bank provides three different definitions of contagion: broad
(can occur during both good and bad times), restrictive (excess of comovement) and very
restrictive (changes in the transmission mechanism in turbulent times, i.e., shift-contagion). In
the present paper, we follow the definition perpetrated by Forbes and Rigobon (2002), which
is equivalent to the shift-contagion principle, that is, contagion is understood as a statistically
significant change in the correlation coefficient of two (or more) financial assets in a crisis period
compared to a non-crisis period. Usually, during periods of crisis, the correlation between asset
returns tends to increase.
    In terms of methodological procedures, most applied studies on financial contagion are based
on multivariate volatility models (such as DCC-GARCH, BEKK, CCC, among others), which
lie within the class of models originally proposed by Bollerslev et al. (1988). Some recent
studies in this methodological branch are Marçal and Valls Pereira (2008) and Filleti et al.
(2008). These models are particularly useful in verifying the occurrence of contagion given that
they model the correlation structure between variables. However, overparameterization as well
as the need of imposing proper restrictions in order to proceed with estimation are underlying
limitations of such models. For instance, the Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) model
developed by Bollerslev (1990) – considered to be one of the most common models within this
class – assumes that the conditional correlations are constant over time. Although several
improvements were proposed to these models (see e.g. Galeano and Ausin (2010)), estimation
from the frequentist standpoint is still challenging.
    Against this background, the present paper applies the regime switching skew-normal (RSSN)
model developed by Chan et al. (2017) to assess the potential occurrence of financial conta-
gion between the US and four main Latin American economies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
Mexico. The proposed model is an extension of Hamilton (1989) and is particularly adequate
to evaluate contagion. First, the model assumes data is non-normally distributed, which is
an important feature of financial series – usually, financial series are characterized by heavy
tails, that is, their distribution is leptokurtic, reflecting the higher likelihood of extreme events
compared to the normal distribution. Moreover, by considering regime switching features, the
model is also able to capture comovement shifts between asset returns due to regime transi-
tions, which is the exact definition of contagion considered in this paper. Given the rather
large amount of parameters and latent variables, the Bayesian approach is considered to be


                                                 2
more appropriate for this type of models. More specifically, we applied Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) techniques in order to retrieve the posterior estimates of the switching param-
eters and then perform the contagion tests. Also, distinctively from the multivariate volatility
models, the regime transition in the RSSN model is endogenous. As discussed by Chan et al.
(2017), by defining strict periods of crisis and non-crisis without a endogenous mechanism of
transition, one might obtain misleading results. Hwang et al. (2011) assert that another limi-
tation in empirical studies on contagion is their assessment of only correlation shifts (see also
Pukthuanthong and Roll (2009)). Given that the correlation coefficient is a linear measure
of dependency between distributions, such coefficient might not reflect the proper dependency
relationship since the definition of contagion is based on a non-normal non-linear structure of
dependency. In this sense, the proposed model also allows for the evaluation of higher-order
moment contagion (e.g. coskewness) given that it can capture changes in the joint distribution
of the asset returns. The financial literature has in fact discussed the importance of equity re-
turn skewness and coskewness for portfolio management. For instance, during crises, negative
return skewness tends to become positive since risk averse investors recompose their portfolios
to include assets with this characteristic (Fry et al., 2010). Assets with positive skewness (i.e.
tail is on the right side) have fewer negative returns with higher probability. The coskewness
coefficient is defined as the covariance between an asset return and the squared portfolio re-
turn, thus being related to the systematic contribution of this asset to the portfolio skewness.
Consequently, if an asset return and a portfolio present positive coskewness, they will usually
present extreme positive returns in excess of market returns at the same time, which ultimately
leads to lower expected returns. Conversely, negative coskewness implies higher probability of
underperformance relative to market returns at the same time.
     The present study contributes to the existing literature by assessing the existence of financial
contagion in the Latin American economies in the aftermath of the recent global financial crisis
not only through correlation (linear or non-linear) but also through coskewness in the context
of endogenous regime transitions. To the best of our knowledge, no study has attempted
to use such approach to investigate both correlation and coskewness contagion effects in Latin
America during the recent US financial crisis. Given the highly volatile nature of these markets,
analyzing the potential occurrence of financial contagion is essential, especially in the presence
of non-linear behavior. Calvo and Reinhart (1996), Chen et al. (2002) and Coronado et al.
(2016) describe the specific characteristics of financial markets in Latin America.
     The obtained results confirm the hypothesis of correlation contagion in the selected Latin
American markets, with probability of 100%. Hence, we found evidences of a statistically
significant increase in the correlation between the US and each Latin American market during
the 2007 global financial crisis. The assessment of coskewness showed that such coefficient
increased for all five considered countries, even becoming positive for Brazil and Mexico, that
is, these financial markets shifted toward a more risk-averse profile than in the pre-crisis period,
with investors seeking safety strategies (lower volatility and lower expected return). Regarding
the interrelationship with the US, only Argentina depicted a less risk averse behavior, indicating
greater risk appetite. As for the existence of coskewness contagion, such phenomenon was only
observed in Brazil, suggesting that risk-averse investors tended to migrate their investments
from the Brazilian market to the US during the crisis. Consequently, these findings indicate
that, among the selected Latin American countries, the Brazilian market apparently endured
the most significant negative effects of the recent crisis. The occurrence of structural breaks in
the moments of the mean, variance and skewness was also analyzed. Structural breaks in the
mean were only present in Argentina and the US whereas the probability of variance structural
break was 100% for the five financial markets. As for skewness structural breaks, decisive

support of such phenomenon was only found in Mexico. Overall, these findings reaffirm the
relevance of financial contagion in Latin America.
    Besides this introduction and the concluding remarks, the paper is organized in three sec-
tions. First, Section 2 describes the RSSN model as well as the contagion and structural break
tests. Section 3 presents the data and the posterior estimates of the switching parameters.
Finally, Section 4 addresses the results for the contagion tests and the occurrence of moment
structural breaks.


2     A regime switching skew-normal model for asset re-
      turns
According to Hamilton (1989), nonlinear stationary processes are intrinsic features of macroeco-
nomic time series. By amending the parameters of an autoregression to allow for a discrete-state
Markov process, the regime switching model departed from the restrictions imposed by linear-
ity. Yet, others still remained. As discussed in Chan et al. (2017), financial time series are
usually characterized by asymmetry, heavy tails and heteroskedasticity. In order to circumvent
such restraints, the latter authors extended the regime switching model of Hamilton (1989) to
a multivariate skew-normal framework, following the skew-normal distribution developed by
Sahu et al. (2003). This so-called regime switching skew-normal (RSSN) model is argued to
better represent the intricacies of high frequency data.

by Zt .

two-state Markov chain, so that the standard Markov transition is given by

    Note that the RSSN model allows the means (µst ), coskewness (Ωst ), and the error cross-
covariances (Σst ) to change in accordance to shifts in regime. Hence, given the existence
of two regimes, there are two sets of regime-dependent parameters, namely (µ0 , Ω0 , Σ0 ) and
(µ1 , Ω1 , Σ1 ). Chan et al. (2017) argue that changes in the parameters of correlation and coskew-
ness during the second regime are to be understood as contagion whereas changes in the moment
parameters of the mean, variance and skewness in the second regime are to be understood as
structural breaks.

   Testing for financial contagion and structural breaks requires restrictions on the RSSN model
parameters as well as the evaluation of underlying hypotheses. Assume the RSSN model as the
unrestricted model (Mu ). This model embodies two sets of regime-specific parameters, which
are comprised of regime-specific mean vectors µ0 and µ1 , covariance matrices Σ0 and Σ1 , and
coskewness matrices Ω0 and Ω1 . The correlation coefficient ρij,l is obtained by the ratio of the
covariance Σij,l and the product of the square root of the variances Σii,l and Σjj,l , that is,
                                                                  Σij,l
                                                ρij,l = q           q       .                                               (13)

Note that the subscript (ij, l) refers to the ij-th element of the respective matrix in the regime
l.
    For the specific case of financial contagion, five alternative tests are performed. First,
contagion between financial markets is detected if the correlation coefficient increased in the
regime st = 1 in comparison to the regime st = 0. In mathematical terms, we test whether

                                                ρij,st =1 − ρij,st =0 > 0                                                   (14)

for i 6= j. Chan et al. (2017) argue that such hypothesis is based on the idea perpetrated by
Forbes and Rigobon (2002) that markets are expected to behave more similarly during a crisis.
The probability associated to the correlation contagion between markets i and j is defined as

                                         Pr (ρij,st =1 − ρij,st =0 > 0 | y, Mu )                                            (15)

and is calculated from the MCMC draws.
   Second, joint correlation contagion between the m − 1 pairs of asset returns with market j
can also be tested for. In this case, we obtain the sum of the individual correlation coefficients
Υl = m
       P     Pm
         i=1  j6=i ρij,l for each regime and then test for joint correlation contagion, that is,




                                                              6
whether Υ0 ≤ Υ1 . Similarly to the previous case, such joint probability of correlation contagion
is estimated based on the MCMC draws.
    A third alternative test is the coskewness contagion test which relies on the idea that
contagion occurs when the asymmetric dependence of returns i and j changes across regimes.
According to Chan et al. (2017), this test is compatible with the bivariate coskewness statistics
for contagion developed by Fry et al. (2010). The coskewness contagion test is given by

                                                 ωij,st =0 6= ωij,st =1                                    (16)

for i 6= j. Hence, the restricted model (Mr ) for the coskewness test is set as ωij,st =0 = ωij,st =1 ,
for i 6= j. As the test involves equality restrictions, we depart from the probability decision
to Bayesian model comparison methods. Following Chan et al. (2017), the natural logarithm
of the Bayes factor is used as the decision statistics and the model selection threshold follows
the scale proposed by Jeffreys (1961).1 Evidence in favor of Mu supports the hypothesis of
bivariate coskewness contagion.
    It is also possible to test for joint coskewness contagion in which we investigate whether
there were shifts in coskewness across all m asset markets. In this case, the joint coskewness
contagion test is defined as
                                        m
                                      m X
                                      X                           m
                                                                m X
                                                                X
                                                 ωij,st =0 6=              ωij,st =1 .                     (17)
                                      i=1 j6=i                  i=1 j6=i


Thus, the restriction imposed to the model is comprised of m    m                m    m
                                                                              P      P       P    P
                                                           i=1  j6=i ωij,st =0 = i=1  j6=i ωij,st =1 .
As the previous case, the natural logarithm of BFru is computed. Evidences in favor of Mu
indicates the existence of joint coskewness contagion.
   In addition, both correlation and coskewness contagion can be jointly tested for. The proce-
dure consists of imposing both restrictions to the RSSN model and then computing the natural
logarithm of BFru . However, despite knowing the prior distributions of the associated pa-
rameters, the density in the simultaneous presence of such restrictions is usually not known.
Therefore, Chan et al. (2017) propose a Gaussian kernel estimation to approximate such un-
known densities, following Geweke (2010).2 Once again, evidences in favor of Mu indicates the
simultaneous occurrence of both types of contagion.
   Yet, the RSSN model also allows for the testing of structural breaks in the mean, variance
and skewness for asset market i during st = 1 compared to st = 0. For the first case, testing
the existence of a structural break in the mean for asset market i relies on the idea that the
mean decreases in financial crisis periods given that expected returns are lower. Hence, the
probability for market i is defined as
   1
    Despite being an alternative to classical hypothesis testing, the choice of Bayesian model comparison is
driven by the fact that it is also a suitable approach for comparing non-nested models. The Bayes factor is
defined as

                               p(y|Mr )                                                
                      BFru =              ⇐⇒         ln BFru = ln p(y|Mr ) − ln p(y|Mu )
                               p(y|Mu )

with p(y|Mr ) and p(y|Mu ) being the marginal likelihoods of the data under models Mr and Mu , respectively.
For technical details on computing the marginal likelihoods, refer to Chan et al. (2017). Note that the marginal
likelihood of Mr will be small if the data are improbable under such model. Hence, the BFru indicates which
model better fits the given data.

set markets is achieved by considering the whole mean vectors µst =1 and µst =0 , so that the

and can also be estimated from the MCMC draws.
    The structural break test for the variance of the returns of market i is obtained by testing
the hypothesis that Σii,st =1 − Σii,st =0 > 0 since the variance of returns is expected to increase
in the financial crisis regime. Therefore, the underlying probability has the form

                                  Pr (Σii,st =1 − Σii,st =0 > 0 | y, Mu )                        (20)

which is also calculated from the MCMC draws. The joint test version for all m asset markets
is computed by evaluating the proportion of times Σst =1 − Σst =0 > 0 in the MCMC draws,
where Σst =1 = m
               P                             Pm
                  i=1 Σii,st =1 and Σst =0 =  i=1 Σii,st =0 . Consequently, the associated probability
is given by

                                    Pr(Σst =1 − Σst =0 > 0 | y, Mu )                             (21)

and is obtained from the MCMC draws.
    The last set of structural break tests consists of evaluating potential changes in the skewness
of asset returns in regime st = 1 compared to regime st = 0. The individual test for asset
market i is based on the hypothesis that ωii,st =0 6= ωii,st =1 . Yet, Chan et al. (2017) argue that
there still remains no macroeconomic consensus on the direction of skewness changes during a
crisis. Therefore, they propose an agnostic stance regarding such movements, recognizing both
positive and negative changes as possible outcomes. Formally, the latter hypothesis is tested
by imposing ωii,st =1 = ωii,st =0 to the RSSN model and comparing the unrestricted model to the
restricted one through the Bayes factor. Note that in Mu all regime-specific parameters are
free to vary across regimes whereas Mr considers no skewness changes for the asset market i.
Similarly to the previous cases, evidences in favor of Mu suggest the occurrence of a structural
break in the return skewness for market i. On the other hand, the joint evaluation of a potential
structural break in the return skewness of all m asset markets is performed by imposing the
assumption that ωii,st =1 = ωii,st =0 , for all i = 1, . . . , m, to the RSSN model. The Bayes factor
is then computed and evaluated.
    Finally, the RSSN model also allows for the testing of the simultaneous occurrence of conta-
gion and structural breaks by simultaneously imposing the necessary restrictions to the RSSN
model and evaluating the Bayes factor. For instance, one can evaluate the coexistence of a joint
structural break (i.e. simultaneous mean, variance and skewness structural break) for the asset
market i with a joint bivariate contagion (i.e. correlation and coskewness contagion) between
asset markets i and j. Note that the occurrence of joint contagion and structural breaks across
all asset markets is also possible under the RSSN framework. Yet, as previously discussed,
there still remains concerns about the associated densities in the presence of such restrictions.
These unknown densities are also estimated by a Gaussian kernel estimator.

3            Data and econometric estimates
We investigate the potential occurrence of contagion effects between the equity returns of the
US and four Latin American markets (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico – the LA-4) dur-
ing the recent subprime crisis. To this end, daily equity market indices for the latter markets
were collected from the Bloomberg financial database. More specifically, we use the following
stock market indices: (i) Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Ibovespa index for Brazil (IBOV:IND),
(ii) Santiago Stock Exchange IGPA index for Chile (IGPA:IND), (iii) Buenos Aires Stock Ex-
change Merval index for Argentina (MERVAL:IND), (iv) S&P/BMV IPC index for Mexico
(MEXBOL:IND), and (v) Dow Jones Industrial Average index for the US (INDU:IND). The
daily percentage returns are computed as the hdifference of naturali   logarithms of the daily equity
indices, multiplied by 100, that is, rt = 100 × ln(yt ) − ln(yt−1 ) , where rt is the daily percentage
return of an equity index at time t, and yt and yt−1 are the daily equity indices at time t and
t − 1, respectively. In addition, given that different stock markets are subjected to different
holiday schedules, missing equity indices are carried forward from the last observed index as to
make the calendar compatible across the five selected countries. Finally, following Chan et al.
(2017), the residuals of a VAR(5) are used as the data during the estimation procedure.
    Data span the period from January 4, 2005 to November 28, 2014. Following Chan et al.
(2017), the period from January 4, 2005 to July 25, 2007 is defined as the Great Moderation
whereas the Global Financial Crisis corresponds to the period from March 3, 2008 to November
28, 2014. Consequently, from July 26, 2007 to February 29, 2008, both the selected Latin
American and the US markets are in transition from the former period to the latter one. In
fact, preliminary visual inspection of the financial time series in Figure 1 suggests that the
fluctuation of equity returns increased from 2008 onwards, especially in Argentina, Chile and
the US. Such fluctuation increase also indicates the potential presence of a non-constant and
time-dependent volatility.

   Yet, priors for the hyperparameters in Equations (8) to (10) need to be specified in order to
proceed with the Bayesian estimation. Following Chan et al. (2017), we set β = 0, φµ = 0.01,
φω = 1, τ Σ = 20 + m + 1, S Σ = (τ Σ − m − 1) × Im , with m = 5. Note that the priors for

                                                                                                                     9
the variances (i.e. φµ and φω ) are relatively small as to guarantee the prior distributions are
proper and slightly informative. Regarding the priors for the transition probabilities, it is first
assumed that Pr(st = 1 | st−1 = 0) = Pr(st = 1 | st−1 = 1) = pt . Then, following Chan et al.
(2017), the initial value for the probability of being in the Great Moderation regime is defined
as Pr(st = 0) = 0.99 for the period between January 4, 2005 and July 25, 2007. In contrast, the
probability of being in the Global Financial Crisis regime is defined as Pr(st = 1) = 0.99 for the
period between March 3, 2008 and November 28, 2014. One should note that the probability
of being in the Great Moderation regime decreases linearly from 0.99 on July 26, 2007 to 0.01
on March 3, 2008.
    As in Chan et al. (2017), we also restrict the coskewness matrix Ω of Equation (1) to be a
symmetric matrix so that the dimension q    of ω becomes k = m(m + 1)/2. Further, the constant
term c in Equation (3) is defined as c = − 2/π, which leads to E(Zt ) = 0 and V (Zt ) = (π−2)/π
and ensures that the inclusion of latent variables (i.e. Zt ) has no effect on the (unconditional)
expectation of yt .
    We performed 200,000 iterations of the MCMC algorithm with the first 10,000 draws being
discarded in the burn-in period. Given that MCMC sampling methods are commonly associated
to autocorrelation and, consequently, biased Monte Carlo standard errors, we only retain every
10th iteration in order to circumvent such issues. Hence, posterior means are computed based
on 20,000 MCMC draws. Table 1 presents the posterior means of the switching parameters for
the selected Latin American markets and the US during both the Great Moderation and the
Global Financial Crisis regimes.
    In terms of correlation and coskewness, the obtained results show considerable variation
between regimes (Table 1). Correlation was found to be higher during the Global Financial
Crisis regime in comparison to the period of Great Moderation. This result is in line with
the evidences presented by the international literature on financial market linkages during
crises (see e.g. Roll (1988), Hamao et al. (1990), King and Wadhwani (1990), Malliaris and
Urrutia (1992), Erb et al. (1994), Lin et al. (1994), Solnik et al. (1996), Ramchmand (1998),
Cizeau et al. (2001), Longin and Solnik (2001), Ang and Chen (2002), Butler and Joaquin
(2002), Bartram and Wang (2005), Meric et al. (2008), among others). Accordingly, such cross-
market correlation rise in the context of high volatility ultimately reduced the benefits of risk
diversification in the Latin American markets in the aftermath of the United States subprime
mortgage crisis.
    When compared to the Great Moderation period, coskewness between all pairs of Latin
American markets became less negative during the Global Financial Crisis, with coskewness
between Mexico and Brazil even becoming positive (Table 1). Given that positive coskewness
reduces the risk of the portfolio in high volatile periods (Harvey and Siddique, 2000; Adesi
et al., 2004; Guidolin and Timmermann, 2008), these findings suggest that the Latin American
financial markets shifted toward a more risk-averse profile than in the pre-crisis period. Yet,
regarding the interrelationship with the US, coskewness became positive for almost all selected
Latin American markets. Similar results were also found in recent studies for the European
markets and the US (Fry et al., 2010; Fry-McKibbin et al., 2014; Chan et al., 2017). Note that
the Argentina-US pair is the only exception, with the value of coskewness falling from −0.327
to −0.858. Thus, while most of Latin American markets presented a more risk-averse profile
relative to the US during the subprime crisis, investors in Argentina seem to have become even
less risk averse.
    The obtained results for the moments of the mean, variance and skewness are also regime-
dependent (Table 1). During the Great Moderation, mean returns for the five considered mar-
kets were positive, with Mexico and Brazil exhibiting the highest values: 0.086% and 0.080%,

respectively. However, as expected, mean returns decreased in the aftermath of the subprime
crisis, with the Brazilian mean return even becoming negative (−0.017%). The variance of daily
equity returns considerably increased in the Global Financial Crisis regime relative to the Great
Moderation regime. For instance, while the Argentinian and Brazilian variances substantially
increased after the subprime crisis (from 1.001 to 3.599 and from 1.131 to 3.054, respectively),
Chile presented the lowest increase among the considered markets (from 0.272 to 0.690). As
for skewness, negative parameters were found for all five selected markets during the pre-crisis
period. Still, the obtained results for the Global Financial Crisis regime shows that the skew-
ness parameters shifted toward less negative magnitudes in Brazil, Chile and Argentina. In the
case of Mexico and the US, even though the same direction of change was observed, skewness
parameters turned positive. Based on the Arrow-Pratt notion of risk aversion (Pratt, 1964;
Arrow, 1971), right-skewed (positive skewness) payoffs are preferable to left-skewed (negative
skewness) ones in the context of risk-averse investors. Therefore, the positive skewness param-
eters for Mexico and the US imply that investors considered these markets to be relatively safer
than Brazil, Chile and Argentina. Similar results for the European markets and the US were
found by Fry et al. (2010) and Fry-McKibbin et al. (2014).
    But how did the probability of the model being in a certain regime change over time? Figure
2 displays the posterior probability of being in the Global Financial Crisis regime during the
sample period. The regime transition was apparently initiated in mid 2007, period in which the
US economy severely suffered from increases in risk spreads, wealth contractions, and shortage
of liquidity in the credit market (Goodhart, 2008; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008). Such transitions
across regimes were unstable until February of 2008, settling into the crisis regime thereafter.
Note that the transition to the Global Financial Crisis regime for the selected Latin American
markets took place before the collapse of the Bear Stearns Hedge Group in March of 2008, an
event considered as a main trigger of the subsequent financial crisis. Using the same econometric
framework, Chan et al. (2017) found similar results for the European markets and the US.

4    Addressing contagion and structural breaks
Even though the regime-dependent nature of both our low- and high-order moment estimates is
readily observable, properly identifying potential contagious linkages arising from the US equity
market on Latin America during the Global Financial Crisis is still imperative. The first panel
of Table 2 presents individual and joint contagion tests for the correlation and coskewness
channels. First, note that correlation contagion is characterized as a statistical significant
increase in the correlation parameter during the Global Financial Crisis relative to the previous


                                                                   12
regime. That being said, the obtained results provide strong evidence of correlation contagion
between the US and Latin American returns, with p = 1.00. Even when jointly considering the
US and all Latin American markets, the contagion tests still indicate the occurrence of such
contagion mechanism (p = 1.00).
    However, coskewness contagion was only observed for the Brazil-US pair, with a value of the
log of the Bayes factor ln(BFru ) of −8.54. Consequently, this result suggests that risk-averse
investors tended to migrate their investments from the Brazilian market to the US during the
crisis. As discussed in Chan et al. (2017), the presence of coskewness contagion in only some of
the considered markets indicates the relative severity of the crisis in the financial sector of these
economies relative to the other markets. Thus, the US subprime crisis spillovers seem to have
affected the Brazil more severely than the rest of the Latin American markets. Interestingly,
when considering the coskewness test for all markets (∀i), there is decisive evidence of contagion,
with the value of the log of the Bayes factor ln(BFru ) being −172.22.
    The jointly occurrence of both the correlation and coskewness contagion is tested in the
bottom row of the first panel of Table 2. For each US-Latin American market pair, the joint
contagion tests provided decisive support for both phenomena during the Global Financial
Crisis regime. The same conclusion is obtained when jointly considering all Latin American
markets and the US.

 comprising 2584 daily observations. Note that p and BF refer to decision methods based on probability and the Bayes Factor,
 respectively. The bold results indicate the presence of contagion or structural break.


    As a second step, we also investigate the likelihood of moment structural breaks in the
mean, variance and skewness for each equity return. The second panel of Table 2 presents such
results. Even though the structural break tests suggest only Argentina and the US individually
presented such phenomenon, the test considering all five markets combined indicate a structural
break in the moment of the mean during the Global Financial Crisis period (p = 0.98). Note
that this latter result might reflect the strong evidences of such structural breaks in Argentina
(p = 0.99) and the US (p = 0.99).
    In regards to the second moment, the probability of a structural break for all equity markets
is 100% (Table 2). As expected, when considering all five markets jointly, the structural break
test for the variance confirms the individual results, with probability of 100%. These results
are in line with the stylized fact of higher equity return volatility during crisis periods.
    The results for the presence of a structural break in skewness are decisive only for Mexico,
with the value of the log of the Bayes factor ln(BFru ) being −2.56 (Table 2). Yet, similar to

the test of a structural break in the moment of the mean, the results for skewness considering
all five markets also suggest a statically significant shift in the parameter in the aftermath of
the US subprime crisis, with ln(BFru ) = −5.28.
    For each market, joint tests were also performed in order to assess whether the mean, vari-
ance and skewness, jointly, presented structural breaks. The obtained results are summarized
in the last row of the second panel of Table 2. Note that the values of the natural log of the
Bayes factor for all five markets, both individually and jointly, provide decisive evidence of
structural breaks. Still, it is important to highlight the fact that, in general, the structural
break in the variance emerges as the most important one for all five equity markets.
    Finally, we also considered the concomitant occurrence of both contagion and structural
breaks for each market as well as all the five markets jointly. The last panel of Table 2 reports
the joint test estimates. Given that the US is considered the source of the crisis, there is no test
statistics for this market. Overall, our findings provide decisive evidence of joint contagion and
structural breaks for each individual Latin American market and for the five combined markets.
However, these results must be interpreted with caution. As the joint tests for contagion and
structural breaks consider a variety of comoment and moment changes between regimes, the
sole use of their results might induce misleading conclusions. For instance, even though the joint
contagion and structural break test indicates the occurrence of both phenomena in Chile, the
results of individual tests suggest neither coskewness contagion nor mean or skewness structural
break. Still, these joint tests are appealing tools in order to further validate the individual
results.


5     Concluding remarks
This article investigated the potential occurrence of financial contagion between the US and se-
lected Latin American equity markets during the recent US-based global financial crisis. More
specifically, through the application of the regime switching skew-normal (RSSN) model devel-
oped by Chan et al. (2017), we evaluated the likelihood of contagion by considering potential
changes in the comoments of correlation and coskewness in the Global Financial Crisis regime
compared to the Great Moderation regime. As a second step, we also tested for the presence of
structural breaks in the moments of the mean, variance and skewness. Assessing the possibility
of these phenomena is relevant in order to better comprehend the intricacies in the behavior of
risk averse investors in Latin America during the recent crisis.
    First, the posterior estimates of the switching parameters revealed their regime-dependent
nature. Indeed, correlation between Latin American markets and the US increased during the
Global Financial Crisis regime in comparison to the Great Moderation regime, which ultimately
reduced the benefits of risk diversification in these emerging markets. Moreover, with excep-
tion of Argentina, the observed rise in coskewness during the crisis period suggests that the
Latin American markets shifted toward a more risk-averse profile relative to the US than in the
pre-crisis period. While the variance of equity returns of all five considered markets increased
considerably during the crisis regime, the mean equity returns presented a rather substantial
decreased, with the Brazilian mean even becoming negative. As for skewness, daily equity
returns exhibited less negative coefficients during the financial crisis relative to the pre-crisis
period. In fact, positive skewness parameters were even found for Mexico and the US. Con-
sequently, these results for skewness imply that risk averse investors considered Mexico and
the US to be relatively safer markets than Brazil, Chile and Argentina in the aftermath of the
recent financial crisis.
    Both the individual and joint contagion tests provided significant evidence of correlation

contagion from the US for all the selected Latin American markets, with probability of 100%.
Yet, coskewness contagion was only decisively observed for the Brazil-US pair. Furthermore,
structural breaks in the mean were only present in Argentina and the US whereas the probability
of variance structural break was 100% for the five financial markets. As for skewness structural
breaks, decisive support of such phenomenon was only found for Mexico. Yet, joint contagion
and structural tests provided decisive evidence of their occurrence for each individual Latin
American market and for the five combined markets.
    The results found in the present paper contribute to the recent debate on the occurrence of
contagion and on potential restructuring policies for the international financial system. Deter-
mining the existence of financial contagion is of major concern for investors given its effect on
portfolio risk management and portfolio expected return. On the other hand, the evaluation
of financial contagion is also important to policymakers as to design proper macroprudential
strategies in order to minimize potential financial spillovers on economies during crisis as well
as discuss the resilience and efficiency of the financial system in the context of high-volatility
returns.
