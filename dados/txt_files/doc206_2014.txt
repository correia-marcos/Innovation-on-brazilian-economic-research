Resumo: Medir quão distantes países ou regiões se encontram do objetivo normativo da
igualdade de oportunidades em educação tem sido foco de contribuições recentes na
literatura econômica, as quais têm se concentrado, ou em hiatos, entre grupos da
população, no acesso a determinados níveis de ensino, ou então em hiatos, entre grupos
da população, em resultados em testes de conhecimentos. Argumenta-se neste trabalho
que ambos os aspectos – oportunidade ao acesso e ao conhecimento – são importantes, e
sobretudo inter-relacionados, de modo que, por consequência, ganham em ser
mensurados simultaneamente e combinados num índice composto de igualdade de
oportunidades em educação. Aplicando-se o índice a dados recentes provenientes dos
exames internacionais do PISA para um conjunto selecionado de países, observam-se
mudanças de ordenamento na comparação com rankings estabelecidos com base numa
única dimensão. O índice composto pode ser generalizado para incorporar outras
dimensões, como nível médio de conhecimento e dissimilaridade no acesso.

Abstract: Measuring how far away countries stand from a goal of equality of
opportunity in education has been the focus of recent contributions in the economic
literature, which have concentrated either on inter-group gaps in access to a given level
of studies, or on inter-group gaps in educational achievement. We argue that both
aspects are important and interrelated and, as a consequence, should be measured
simultaneously and combined in a composite index of equality of opportunity in
education. Employing recent PISA data for a selected set of countries, rank reversals are
observed with respect to orderings based upon a single dimension. The index can be
generalized to include further dimensions, such as average scores or dissimilarity in
access.

1. Introduction
Measuring how far away countries stand from a goal of equality of opportunity in
education has been the focus of recent contributions in the economic literature, which
have concentrated either on inter-group gaps in access to a given level of studies, or on
inter-group gaps in educational achievement. We argue that both aspects are important
and interrelated and, as a consequence, should be measured simultaneously and
combined in a composite index of equality of opportunity in education.
Pertaining to a liberal-egalitarian tradition of theories of justice, John Roemer’s (1998)
concept of equality of opportunity (EOp) states that if a given outcome inequality
between a pair of individuals is observed (ex post) and if it can be traced back to
different predetermined circumstances (ex ante), it will be declared that opportunities
have not been equal. Equality of opportunities is thus inferred from observing outcome
inequalities conditional on circumstances.
If, on the one hand, the fraction of an observed inequality which is due to different
circumstances is deemed intolerable, on the other hand, the fraction which is due to
deliberate, conscious, choices made by the individuals is acceptable. Different
methodologies have been proposed by economists attempting to translate those ideas
into measuring procedures, which grosso modo try to decompose overall inequality into
two components: the fair and the unfair fractions (e.g., Checchi & Peragine, 2010;
Dunnzlauf et al. 2010). The larger the calculated share of unfair inequality, the further
away from equality of opportunity a given country or region is. Two recent surveys are
available documenting the vast literature produced since 1998 (Pignataro, 2012; Ramos
& Van de gaer, 2012).
When it comes to assessing equality of opportunities in education in particular, at least
two major dimensions are important. On the one hand, there is access. Being enrolled in
a school is a necessary condition for obtaining formal instruction and all the advantages
that it provides. If we admit that no kid or teenager should be held responsible for
having dropped out, an educational system which fails to retain in schools a
considerable portion of a country’s pupils’ cannot be viewed as one fulfilling EOp in
education. If, to the contrary, every kid is enrolled, there is equality of opportunities in
the primary, narrow, sense that a minimal threshold of opportunities has been provided
to all – a dimension which we denote “access-EOp”.
On the other hand, in a broader, more comprehensive, perspective, access might be
viewed as a necessary, but not sufficient condition for EOp in education. All individuals
of a given cohort might be enrolled in schools, but the learning conditions faced by
different pupils might be so dissimilar – according to, say, their social background or
their gender –, that some will not learn adequately, while others will acquire an
outstanding level of knowledge. To the extent that such achievement gaps are due to
inequalities in predetermined circumstances, there is inequality of opportunities within
Roemer’s framework. If achievement gaps are not related to predetermined

circumstances, but only to conscious choices – say, more or less time spent doing
assigned homework – made by individuals facing equal (or similar) circumstances then
equality of opportunity in achievement (or “achievement-EOp” for a shorthand) could
be declared.1 In a way, it can be said that access-EOp precedes achievement-EOp as a
requirement for overall EOp, or that the former is necessary and the latter is sufficient.
An ideal education system would make sure all kids are enrolled, and would ensure
achievement is uncorrelated to pupils’ socioeconomic background.
As mentioned above, measuring how far away a given country stands from equality of
opportunity in education has been at the center of recent contributions, which
concentrate though on only one of those two important and interrelated dimensions –
that is, either on access-EOp (e.g., Paes de Barros et al. 2009; Vega et al. 2010 ), or on
achievement-EOp (e.g., Checchi & Peragine, 2005; Ferreira & Gignoux, 2011; Gamboa
& Waltenberg, 2012). In the latter contributions, pupils’ achievement is measured by
standardized test scores, such as those made available by OECD’s Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA).
Such contributions are important for having improved our knowledge on equality of
opportunity in education – that is, on the extent of inter-group gaps in access, as well as
of achievement gaps. It must also be acknowledged that the first set of contributions,
focusing on the more basic requirement for EOp, which is access-EOp, is somehow
“allowed to ignore” the achievement dimension. Nonetheless, an important limitation
affects the second set of contributions, dedicated to measuring achievement-EOp only:
the more primary requirement of EOp, which is acess-EOp, is ignored when it should
not be. Countries, or regions within a country, have been compared regarding
achievement-EOp, employing samples which are not uniform in terms of coverage of a
given cohort.2 For example, if country A shows more calculated achievement-EOp than
country B but country A’s sample covers a smaller fraction of its cohort of pupils than
does country B’s sample, it will be unclear whether country A should indeed be
declared as one providing more education opportunities than country B. The
information on coverage (a potential proxy for access, as discussed later) should not be
simply disregarded as it has been.
Previous attempts of addressing such problem of disregarding access have been
ingeniously performed by Ferreira & Gignoux (2011), who have tried to explicitly
reconstruct a full sample before calculating achievement-EOp. Our strategy is of a
different nature. Instead of attempting to simulate a full sample, we explicitly
acknowledge there are two different and complementary dimensions of educational
opportunity - (i) access and (ii) achievement conditional on access - and then we
aggregate them into a composite index.
Aggregating the dimensions is not trivial, among other reasons because the relative
weight attributed to each dimension will certainly vary according to normative
preferences or to the objective of each study. Besides choosing weights, another
decision concerns the specific functional form of the composite index. We have opted
for aggregating the dimensions in a simple, multiplicative way. The procedure provides
an index which, while adjustable to different normative preferences, precludes the
possibility of perfect substitution of one dimension by the other, which is justified since
both are intrinsically important in our view.

We illustrate our approach for six Latin-American countries and five developed
countries with high performance in standardized tests that took part in PISA 2006 and
2009. Depending on the relative weight attributed to each dimension, the index we
introduce ranks the countries differently than does a conventional index, exclusively
focused on achievement-EOp, and thus is capable of representing a wider spectrum of
preferences regarding the relative importance of achievement-EOp with respect to
access-EOp.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to explaining the motivation for
this study. In Section 3 we describe our approach. Section 4 reports an application for a
selected set of countries. In Section 5 we generalize our method, allowing for further
dimensions and weights. Section 6 contains final remarks.


2. Achievement-EOp calculations and attempts to circumvent the coverage rate
   problem
We mentioned before that achievement-EOp calculations have employed standardized
test scores from OECD’s PISA. Collected every three years since 2000, PISA datasets
include test scores of representative samples of students in dozens of countries in three
subjects – mathematics, sciences and reading – as well as detailed information on
students' background and schools' personnel and functioning conditions. The fourth
wave (2009), employed in this paper, contains samples of about 520 thousand students
representing pupils of more than 70 countries (OECD, 2012: 25).
PISA samples have a limitation which is rarely emphasized – possibly because it is
irrelevant for other purposes but which matters for ours – namely, that the samples do
not necessarily represent the national population of 15-year-olds in every participating
country. The reasons fall into two categories: (i) some eligible pupils do not take the
exams for logistic or fortuitous reasons (e.g., pupils living in a remote region, or pupils
who were sick the day the exam took place); local managers of PISA exams might also
exclude some pupils for physical or intellectual deficiencies (the accepted cases of
which are carefully detailed in PISA manuals), and (ii) individuals who are enrolled in a
very low grade (“grade 6” or below3) or who are not enrolled in schools are not assessed
by PISA, being considered “ineligible”. While the exclusions for fortuitous or technical
reasons affect all countries to a certain extent, they are meaningless from the point of
view of educational-EOp, since they do not denote any obvious deficiency of the
education system. The second category is more problematic. As a consequence,
empirical findings based on PISA should not be taken as valid for cohorts of 15-year-
old individuals, but for individuals who: (a) have not abandoned the educational system,
and (b) have not repeated too many grades. While the actual and the ideal samples do
not differ very much in developed countries, they diverge considerably in developing
countries.

 PISA’s “grade 6” corresponds with different names in different countries. PISA technical reports (e.g.,
OECD, 2009 and 2012) provide tables containing country-by-country corresponding labels.

                       Figure 1: Coverage rates at PISA 2006-2009




The proportion of the cohort of 15-year-old individuals which has been excluded is not
uniform, neither across countries, nor over time. As shown in Figure 1, differences can
be substantial casting doubts on the reliability of cross-country comparisons. The
coverage rates4 in 2006 and 2009 in a selected set of Latin American countries are a
good example: Argentina (79%, 69%), Brazil (55%, 63%), Chile (78%, 85%),
Colombia (60%, 59%), Mexico (54%, 61%) and Uruguay (69%, 63%). These figures
reveal that: (i) coverage rates are not high on average, (ii) although all countries come
from the same region, cross-country dispersion is substantial, with a range of around 25
percentage points in each year, (iii) there are within-country oscillations across waves
(6.5 percentage points on average).
For example, if Mexico turns out to show a better achievement-EOp figure than
Argentina in 2006, it will be unclear whether that indeed reflects less EOp in the latter
than in the former, or whether such result is driven by a more homogeneous sample in
Mexico (lowest coverage rate in that year) than in Argentina (highest rate). In other
words, had all 15-year-old Mexicans taken the exam, would Mexico’s good EOp record
as compared to Argentina’s remain?
To address coverage rate problems – in PISA and possibly in other test scores datasets –
, we view at least three paths. The first is simply to be cautious when interpreting results
of studies employing PISA for developing countries. That is simple, but risky, since
readers (and policymakers) might basically overlook the call for caution. Gamboa &
Waltenberg (2012) opt for that path, presenting results based on PISA limited samples
and emphasizing that caution is necessary in their interpretation.

  Along this paper, we shall call “coverage rate” the ratio in a given country and year between the
weighted estimate of eligible non-excluded 15-year-olds from the student sample and the national 15-
year-old population.


                                                                                                  5
A second path consists of explicitly reconstructing full samples. Recently Ferreira &
Gignoux (2011) have done so for four countries: Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey.
Due to the absence of information in PISA samples about non-participant pupils, it is
not possible to perform a correction such as Heckman's procedure (except through
appropriate instrumental variables and complementary datasets). They have turned to
ancillary datasets (i.e. household surveys), which, however, do not contain information
on test scores, and they have then imposed some assumptions in order to undertake two
kinds of simulation. The first consists of re-weighting test scores observations in PISA
using information taken from the ancillary databases on the fraction of different types of
individuals in the population.5 The second one consists of imputing into the dataset
pupils who were not evaluated, ascribing to them scores equal to the lowest score
obtained by individuals very similar to them according to observable characteristics.
The first simulation, which relies on more conventional assumptions, provides results
almost equal to the original results, both in terms of overall inequality and of unfair
inequality. While such somewhat unexpected finding might offer relief for those
employing PISA datasets, applying the procedure to other countries/years could lead to
more substantial changes. The second simulation leads to sizeable differences with
respect to the naive calculations, but as Ferreira & Gignoux (2011) themselves
acknowledge, their assumptions are “admittedly extreme”.
We would like to view our approach as complementary to those two we have just
described. Yet, we believe the former one is subject to misinterpretation of results. And
as for the latter, sample corrections still present high costs (especially being data-
intensive) and limited benefits (results based on strong assumptions). For these reasons
we tend to favor a different path.


3. A composite index that combines access and achievement
We explicitly assume there are two dimensions of educational opportunity – namely, (i)
access, and (ii) achievement conditional on access – each of which might rely on a
different branch of the EOp literature and thus be measured according to a specific
procedure before being aggregated into a composite index.
Since we have used as the motivation for this paper shortcomings in the calculations of
achievement-EOp based on PISA, we shall emphasize the way we can circumvent them
also based on PISA. But the procedure we discuss might be adapted and employed with
other datasets and in different contexts. Let us now describe how each dimension could
be calculated before turning to aggregation issues.
1. Inequality of opportunity in achievement. We restrict the calculation of inequality of
   opportunity in achievement to the available PISA samples employing Ferreira &
   Gignoux’s (2011) regression-based index of inequality of educational opportunity
   (hereafter: IOFG). This is calculated as the proportion of the variance of test scores
   that is explained by a set of circumstances, ranging from IOFG = 0 (perfect equality
   of opportunity) to IOFG = 1 (perfect inequality of opportunity). The exercise
   undertaken is essentially a static decomposition of inequality (as expressed by the

    They adapt the methodology proposed by DiNardo et al. (1996).


                                                                                        6
    variance) into unfair inequality (the R-squared) and fair – more precisely, “residual”
    – inequality (1 – R-squared).6
2. Inequality of opportunity in access. To the best of our knowledge, no consensus has
   emerged concerning how to adequately measure inequality of opportunity in terms
   of access. We propose employing countries’ coverage rates available in PISA
   technical reports, which might range from 0 (no coverage) to 1 (full coverage).
   Following Paes de Barros et al. (2009) and Vega et al. (2010) the overall coverage
   rate is denoted p , with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. The rationale is to sanction each country
   according to the extent to which its educational system excludes individuals from
   PISA exams.7
Employing the coverage rate or the enrolment rate as a measure of access might be
defended by those who view access exclusively as a function of circumstances, such
that any deviation from full coverage should be sanctioned, irrespectively of which
groups are excluded, in which case the greater the distance from full coverage ( p = 1)
the larger the inequality of opportunity in that country.
One might object that what would matter for Roemer’s concept of EOp would not be
the overall coverage rate, but rather the extent to which different groups are excluded
from PISA. That would require penalizing a country whose coverage rate varies across
groups. In such scenario, an index as the so-called ‘Human Opportunity Index’ (Paes de
Barros et al., 2009) could be a candidate, since one of its component terms is a
dissimilarity index, expressing cross-types inequalities in access. However, a powerful
objection to employing HOI is that it implicitly assumes that observed access
inequalities are partly fair, which is inconsistent with EOp theory in that being out of
schools (or PISA) is not a choice for which teenagers should be held responsible.8
Information on PISA’s coverage rate has another advantage over the alternative
mentioned above, namely, the fact that is can be easily gathered, since they are readily
available in PISA reports. Not requiring the handling of further datasets might be an
attractive feature for both researchers and policy makers willing to make international or
intertemporal comparisons relatively swiftly. Finally, since the coverage rate is
provided in PISA technical reports, the data employed in both dimensions (achievement
and access) would come from the same source, which means more clarity and
uniformity in definitions, as compared to the alternative which would involve different
sources of data for each country.
The remaining step is to aggregate such dimensions into one composite index. Being
aware that different views on the relative importance of each dimension will never be

6
  Since the R-squared never goes down when new variables are added to the regression, it can be
interpreted in the present context as a lower bound for achievement-InEOp. For details see Ferreira &
Gignoux (2011).
7
  A similar strategy would consist of employing enrollment rates of 15-year-olds, which also range from 0
to 1, sanctioning each country according to the extent to which its educational system excludes
individuals from schools (generally). To that rate could be added information, if available, on the
proportion of 15-year-olds who have repeated too many grades, assuming that multiple grade repetition is
not only a barrier to being eligible to PISA exams, but also a predictor of restricted life opportunities. For
the sake of simplicity, we employ PISA coverage rates.
8
  Sill, in section 5, the more general version of the composite index, will include a measure of inter-group
inequality of access, satisfying those who believe that would be an important ingredient in measuring
EOp in education.


                                                                                                            7
consensually settled, we have opted for aggregating the dimensions by means of a
Cobb-Douglas specification allowing different choices of relative weights to each
dimension.9
Although there is no consensus about the best aggregation procedure Cobb-Douglas’s
has been frequently employed above all due to its simplicity. With such functional form,
the attributes cannot be perfect substitutes as they would be with an additive form,
which makes sense since both dimensions are important and interrelated in our view.
Moreover, it respects two properties, which are well-known in microeconomics: (i)
mononicity: an increment in the value of either attribute always increases the index’s
value; and (ii) convexity: a moderate improvement in both dimensions results in a more
substantial increment of the index value than a (relatively) large improvement in only
one dimension. Mononicity is important because we would like to reward
improvements observed in each dimension; convexity is useful because we would like
to reward more those countries which care about both dimensions, and do not, so to
speak, “specialize” in one of them. The Cobb-Douglas specification is also very
flexible, allowing the inclusion of new variables and the use of weights for each
dimension reflecting the relative importance attributed to each component.
The “Bidimensional Composite Index of Educational EOp” (or BIE) we propose takes
then the following simple form:

                                                                       b

                                                         
                                         access EOp    achievement  EOp


                            with: 0 ≤ p ≤ 1, 0 ≤ IOFG ≤ 1, 0 ≤ BIE ≤ 1, 0 ≤ a ≤ 1, 0 ≤ b ≤1.



The parameters a and b reflect the relative importance of each component, and, for
simplicity, it is common to assume a+b=1.10 The index is increasing in p and
decreasing in IOFG as would be desirable. Since IOFG ranges in the interval [0,1], with 0
standing for perfect equality of opportunity in achievement, (1 – IOFG) will equal 1 in
the case where circumstances are completely unrelated to outcomes for pupils who have
taken PISA exams. In such limiting case, BIE will depend solely upon the coverage
rate: the higher it is, the larger the educational opportunities offered to 15-year-olds of a
given country will be.
Conversely, in a case of full coverage, where p = 1, the index BIE will depend solely
upon inequality of opportunity in achievement – a situation that might make sense for
analyses of educational EOp in developed countries, where p does actually tend to 1.

Developing countries more often face the challenge of having to improve
simultaneously in both dimensions, facing limited budgets that need to be allocated
based on priorities (e.g., long vs short run). In some cases coverage might be easier to
tackle than actual learning – but such policy choice will impact less in the index than
9
  In the course of this research, we also employed fuzzy sets transformations. As results were qualitatively
equal to those reported here, we opted for omitting those based on fuzzy sets.

   Cobb Douglas functions are homogeneous which implies that if we multiply each component by a
constant, the outcome will be that constant raised to the sum of exponents.

policy choices which conduct to improvements in both dimensions (for reasons already

4. Application
We compare rankings of educational-EOp for selected countries that took part in PISA
2006 and 2009 using BIE1 and a ranking obtained from a conventional index that only
takes into account achievement-EOp.
In calculating the achievement dimension, we follow Ferreira & Gignoux (2011),
employing PISA’s “plausible values” for Mathematics as a measure of test scores and a
set of circumstances including: mother and father education, father occupation, stock of
educational capital, city size and ownership of specific durables. In this first application,
the weights have been set to a = b. Results are reported in Table 1.

Both in 2006 and in 2009 rank reversals are observed when switching from an EOp
index that focuses exclusively on achievement (1 – IOFG) to an index that encompasses
both achievement-EOp and in access-EOp (BIE) and weighs them equally.11 Argentina
is the most opportunity-unequal country in 2006 in terms of achievement (lowest value
in columns (1–IOFG)), but after taking into account its relatively good coverage rate, it
moves up two positions (third-lowest value in column BIE). Chile also moves up two
positions. Colombia and Mexico do the opposite movement (5th to 8th, and 9th to 11th,
respectively). In 2009, Brazil and Chile, for example, exchange their positions as we
move from column (1–IOFG) to column BIE.
Our results can be plotted over a map of so-called “iso-opportunity curves”, as do
Barros et al. (2009), simultaneously showing where a country stands in either dimension
(in each axis), and in terms of overall educational EOp (the level curves). Figure 2a
contains iso-opportunity curves for PISA 2006. Points representing Brazil and Mexico,
which lie below the curve “BIE=0,4”, are to be contrasted with Chile’s, which is above
the curve “BIE=0,5”, or Portugal, above “BIE=0,5”. Other developed countries cluster
way higher. It is interesting to compare Argentina and Colombia: while the former
performs relatively well in the access-EOp dimension and poorly in the achievement-
EOp dimension, the latter presents the opposite situation. With equal weights, Colombia
reaches a higher iso-opportunity curve.

In Figure 2b, we employ different weights for each dimension, privileging the access-
EOp dimension (a = ¾; b = 1/4). Uruguay and Argentina, which were in different iso-
opportunity curves in Figure 2a, now share the same iso-opportunity curve, since
Argentina performs well in access in comparison to other countries. With the new
weights, Argentina’s iso-opportunity curve is higher than Colombia’s (while they were
tied before). Developed countries in Figure 2b cluster again above the curve “BIE=0.8”,
with the exception of Portugal, which is close to Chile.
In Figure 3, we present a wider range of views on the relative importance of access-EOp
and achievement-EOp, by ranking now only our six Latin American countries according
to multiple weights.As expected, as we diminish the relative weight attributed to
achievement, we approach rankings based on access alone. Figure 3 also allows a direct
visual inspection of strengths and weaknesses of different countries in each dimension
of educational EOp. For example, in both years Argentina and Chile increase their level
of educational EOp as more emphasis is put on access-EOp (going from left to right in
the graph). Brazil, Mexico and Colombia follow an opposite pattern. Uruguay’s
calculated level of educational EOp is roughly flat across different values for the
parameter a.

To some extent Figure 3 summarizes all that has been discussed so far, in three senses.
Firstly, it confirms the need to take access into account when dealing with PISA-based
analyses encompassing developing countries. Secondly, it shows that different
observers might rank differently a given set of countries and thus reach different
conclusions regarding educational EOp according to the relative weight attributed to
each dimension. Thirdly, it attests that conventional rankings of educational EOp –
either based on access alone or on achievement alone – can be viewed as particular
cases of BIE.

5. Generalization
To employ the composite indices defined in previous sections means working with
social welfare functions – or, more precisely, “equality-of-opportunity functions” –
based upon certain attributes, BIE = f (access-EOp, achievement-EOp). However, other
attributes could be incorporated, as well as sub-attributes. Over this aggregation
process, each dimension might vary its relative importance providing different
interpretations and rankings. More generally, the index could be composite, but with
multiple components.
Average scores, for example, might be a relevant dimension of opportunities. Education
is certainly a “positional good”, in the sense that various advantages that derive from
having more of it depend on the relative level a person has as compared to those living
in the same city, or province, or country. For most jobs, for example, an employer will
choose the best candidate - e.g., the one with the best education record – among a pool
of local competitors. In that sense, what matters is only the educational achievement of
a person as compared to those around her. But it might also be true that for some jobs –
in an increasingly globalized economy – competition is at an international level. If this
is so, it will be useless to have the highest achievement in your locality if that is low at a
more global level. Even if we ignore international jobs (which arguably are not the most
frequent), it still is possible to argue that higher average scores are better than lower
average scores. It might be better to live in a city, or province, or country, where the
overall level of achievement is higher than elsewhere. There might be positive
spillovers from education, such that, for example, more jobs are created in more
dynamic places.

In Table 2, we show both for 2006 and 2009 the calculated value of multiplying BIE
reported in Table 1 by (s ) , defined as ratio of the average score in each country to the
maximum possible score in PISA (700). Mexico and Brazil exchange positions in this
new ranking as compared to Table 1’s ranking due to Brazil’s extremely low average
scores. The same happens in 2009 between Colombia and Uruguay. With this new

Not only might the achievement dimension of the index be enriched – for example, by
taking into account average scores as mentioned above. The access dimension can also
be sophisticated, for example, in order to account for cross-groups inequalities in
access, as measured, for instance, by the dissimilarity index – already alluded to in this
paper.12 We could then indeed have four components in a meaningful multidimensional
composite index of equality of educational opportunity (MIE), which would now
include two new terms: cross-types dissimilarity with respect to access (1 - D), and a
country’s average score (s ) , suitably transformed to fit the [0,1] interval.

where: 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ IOFG ≤ 1 are defined as in Equation 3.1; α, β, γ and δ are (normative)
weights, all of them nonnegative and normalized to sum 1; 0 ≤ D ≤ 1 stands for a dissimilarity
index, which aggregates the distance between the average coverage rate and each type’s
coverage rate weighted by the relative frequency of each type in the population; s represents
average scores transformed to fit the [0,1] interval.

  Although in that point we rejected the use of the human opportunity index or the dissimilarity index, in
the basis of conceptual and practical disadvantages, and defended the use of PISA’s coverage rate, it
might be the case that other researchers or policymakers have a different view or find it worth it to invest
time in gathering and ancillary, national, datasets. This is why we include the dissimilarity index in this
version of the index.

In Equation 3.2, the term (s ) is within the achievement-EOp dimension the analogue of
 ( p ) within the access-EOp dimension, in the sense that both reflect overall educational
opportunities available in the country (average scores and overall access, respectively).
Similarly the remaining terms, (1 – D) and (1 – IOFG), are analogous since both indicate
the way the available opportunities (for access and for achievement, respectively) are
distributed across groups.
As argued before, different persons might value differently each dimension of equality
of educational opportunity. If someone thinks average scores might have nothing to do
with equality of opportunity, it simply requires setting γ = 0. The opposite extreme view
is one which would ignore the distributional issues captured by p , D and IOFG and care
only about average scores, which would only require setting γ = 1 and α = β = δ = 0. All
those cases can be viewed as particular cases of the more general MIE.


6. Final remarks
Measuring educational-EOp has been the focus of recent contributions in the economic
literature, which concentrate either on opportunity for access to a given level of studies,
or on opportunity in terms of educational achievement. In this paper, we combine both
concerns. The method introduced here points out the inappropriateness of EOp indices
that overlook participation especially in developing countries where many young
individuals still abandon the educational system in early years of their lives, temporarily
or for good – in either case, becoming ineligible to PISA and probably facing the
prospects of limited life opportunities.
The computation of any multidimensional index requires solving the difficult issues of
assigning weights to each dimension in the aggregation step and the choice of an
appropriate aggregation method. Our application to selected countries shows how
rankings approach unidimensional-EOp orderings as relative weights tend to limiting
values (as would be expected). For a sufficiently large weight attributed to the access
dimension, countries are ranked very differently than they are by EOp indices regarding
achievement only, confirming the need to take access into account when dealing with
PISA-based analyses encompassing developing countries.
It is important to notice that, while motivated by PISA’s problem, the index offered here
is applicable with due adaptations to analyses that employ other datasets presenting
similar problems. In a way, any computation of achievement-EOp which ignores the
access dimension will miscalculate the actual education opportunities provided in a
country.
In addition to incorporating further dimensions, as proposed in section 5 through MIE,
there are other paths for deepening or extending what has been done here. Regarding the
achievement-EOp dimension, the sensitivity of results to different sets of circumstances
included in the regression-based estimations could be tested. As for the access-EOp
dimension, the results presented here could be compared to those relying on other
definitions of access-EOp (enrolment rate, for example). It would also be interesting to
study the effect of employing alternative aggregating procedures. Finally it might be
useful to decompose the contribution to educational-EOp of different dimensions and
sub dimensions, and to observe how they evolve over time, possibly connecting the
observed evolution to policies or exogenous shocks affecting pupils and their families.
