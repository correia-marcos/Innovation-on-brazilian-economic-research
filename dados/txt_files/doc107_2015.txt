One issue that affects the economic and social development of a country is the ability of the judiciary to present
itself as a legitimate instance in resolving conflicts that arise in the social, business and economic
development. One way to measure this is through legitimacy of the motivations that lead citizens to trust or
not in the Judiciary. We created the Brazilian Confidence in Justice Index (BCJI) as a validation argument
for our confidence measure. The BCJI is a measure of perception, which shows the opinion of the population
about Brazil’s judiciary. Our results indicate that race and gender are important predictors once controlled
for other characteristics of respondents. Blacks have a slightly lower level of confidence in the judiciary than
whites. Women also present less confidence than men. We also show that people with low income have lower
levels of trust. Our findings also have other important implications for confidence in the judicial system. We
show that there is a positive and strong relationship between confidence in the judicial system and propensity
to seek the judiciary.

Uma questão que afeta o desenvolvimento econômico e social de um país é a capacidade do Judiciário de se
apresentar como uma instância legítima na resolução de conflitos que surgem no desenvolvimento econômico
e social. Uma forma de medir isso é através da legitimidade das motivações que levam os cidadãos a confiar
ou não no Judiciário. Nós criamos um índice de confiança na Justiça no Brasil (BCJI) como argumento de
validação para nossa medida de confiança. O BCJI é uma medida de percepção que mostra a opinião da
população sobre o Judiciário. Nossos resultados indicam que raça e gênero são importantes preditores uma
vez controlados por outras características dos respondentes. Os negros têm um nível ligeiramente inferior de
confiança no Judiciário do que os brancos. As mulheres também apresentam menos confiança do que os
homens. Mostramos também que as pessoas com baixa renda têm níveis mais baixos de confiança. Nossos
resultados também têm outras implicações importantes para a confiança na justiça. Mostramos que existe
uma relação positiva e forte entre a confiança na justiça e propensão a buscar o Judiciário.

    1. Introduction

A crucial factor in the economic and social development of a country is the ability of the judiciary to
present itself as a legitimate instance for the resolution of social and economic disputes. One way to
measure this is through legitimacy of the motivations that lead citizens to trust or to distrust the
judiciary.
Institutions matter when transactions are costly (Coase, 1960); they provide structures through which
individuals can make transactions despite uncertainty (North, 1990: 3). For North, individuals act
with bounded rationality rather than the instrumental rationality. Economic agents make their choices
based on incomplete information or with limited computational capacities to process information.
This occurs because individuals cannot perfectly predict the circumstances under which the
transactions will take place. That is, human interaction is uncertain and costly, which hampers
cooperation and economic exchanges. Thus, institutions exist to reduce uncertainty as well as
transaction costs “by establishing a stable structure to human interactions” (North, 1990: 6). Some
institutions, however, are more efficient than others in reducing transaction costs. Institutions are not
necessarily or even usually created to be socially efficient; rather they, or at least the formal rules, are
created to serve the interests of those with the bargaining power to devise new rules (North, 1990:
16). Among what North calls “formal institutions”, the legal institutions provide a set of rules and
procedures that protect property rights and ensure economic exchanges.
The institutional infrastructure therefore fundamentally affects the political system of a country in
which the rule of law exists. The judiciary is among the most important institutions in achieving and
maintaining this condition (Buscaglia and Domingo, 1997). The judiciary has been a vital part of the
emergence and consolidation of democracy in most Latin American countries as they moved from
military and authoritarian regimes to democracy over the last two decades, mediating and resolving
the disputes that arise in society, business, economy, and politics. Trust in the judiciary creates
legitimacy and consolidates the rule of law (Levasseur, 2002). Measuring judicial performance is in
this sense a way of measuring the effectiveness of the rule of law in a country. It is an indicator of
the quality of a country’s democracy (O`Donnell, 1998).
Notwithstanding an extensive literature examining trust in the judiciary in developed countries, scant
attention has been devoted to emerging countries. The purpose of this study is to understand some of
the determinants of public trust in the judicial system in Brazil, using a survey carried out in seven
Brazilian states. It explores correlations between trust in the judicial system and a pool of
demographic and economic variables such as race, income, age, gender, schooling years, previous
experience with the judicial system, and knowledge about the judiciary.
We developed a measure of judicial performance in Brazil based on the motivations that drive people
to trust or to distrust the country’s judicial system. The result is an index of trust in the Brazilian
justice, presented as a statistical summary carried out in seven Brazilian states and based on a
representative sample of the population of these states. We used eleven waves of a survey via
telephone interviews conducted by the São Paulo Law School of the Fundação Getulio Vargas. The
sample consists of 4,685 respondents in 2010, 6,213 respondents in 2011, and 6,049 respondents in
2012.
One problem in describing public trust in the judiciary is that it is multifaceted. According to Staats,
Hiskey and Bowler (2005), judicial performance is a multidimensional concept. The authors built a
measure based on five dimensions: the extent of independence, accountability, efficiency,
effectiveness, and accessibility. They surveyed 17 Latin American countries, interviewed legal
experts, and developed a composite measure based on these five dimensions.

We approach the same problem in a different way: we assess judicial performance via the factors that
lead people to trust or to distrust the judicial system. We are interested in effectiveness in terms of
expediency in deciding disputes; competence to resolve disputes (responsiveness); impartiality as a
measure of accountability; independence from external political influence; and ease of use and costs
as measures of access to justice. We created the Brazilian Confidence in Justice Index (BCJI) as our
trust measure. The BCJI is a measure of perception; it reflects the opinion of the respondents about
Brazil’s judiciary.

In Brazil, the judiciary has a dual role. Sadek (2004) sees the Brazilian judiciary as both a state power
and a public service provider. It acts as a state power when judging whether or not policies and actions
of the executive and legislative branches of government comply with the Constitution, and it acts as
a public service provider when adjudicating disputes and guaranteeing individual rights. We focus on
the public service provider role of the judiciary: that is, on how effective it is in guaranteeing "justice"
for individuals and business.

The results indicate that people with greater knowledge of the judicial system present higher levels
of trust in the Brazilian judicial system. This conclusion, however, may in some contexts be related
with the knowledge of the laws themselves rather than of the actual procedures of the judiciary.
Another finding is that individuals with more schooling years (e.g., college-level education) also have
a slightly higher level of trust in the judicial system. Compared to less-educated individuals, they tend
to think that justice is cheaper, easier to access, more independent, honest, and competent. Our results
also stress that race and gender are important predictors, once controlled for other characteristics of
the respondents. Black persons have a slightly lower level of trust in the judicial system than do non-
black persons, which can be explained in part by their perception that the judicial system is more
expensive for and less fair to them. Compared to men, women think on one hand that the judiciary is
faster, but on the other that it is less honest, accessible, inept at dispute resolution, and only somewhat
independent. We find that people who have had previous experience with the judicial system report
lower levels of trust. They believe that justice is more expensive and slower than do inexperienced
individuals.

Finally, we analyzed the relationship between trust in the judicial system and propensity to seek the
judiciary in some hypothetical situations; this may be seen as a measure of realization of such trust
in terms of actually demanding the services of the judiciary. We show that there is a positive and
strong relationship between trust in the judicial system and propensity to rely on the courts. This
result indicates that although the judiciary has lower levels of trust according depending on some
demographic and economic characteristics, people nevertheless generally see it as a legitimate way
to seek solution to their problems and do not hesitate to go to court in order to resolve the disputes
which arise in their daily lives.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the empirical literature related to trust in the
judicial system; Section 3 describes our methodology and our sample; Section 4 presents the results;
and finally Section 5 presents the conclusions.

    2. Literature Review

The literature indicates that a variety of factors -- including gender, race, income, years of formal
schooling, and previous experience with the judiciary -- influence public trust in the courts. Lawrence
(2002) presents evidence that in the United States women rely less on justice compared to men. In
general, these results seem to be related with perceived violence and discrimination against women.
Nomura (2010) and Brown, Moon and Zoloth (1980), for instance, show that gender-based wage
discrimination is very significant in the United States labor market.
Lovell (2000) argues that women and black persons who work in São Paulo experience greater
discrimination when compared to their counterparts in Bahia. In addition, Waiselfisz (2012) shows
that among 84 countries Brazil has the seventh highest female murder rate. Given all this, we expect
that there are significant differences in terms of trust in the judicial system between men and women
in Brazil.
Another question that emerges is whether skin color matters in terms of trust in the judical system.
Sherman (2002) presents evidence that in the United States there are clear racial divisions of opinion
about the criminal justice system’s component institutions, though not about the system as a whole.
He shows that non-black persons have twice as much trust in their local court systems than do black
persons. DeLisi and Regoli (1999) show that black persons in the United States are arrested,
prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated in numbers disproportionate to their percentage of the
population. For them, one explanation of this is that racial discrimination against black persons
pervades the American of criminal justice system. In Brazil, black persons are more severely punished
than non-black persons counterparts for committing crimes of equal or comparable severity (Adorno,
1995). Bailey, Loveman and Muniz (2013) find that racial disparities in Brazil are most severe at the
upper end of the income distribution and that racial disparities in earnings are larger when race is
determined by interviewers rather than self-identified.

Bennack (1999) shows that in the United States people with higher incomes and more years of formal
schooling report greater trust in most of the institutions examined. Trust in the criminal justice system
is generally more prevalent among younger people, those who are better educated, and those with
higher incomes (Jones, Weatherburn, and McFarlane, 2008). Furthermore, people who know more
about the courts are more likely to feel confident in them, as are people who have higher education
levels (Benesh, 2006). In the Brazilian context, we also expect that people with higher incomes and
more years of formal schooling will exhibit higher levels of trust in the Brazilian judicial system.
Salzman and Ramsey (2013) find that in Latin America previous experience with the judicial system
is likely to cause more awareness of the court’s deficiencies and hence probably leads to lower levels
of trust in the judicial system. They also show that even in situations where a litigant achieves success
in the courts, the experience with the imperfect process in a Latin American judicial system may still
result in lower levels of trust relative to the inexperienced position from which the litigant began.
Thus, people who have had previous experience with the judiciary may present lower levels of the
trust in the judicial system when compared to people who have had no previous experience with the
Brazilian judiciary.
Knowledge about the judicial system has a significant relationship with trust in the courts (Gibson et
al.,1998; Benesh, 2006). In emerging economies, individuals who are better informed about the
judicial system will recognize its inadequacies, which leads to lower levels of trust (Salzman and
Ramsey, 2013). In this context, we expect that there is a difference between people with and people
without knowledge of judiciary procedures in terms of trust in the Brazilian judicial system.

   3. Methodology and Sample

Our results are based on eleven waves of a survey conducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012. This survey
was performed via telephone interviews over a period of thirty-three months. The population of the
survey is comprised of people distributed across the following states: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Rio
Grande do Sul, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and the Distrito Federal, which combined represent
approximately 60% of the population, according to the 2010 census conducted by the Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). The respondent is an individual who represents the
selected household, of any gender (male or female) and aged 18 or higher.

We use a method of proportional quota sampling, using the following quotas: gender, household
income, education, age, and economic status (i.e., economically active or not). The groups (strata)
were proportionally distributed according to the 2010 Census and the 2009 National Household
Sample Survey4. Our sample consists of 4,685 respondents in 2010, 6,213 respondents in 2011, and
6,049 respondents in 2012. Table.1 provides an overview of the sample.
                                               Table.1 Sample Description
    The sample is distributed through 7 states, which according to 2010 census data together correspond to approximately
    60% of the country’s population. The sample size was determined by the number of inhabitants in each state. The
    sampling frame was constructed so as to have a range of 95% and an absolute sampling error of 2.5%.

Table.3 displays descriptive statistics for covariates. We have that 38% of respondents claim to trust
the Federal Government and 39% of respondents have had previous experience with the judiciary.
Our sample is similar to Brazilian demographic data in terms of gender and race. In our sample, 52%
of respondents are female and 10% are black. The overall Brazilian population is 8% black and 51%
female according to the 2010 Census. Our sample diverges somewhat from the 2010 Census in terms

of income. The number of households with monthly per capita income between 0 and 1 minimum
wages represents 46% of our sample. For the Brazilian population as a whole the corresponding share
is 54%. In our sample households with monthly per capita income between 1 and 4 minimum wages
represent 37% of population. In Brazil the corresponding share is 31%. These differences can be
partly explained by the fact that our sample includes some of the richest Brazilian states: São Paulo,
Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul. Appendix A.2.4 displays these statistics by
state.
Our sample is representative, however, for the following seven states: Minas Gerais, Pernambuco,
Rio Grande do Sul, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and the Distrito Federal. Our sample data is
generally similar to demographic data for these states in terms of gender and race. In terms of income,
the starkest divergences occur in the cases of Bahia and Pernambuco. Households with monthly per
capita income between 0 and 1 minimum wages represent 74% and 73% of the population in Bahia
and Pernambuco, respectively. In our sample, these numbers are 53% and 52%, respectively.

The BCJI is calculated as the average from a set of nine questions covering the main aspects of
confidence in the judicial system. The respondent must issue his opinion on the judicial system
regarding: confidence; speed in solving conflict; cost access; ease of access; political
independence; honesty; ability to solve conflicts; panorama of the last 5 years and expectation for
the next 5 years. Appendix A.2.1 presents details regarding questionnaire used by the FGV Survey.

For each question, we use the weighted average of responses. For example, in order to compute
the weighted average of the first question about trust in the judicial system, we use four response
categories that include: 1 = not at all confident, 2 = not very confident, 3 = fairly confident, and 4
= very confident. In order for each question to have the same weight in the index, we normalize
each question so that’s its value ranges from 0 to 10. The normalization is given by the ratio
between the value of the response to each question and its maximum possible value. This ratio is
then multiplied by 10. Thus, to compute the BCJI, we first sum the responses to all 9 questions,
and then divide by 9. As each question ranges from 0 to 10, it follows that the BCJI will also range
between 0 and 10. Appendix A.2.2 presents details regarding index construction. Table.4 describes
the BCJI and its components.

                           Table.4 Description of the BCJI and its Components.
The questions that constitute the questionnaire admit either four or five responses. Each question is identified by assigning
an index n to its response, which also corresponds to a value assigned to that response. Thus, the first response, i.e., the
answer 0, is assigned the value 0. To the last response is assigned the maximum value, which can be either 3 or 4
depending on whether the question has four or five possible responses. The values are first normalized so as to range
between 0 and 10, and then weighted according to the proportion of each question. To compute the BCJI, we first sum
the weighted responses for all 9 questions, and then divide by 9.

Table.5 displays the basic statistics of the BCJI for each year. Overall, the BCJI has been fairly
stable between 2010 and 2012. This is natural insofar as institutional change is generally
incremental rather than sudden, an accumulation of many small changes rather than occasional
large changes. Institutional change over time is path-dependent because individuals learn,
organizations develop, and ideologies form in the context of a particular set of formal and informal
rules (North, 1990).

Although the BCJI has not dramatically changed over time, there are have occured some significant
fluctuations in some demographic and economic characteristics of respondents such as race,
income, age, gender, schooling years, previous experience with the justice, and knowledge about
the judiciary.

Table.6 provides Pearson correlation coefficients between the BCJI and its component questions.
In all sample years, the BCJI correlates positively with each question, with coefficients ranging
from 0.41 to 0.64. Part of this correlation is by construction, because each question is a part of the
BCJI. The correlations between questions are generally positive and statistically significant but
moderate. The correlation is high for some questions like trust, access cost, and honesty, but only
moderate -- between -0.02 and 0.35 -- for the other questions. This suggests that, except for trust,
access cost, and honesty, colinearity between the questions and the BCJI should not be a big
problem.

To shed some light on the drivers for individual trust in the judicial system we adjusted a model
including demographic and economic variables by running Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (Pooled
OLS) regressions. The BCJI for respondent 𝑖 in period 𝑡 (𝐵𝐶𝐽𝐼𝑖,𝑡 ) is modeled as:

   𝐵𝐶𝐽𝐼𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝛽3 𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽4 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑡

Many personal characteristics are potentially associated with trust in the judiciary. We therefore
included also an additional set of control variables, such as state, quarter, employment, and marital
                              ′
status dummies (included in 𝑥𝑖,𝑡 , which is a column vector of control variables).

In order to examine the relationship between these features and the questions of BCJI, we ran Pooled
OLS for each question.

   4. Empirical Results

4.1.Trust in the Judicial System

Regression analysis was used to examine the influence of gender, race, income, schooling years,
previous experience with the judiciary, and knowledge about the judiciary on public trust in the
judicial system.
Table.7 shows that trust in the judicial system varies widely among these groups. Women trust the
judiciary less than men do. The results obtained via Pooled OLS indicate that the levels of trust in the
judiciary of women are 12 basis points lower (with significance at the 1% level) than those of men.
Compared to men, they see the judiciary as less honest, faster, only somewhat independent, more
difficult to access, and less effective little in resolving disputes.
These results are similar to Lawrence (2002) and may be explained in part by two aspects:
discrimination and violence against women. Brazil has the seventh highest female murder rate among
the 84 countries examined by Waiselfisz (2012). He shows that the murder rate in Brazil was roughly
4.4 victims for every 100,000 women. Physical violence is prevalent, comprising 44.2% of cases.
The share of psychological or moral harassment is higher than 20%, and 12.2% of victims are sexually
assaulted. Some studies also show that significant discrimination exists within the Brazilian labor
market. Lovell (2000) argues that women and black persons who work in São Paulo experience
greater discrimination than their counterparts in Bahia.
Race is also an important predictor of citizens’ trust in the judicial system. We find that black persons
have lower levels of trust in the judicial system than do non-black persons. The results indicate that
the levels of trust of black persons in the judiciary are 4.8 basis points lower than those of non-black
persons (with significance at the 10% level). Compared to non-black persons, black persons see the
judiciary as more expensive and less honest.
The regression outputs also are consistent with the literature that documents these racial disparities.
Some studies show that minority group members are more distrustful and less confident in the police
and the courts (Huang and Vaughn, 1996; Lasley, 1994; Schumann, Steeh, Bobo, and Krysan, 1997).
These minority concerns are largely fueled by issues of racial profiling (Cole, 1999; Kennedy, 1997).
One way to interpret these results is that they reflect black persons’ perception of the legitimacy of
the laws. That is, they tend to have seen the rules themselves as biased. Additionally, some studies
show that black Brazilians suffer significant discrimination. Twine (1998), Reichmann (1999),
Burdick (1998), Sheriff (2000), and Bailey, Loveman and Muniz (2013) have provided some
evidence of racism experienced by black Brazilians. Furthermore, according to the MNDH
(Movimento Nacional de Direitos Humanos) the federal police apparatus killed three times more
black persons than non-black persons in 1997.
The BCJI results regarding the question of trust in the judiciary show that people with high incomes
have higher levels of trust in the judicial system. They regard Brazilian justice as more politically
independent, less expensive, and easier to access than do lower-income Brazilians. These results are
consistent with the literature that suggests that richer or more powerful individuals are treated
differently than those without such resources (Bennack, 1999).
We also obtained evidence that people with more years of formal schooling exhibit higher levels of
trust in the judicial system. The coefficient implies that a one year of additional formal schooling
predicts a 0.71 basis point increase (statistically significant at the 1% level) in the BCJI. Our results
suggest that as schooling increases, then so do the perceptions of legal costs, political independence,
and honesty of the judiciary, although the perception of its ability to resolve disputes decreases. Jones,
Weatherburn, and McFarlane (2008) present evidence that trust in the criminal justice system is
generally more prevalent among younger people, among those who are better educated, and among
those with higher incomes. They also found that respondents who earned higher annual incomes were
more confident that the judicial system is effective in bringing people to the courts, meeting the needs
of victims, respecting the rights of the accused, and treating the accused fairly. Benesh (2006) also
shows that people who reported that they knew more about the courts were more likely to trust them,
as were people who had higher levels of schooling.
In terms of experience with the judiciary, our results indicate that people who have had previous
experience present levels of trust 11.07 basis points lower than people who have had no previous
experience with the judiciary (with significance at the 1% level). For these respondents, although the
judiciary is more politically independent and easily accessible, it is also slower and more expensive
when compared to people who have had no previous experience with the judiciary. These results are
similar to those of Salzman and Ramsey (2013).
Finally, we found that people with greater knowledge of the judiciary trust it more. These results
indicate that people with knowledge about the judiciary present 17.36 basis points higher levels of
trust (with significance at the 10% level). Nonetheless, these findings may relate to knowledge of the
law itself, as opposed to of the procedures of the judicial system. Furthermore, these results are
consistent with Gibson et al. (1998) and Benesh (2006), who present evidence that knowledge about
the judicial system has a significant relationship with trust in the courts.

In column (1) the dependent variable is the BCJI, which has a range between 0 and 10 . It is the average of a set of nine questions covering the main aspects of trust in the judicial
system. In columns (2), (3), …, (10), we set out the questions used in the BCJI, where the respondent is required to issue his or her opinion on the judicial system regarding: trust
(2) ; speed in resolving disputes (3); access cost (4); ease of access (5); political independence (6); honesty (7); ability to resolve disputes (8); panorama of the last 5 years (5); and
expectation for the next 5 years (10).

4.2.Confidence in the Judicial System and Propensity to seek the Judiciary

We also assessed the relationship between trust in the judicial system and propensity to resort to
the judiciary in six hypothetical situations. The ensuing behavior index was based on a set of
questions whereby respondents stated how likely it is that they would resort to the judiciary to
resolve a hyphotetical dispute or problem. The possible answers to those questions being: (i)
definitely not, (ii) probably not, (iii) probably yes, and (iv) definitely yes. The behavior index is
thus a measure of the population’s perception of their own propensity to use the court system.
Appendix A.2.3 presents details regarding index construction.
The index is built on cases concerning family issues (C1), provision of service issues (C2),
consumer issues (C3), neighborhood issues (C4), labor disputes (C5), and a case involving the
government (C6). We also took into account situations in which people from very different income
levels and social groups share the same experience, as well as hypothetical scenarios in which the
respondents were asked to imagine themselves on different sides in the dispute. At one juncture,
for instance, the respondent plays the role of the consumer, with a weaker position, whereas in
another scenario the interviewee is the service provider, having thus a stronger position.
Analogously to equation (1), we adjusted a model including demographic and economic variables
to shed some light on drivers for the Behavior Index. We ran Pooled Ordinary Least Squares
(Pooled OLS) regressions. The Behavior Index for the respondent 𝑖 that was surveyed in the period
𝑡 (𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖,𝑡 ) is modeled as:

𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐵𝐶𝐽𝐼𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐹𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖,𝑡 +

                                             ′
                                                 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 (5)

We included also an additional set of control variables, such as state, quarter, employment, and
                                     ′
marital status dummies (included in 𝑥𝑖,𝑡 , which is a column vector of control variables).

Table.8 shows a positive relationship between trust in the judicial system and the behavior index,
in clear support of our hypothesis that people with higher levels of trust in the judicial system
have a higher propensity to resort to the judiciary. Hence, our behavior index is more adequately
termed the “trust realization index”. The Pooled OLS coefficient implies that a one unit increase
in the BCJI predicts a 7.8 basis point increase in the behavior index (with significance at the 1%
level). In general, people have a higher propensity to seek the judiciary in cases concerning family
issues, neighborhood issues, labor disputes, and cases involving the government. Underlying this
result is the fact that the respondents see the justice system as a legitimate stage for the resolution
of their disputes.

Our results also show that there is a positive and statically significant correlation between the
behavior index and some demographic and economic variables such as being female, being black,
age, schooling years, previous experience with the judiciary, and knowledge about the justice
court system. Our estimations indicate that although the judiciary has lower levels of the trust for
some demographic and economic variables, most Brazilians perceive it as a legitimate way to seek
solutions to their problems and would not hesitate to go to court to solve them. For example,
although women generally have lowers levels of trust in the judicial system than men, they are
more likely to seek the judiciary for family, labor, and service issues, but less likely to seek it for
consumer issues. We find similar results regarding age and previous experience with the judiciary.
These results are statistically significant at the 1% level.

Lambsdorff (1999) argues that the keys to less corruption and greater trust are an effective system
of property rights and the rule of law. If the law is enforced on fair grounds, then people will be
more likely to obey the law and to trust the judicial system. In contrast, if people feel that they are
treated unfairly, then they will rely less the courts and will be less likely to obey the laws. Higher-
trusting societies have better governance and faster economic growth. They also spend more on
redistribution and have greater respect for the law (Uslaner, 2002).

six questions whereby respondents stated how likely they would be to resort to the judiciary to resolve a dispute or
problem, the possible answers to those questions being: (i) definitely not, (ii) probably not, (iii) probably yes, and (iv)
definitely yes. The behavior index is thus a measure of the population’s perception of its own propensity to go to
court to resolve disputes. In columns (2), (3), …, (7), we set out the hypothetical questions used in the Behavior

Finally, we also studied the connection between trust in the judicial system and willingness to
go to court by applying pseudo-panel techniques to available cross-sectional data. Recently
pseudo-panel methods have been used to overcome some of the known limitations of cross
sectional data; they allow for example to control for unobservable characteristics of survey
respondents.

Our pseudo-panel builds on the same waves of the survey conducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012.
We draw largely on the methodology set forth by Verbeek and Vella (2005) and Verbeek (2007)
to determine the sizes of the cohorts as well as the variables chosen to construct the cohorts.
Our cohorts are based on the ages and the years of education of the respondents. Verbeek (2007)
argues that suitably choosing these variables is essential for maintaining the asymptotic
properties of the pseudo-panel. Our cohorts partition the ages of the respondents into five-year
intervals, including only individuals aged between 18 and 72. We select the following 7 groups
according to schooling years: 0-3 years, 4 years, 5-7 years, 8 years, 9-10 years, 11 years, and
12 years or more. After defining the cohorts, a set of other variables is combined into the dataset,
including a pool of demographic and economic variables such as race, income, age, gender,
schooling years, and all questions related to the main aspects of trust in the judicial system.
Based on this data structure we generate the pseudo-panels by averaging all variables at the
cohort level.

Our pseudo-panel is formed creating synthetic observations obtained from averaging real
observations with similar characteristics in a sequence of repeated cross sectional data sets. In
this way, the synthetic units of observations can be thought as being “followed” over time. The
model then requires an appropriate modification:

where the individual index, i, has been replaced by a cohort index, c and 𝛼̅𝑐 is the fixed effect
                                                                                        ′
parameter. Analogously to equation (5), the slope 𝛽1 is the parameter of interest and 𝑥̅𝑐,𝑡 is a vector
of control variables.

                               Figure.2 shows the cohort sizes. We have 77 cohorts with an
average of 219 and a median of 189 observations per cohort. The minimum and maximum

Table.9 lays out the basic descriptive statistics of the pseudo-panel for all questions and
demographic and economic variables of the constructed cohorts. The average BCJI in 2010 was
4.17. It jumped to 4.28 in 2011 and then slightly increased to 4.31 in 2012. So overall the BCJI
has not changed much over time. This result is due to the low variation among the answers to the
questions that constitute the index. Something similar happened with the behavior index: its
average in 2010 was 6.95, then increased to 7.08 in 2011, and then decreased to 7.00 in 2012.

Table.10 reinforces our previous findings as to a positive connection between trust and its practical
realization. The coefficient of the BCJI is positive and statistically strong. The RE coefficient
implies that a one unit increase in the BCJI predicts a 30 basis point increase in the behavior index
(with significance at the 1% level). When controlled for unobserved effects of each cohort (FE)
this coefficient is lower, but still statistically significant at the 5% level.

5. Conclusion

This paper relies on a series of waves of the FGV survey to provide further insight into the
determinants of the various degrees of trust in the judicial system in Brazil over 2010-2012, as
well as into their implications in terms of actual resort to the judicial system. We develop a
measure of judicial performance in Brazil that is based on the motivations behind people’s trust
or distrust on the country’s judicial system. The resulting index performs well as a measure of the
population´s views on the reliability of the Brazilian justice system.

Our findings support the view that race and gender are important predictors once controlled for
other characteristics of respondents. Black persons and women have a slightly lower level of trust
in the judicial system. People who have had previous experience with the judiciary also tend to
trust the judicial system less. On the other hand, better-educated individuals and individuals better
acquainted with the judicial system trust it more. In particular, our results show that a highly
educated individual with some understanding of the judicial system – and consequently
heightened deference towards governmental institutions – will have the highest levels of trust in
the judicial system. On the other extreme, the lowest levels of trust are exhibited by persons who
have been less exposed to formal education, who are female, who are black, and who are skeptical
about government institutions. These results are quite intuitive and confirm some interesting
notions about what drives trust in the judicial system. In present days it is essential that the judicial
system consider carefully what drives support for its institutions.

In addition to the abovementioned conclusions, we also found evidence of a positive relationship
between trust in the judicial system and the behavior index (the “trust realization index”), the latter
being a measure of people’s perception about their propensity to actually go to court to resolve
their disputes. That is, people who have higher levels of trust in the judicial system are more likely
to use its services. We determined furthermore that being female, being black, being older, being
better educated, having previous experience with the judiciary, and being knowledgeable about
the court system are all positively correlated with the trust realization index. Somewhat
surprisingly, although these people have lower levels of trust in the judiciary, they are more likely
to seek the judiciary in some hypothetical situations such as cases concerning family issues,
provision of service issues, consumer issues, neighborhood issues, labor disputes, and cases
involving the government. Despite their misgivings about the judicial system these people do
perceive it as a legitimate venue for seeking solutions to their problems and do not hesitate to go
to court in order to solve disputes.

Finally, our findings point to other important implications of trust in the judicial system. Given
that black persons and women exhibit lower levels of the trust, efforts should be made to reduce
costs of judicial services, thus entailing greater access to the judicial system as well as a greater
sense of fairness. Our findings also show that people with low income have lower levels of the
trust in the judicial system. Nonetheless, our results should be viewed as provisory conclusions of
an empirical analysis on some of the determinants of trust in the Brazilian judicial system. Further
and more accurate estimates and measures of trust institutional are needed if we truly want to
better tackle the influence of other aspects on trust in the judicial system.
