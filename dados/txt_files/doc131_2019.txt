                                                 ABSTRACT
         The financial intermediary sector has big importance for developing countries. The main theories
and hypotheses of industrial organization literature seek to analyze the bank market as profit-maximizing
and wealth-generating. However, bank does not is a regular firm, because there is the social expectation
under efficiency in its function of intermediation. At this point we raise the hypothesis that there is a positive
relationship between market power and the demand behaviors, and we draw the objective of measuring the
size of the deadweight-loss generated annually by the conduct of the banks in Brazil. Thus, we apply Daskin
(1991) approach together with price elasticity of demand that we estimate utilizing the Berry (1994)
procedure for the Time Deposit and Saving deposit segments and Berry Levinsonh and Pakes (1995) for
the Loans segment. As a result, we find that the deadweight-loss produced by commercial banks in these
segments oscillates between 0.29% to 0.42% of average annual Gross Domestic Product or between 7% to
13% of average total revenue of the banking sector. The paper also brings the evolution of price elasticity
of demand over 2009-2016 years for whole Brazil and its five macro-regions, besides of price elasticity of
this period of each county on what there is a bank branch.

                                                  RESUMO
        O setor de intermediação financeira tem grande importância para os países em desenvolvimento. As
principais teorias e hipóteses da literatura de Organização Industrial buscam analisar o mercado bancário a
partir da ótica contábil considerando essas firmas maximizadoras de lucro e geradoras de riqueza. No
entanto, os bancos não são firmas regulares, pois existe uma expectativa social que permeia a eficiências
destas firmas na intermediação financeira. Neste ponto, a hipótese de que existe uma relação positiva entre
o poder de mercado e o comportamento da demanda é levantada juntamente com o objetivo de auferir o
tamanho do peso-morto gerado anualmente pela conduta dos bancos brasileiros. Para isso, aplica-se a
abordagem de Daskin (1991) auxiliada pela elasticidade preço da demanda estimada por meio do
procedimento de Berry (1994) para os segmentos de Depósito a Prazo e Poupança e Berry Levinsonh and
Pakes (1995) para o segmento de Empréstimos. Dos resultados, verifica-se que a perda de peso-morto
produzida pelos bancos comerciais oscila entre 0,29% a 0,42% da média anual do PIB ou entre 7% e 13%
da receita média total do setor bancário. O artigo também apresenta a evolução da elasticidade preço da
demanda ao longo dos anos 2009-2016 para todo o Brasil e para as cinco macrorregiões, além da
distribuição da elasticidade média deste período para cada município onde existe uma agência bancária.

     1. INTRODUCTION
        The current approach of the industrial organization brings as consensus that the researcher should
not be treat the financial intermediation like an ordinary market. Since that banks must make decisions
about risk and diversification, the relationship with managers of small firms seems to be the better way to
reduce costs (Petersen & Rajan, 1994). Thus, the essence of financial intermediation is twofold: increase
the banking competition through excessive risk-taking by banks; and, or, allocate the resources in large
portfolios and to reduce costs through diversification. However, neither of these two extremes can generate
an efficient financial system (Allen & Gale, 2004). The maximum economics welfare is one whose the
aggregate investment is a result of the effective multiplication of means of payment wherein the bank will
no refuse good project, and both, the banker and investor, will maximize their surpluses (Yanelle, 1989).
        This is the case in most developed economies, but it is still somewhat obscure in developing
countries. The crisis sequence initiated by Mexico in 1994 (followed by the East Asia in 1997, Russia and
Brazil in 1998 and Argentina in 2001) showed the fragility of the financial system of these countries depend
on foreign investment. The development of this crisis sequences culminated in a period of large margins
for Latin American banks, which began to divide the resources available for loans destined to the private
sector or destined to the public sector (Chortareas, Girardone, & Garza-García, 2010). The need to finance
government expenditures may, at some relative risk, shift available resources putting some strain on highly
leveraged firms or to generate working capital shortages that amplify the market frictions (see Bonfim,
2009).
        These working capital shortages represent a cost to society that is referred in industrial organization
and microeconomics literatures as deadweight-loss (DWL). In Latin American, Brazil is the country with
the lowest rate of lending, in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Product), to the private market (Chortareas,
Girardone, & Garza-García, 2010). However, the highest net interest margins make of this country facing
the same problem as the other countries in the region (some degree of distrust of foreign investment). Thus,
the objective of this paper is to analyze the welfare economic due to the conduct of commercial banks
presents in Brazil that act in segments of Loans (LO) and Time Deposits (TD), as well to evaluate the
distribution of price elasticity of demand for county and its evolution for 2009-2016 period at these
segments.
        In Industrial Organization theory, researchers are testing so many theories for regular firms and its
market power. In this context, we have at least three main hypotheses: original efficiency analysis, by
Structure-Conduct-Performance (SCP) hypothesis (see Smirlock, 1985), seeks the positive correlation for
market share-profit relationship that signalizes the main source of market power. However, Shepherd
(1986) proposes the Relative Market Power (RMP), that adds the concentration variable in the explanatory
equation of profit together with market share, under the assumptions that market power occurs
independently of any source of domination. A third hypothesis is Quiet Life (QLH – initially proposed by
Hicks, 1935) that indicates that an increase in the market power brings a decrease in efficiency and so an
impossibility of a bank earning higher profitability. In QLH, the efficiency is key for explicating the
profitability and three points are central: allocation optics, production dimension and scale dimension (see
e.g. Fiordelisi, 2004). To refute or accept Quiet Life Hypotheses talks with to refute or accept Competition-
Fragility and Competition-Stability hypotheses. These last two hypotheses are specifically for bank
literature and indicates that an increase in competition, decreases the bank efficiency and increase financial
fragility for first and an increase in competition, promotes an increase in financial efficiency and increase
stability in the financial intermediation sector for second.
        We understand that all these hypotheses concern with the accounting of firms (profitability
generation or shareholder wealth and its consequences for other banks). Notwithstanding, bank is not a
regular firm because it participates from the financial intermediation sector and, besides efficiencies, banks
also exert the development paper. Thus, we propose to test is if the increase of deadweight-loss is positively
correlated with increase of market power of bank (Lerner-Demand Hypothesis). In Short, these hypotheses
are based in monopoly theory, where a monopolistic firms act in the elastic region of demand and, if the

deadweight loss generates by banks in each county is true, the correlation between market power (Lerner
Index) and elasticities-price of demand, in absolute terms, should be positive2 and significative.
         In the banking literature of welfare analysis, Rhoades (1972) estimated the market power profit to
monopoly banking over 2,000 markets (1,635 and 194 of 2,466 counties and 281 SMSAs of United States,
respectively) and founded a welfare-loss around $11.9m of dollars. However, Rhoades followed the
Harberger (1954) with partial equilibrium, assuming a constant unit elasticity of demand. From this
position, this author ignored the very differences of the banks and acts place in the market concentration
that may generate a bias in analysis. We propose to correct this bias assuming the procedure of Daskin
(1991) allied with the approach of Berry (1994) for calculating the price elasticity of demand. In the Lerner
Index cost we considered the Fundação Instituto de Pesquisa Contábeis, Autuariais e Financeiras
(FIPECAFI, Foundation for Actuarial and Financial Accounting in English, 2004) report.
         Maudos & Guevara (2007) analyzed the relationship between market power, in loan and deposit
segments, and X-efficiency for EU-15 countries in period of 1993-2002. The authors founded that welfare-
loss in 2002 was 0.54% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In line with Rhoades, Solís & Maudos (2008)
used the Harberger’s triangle for Mexican banking between 1993-2005 and founded that the social cost
attributable to market power in 2005 was 0.15% of Mexican GDP. The analysis of these authors assumes
that banks competes via outputs. In this point, we argue that these analyses may fail in market whose banks
do not compete as a Cournot market or when the analysis do not consider the outside good in decision of
agents, because the financial intermediation is compounded by banks, credit unions, Grameen bank and so
on. Berry (1994) procedure, in calculating the price elasticity of demand, assume the theory of indirect
utility of demand, where a consumer chose to demand deposits or loans through a set of bank factors. These
technical features are like a transitive basket and satisfies the hypotheses of consumer theory. Therefore,
we are assuming that a determined bank adopts it strategic considering what of the other banks that are
adopting in market, like a theoretical Cartel structure.
         Finally, Silva and Lucinda (2017) analyzed structure of market from switching cost view and found
that the relationship, between bank and costumer, produces an average cost of R$ 471,17 (four hundred
seventh-one and seventeen cents of Reais) per account. We complement this analyzes with DWL calculated
from ESTBAN (Data base of Central Bank of Brazil that brings banking statistic for Brazilian counties and
bank branch). Thus, we contributed by mapping the distribution of the elasticities for whole Brazilian
counties, where commercial banks act. We also present the evolution over time of elasticities throughout
2009-2016 period. As a result, we find that the DWL produced by financial institutions in the downstream
segments oscillates around about 0.30% of Brazilian GPD annually with the average elasticity. Time
Deposit segment presented the ration DWL/GDP around about 0.06%, while the DWL/GDP ratio for the
loans segment was 0.24%. However, in both, TD and LO segments, the average elasticity is different of the
median elasticity and therefore the DWL do not follows a normal distribution for counties. For this we
present a graph, that summarize the distribution of DWL as elasticity increases. This analyzes indicates a
median elasticity region of 2.0 for Time Deposit segment and a median elasticity region of 3.0 for Loans
segment.
         We structure this paper in more four parts: Section 2 describes the methodology used in the proposed
analysis. This section is subdivided in demand analysis, deadweight-loss analysis and econometric
procedures. Section 3 will be presenting the data. Section 4 discusses the results and issues. A brief
conclusion follows.

    2. METHODOLOGY
       2.1. Stylized facts
       The model begins with indirect utility of demand approach. The methodology procedure is
presented by Berry (1994) and we adapt it to the banking sector where the consumers are interested in
purchasing Saving Deposit (sv), Time Deposit (td) or Loans (l) services in m Brazilians counties’ markets
(m = 1, ..., M) of j financial institutions (j = 0, …, J) in time t.

         2
           This point is positive in a direct analyze, theoretically the Lerner index is equal the inverse of elasticity in absolute
term. In this view the relationship should be negative.
                                                                                                                                  2
        The researcher observes the individuals I (i = 1, ... Im) in aggregate forms by counties and your
choices are view like a market share of each bank in these counties. However, the choices j = 0 (zero) means
the outside-good allocation of consumer money. Is a like paper Money Held by the Public calculated in a
Monetary Economic approach. This raises some implications for the relevant market because the individual
may live in city m=i and have a bank account in county m=j (for i≠j).
        Thus, our relevant market is based on the microregions defined by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia
e Estatística (IBGE or Brazilian Institute of Statistics and Geography in English). For to compute the market
shares with outside-good in each microregion, we considerate the total of remuneration presents in these
localities (sums of wages of formal workers, pensions and government aids) as weighting of the stock
variables (monthly balance of TD, SD and LO segments) disclosed by Banco Central do Brasil (BCB,
Central Bank of Brazil in English).

where pjmt is the price that the bank j to remunerate for the TD market; 𝑝𝑗𝑚𝑡 is the administration rate of

the TD incurred on the product of bank j and the 𝑝𝑗𝑚𝑡      is the loans price of bank j to consumers I; 𝑥𝑗𝑚𝑡
represents a vectors line of observable K dimension features and; 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 is the random mean zero disturbance.
The angular coefficients 𝛼 𝑙 𝛼 𝑡𝑑 , 𝛼 𝑎𝑑 e 𝛽 summarizes consumer preferences.

        Like Berry (1994), we suppose that term of error 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 is type 2 (two) i.i.d. with the “extreme value”
distribution function exp (-exp (-ε)). Thus, the predict share of bank j for the three products (here appraised)
is then given by the well-known logit formula:
                  𝑢
 𝑡𝑑              𝑒 𝑗
𝑠𝑗𝑚𝑡 =           𝐽                                                                   (3.1)

𝑠𝑗𝑚𝑡 =           𝐽                                                                   (3.3)
             1+∑𝑘=1 𝑒 𝑢𝑘


       The linearization of the Accumulated Logistic Distribution Function (FDA) allows us to find
probability of the consumer i choose the bank j through the observable characteristics of each institution.
Therefore, the demand equations are as follows:

𝑙𝑛(𝑠𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑑 ) − 𝑙𝑛𝑠0𝑡𝑡𝑑    𝑎𝑑 𝑎𝑑
                     = 𝑝𝑗𝑡 𝛼 + 𝑝𝑗𝑡𝑡𝑑 𝑡𝑑

       The correlations presented by error of type 2 (two) listed above are due to the characteristics of the
banks that are perceived by the individuals and highlighted by the BCB. Thus, we controlled this bias by
three nested that resumes the features of banks. These categories are: commercial banks, public banks and
multiple banks. By including these groups, the demand equation becomes:

       2.3.The Deadweight-Loss
       In this paper, the DWL method of Daskin (1991) will use the elasticities estimated in equations (5.x)
and (7.x). In theory, it is a demand with constant elasticity (isoelastic – price elasticity means of 2009-2016
period) determined by:

the price elasticity of demand. P is the price of the homogeneous product. Therefore, an industry with N

       After a sequence of algebraic manipulations, we arrive at the equation (14) that can be rewriting in

     In equation (14), the sj is the share presented by equations (3.x) and |ϵ| is elasticity-price of demand.
Remember that default Lerner Index is L= [P(Q)-C]/P(Q). Thus, the equation (15) can be rewriting in:

       Equation (16) will be all the greater the greater the share of financial institution j. Intuitively, the
DWL is the area whose producer surplus do not cover consumer surplus losses, when the firm increases
your price. That is, the DWL is represented by the difference between the reduction in consumer surplus
and the increase in producer surplus, when the producer ceases to be competitive and becomes a monopolist
(HARBERGER, 1954). To calculate this area, we can use the integral presented by equation (18).

are considered cartelized or in those whose observed price is above the estimated price for theoretical
Bertrand.
       For to test the hypothesis of positive relationship between market power and price-elasticity of
demand in absolute term we will estimate the following equation:

       𝐿𝑚,𝑡 = 𝜀𝑚,𝑡 + 𝜇𝑚,𝑡                                                          (24)
where L is Lerner index in county m in period t, 𝜀𝑚,𝑡 is the price-elasticity of demand of county m in time
t and 𝜇𝑚,𝑡 is term of error.

         2.4. Econometric Procedures, Instruments and Controls
         Like Berry (1994), the demand equations 4.x and 6.x, will be estimated by Instrumental Variables
(IV). If, the error correlation terms of equations 4.2 (6.2) and 4.3 (6.3) (TD and LO respectively) are strong
enough, the procedure for the estimation will be via Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). However,
if the correlation between two equations is not strong, then, in addition to the estimation by 2SLS, the Berry,
Levinsohn and Pakes (BLP, 1995) procedure will be used.
         We also will perform the endogeneity tests, overidentification (Hansen J statistics) tests, unit-root
(ADF – Augmented Dickey Fuller) testing and weak-instrument (Kleibergen-Paap F statistic) tests. Finally,
we will perform the robust correction of the variance per cluster (microregions).
         The identification of demand is reached by variation in branch bank market shares controlled by
variation in bank features. Thus, we decompose the optimal instruments into five groups:

         •     BLP_1: number of bank branches (all banks), number of specific branches and quantity of
               electronic service stations (ESS) – for all banks;
         •     BLP_2: interaction between the total cost of a bank branch and total number of ESS and the
               interaction between the added value of a specific bank branch and the total number of
               branches in a certain county;
         •     INT_1: interaction between debt index and total number of branches in a county, interaction
               between debt index and the quantity of specific bank branches, interaction between debt index
               and total number of ESSs;
         •     INT_2: ESS density, rival branch density, density of ESS rivals and branch density;
                                                                                                              6
        • Shifter: liquidity index.
        We controlled the remuneration of deposits in determining bank in accordance with the Taylor’s
rule, where the inflation gap is the distance between observed annual inflation and the center of its target,
4,5%, and we considered the municipality output gap as the distance of observed output in period t and the
largest output observed between 2009-2016 period.
        As in BLP procedure, restricting utility parameter to the segment features space and to a polynomial
system is enough to identify the demand. This is important because the bank demand is a function of the
features of all products and this invalidates our confidence in the “exclusion” constraint tests.
        The Lerner-Demand test hypothesis for time deposit and loans will be performed by panel with
fixed effects. The panel season will be performed by time, because the relationship of banks in inter-finance
market in these segments is a source of correlation for this estimate. Thus, we will analyze each Lerner
index and price elasticities by time for whole banks presents in each county in determined time.
        Finally, if the GMM system will be necessary, the estimates are made with on-weight matrix for
each micro-region and year and therefore, the restriction that the covariance between microregions is equal
to zero is forced.

        The CDI-REAL data (𝑝𝑗𝑡𝑑 ) is the net effective annual interest rate, after deducting 15% of Income
Tax3 on the CDI's profitability. In savings there is no incidence of income tax. The management fee (𝑝𝑗𝑎𝑑 )
represents the banks income to manages the “households” resources. It is a result of the division between
the accounts 71700009 and 41500002 of the balance sheet provided by report 4010 of Central Bank of
Brazil. The account services fees (𝑝 𝑠𝑣 ) represent the average traded in the five working days before month
end. The responsibility for information lies with financial institutions. The values of 𝑝 𝑠𝑣 are the
transformation of the available values for the logarithmic scale.

       The first results that we will analyze is for Time Deposit segments. The errors between savings
deposit and time deposit were considered highly correlated (approximately 90%). Thus, the estimated
GMM system assumed the form of the system presented in equation (25). The nests desegregate up to six
equations (three for SD and three for TD) totaling seven equations for model 2 and eleven for model 3.

        In Table 3 the first and second columns are respectively the Logit and Nested Logit models (for
multiple banks only). The third column presents the Nested Logit with three paths: public banks, private
multiple banks and private commercial banks. In addition to the variables presented, controls and
instruments are also part of the regression (econometric procedure sections).
        By results, the demand was identified and is statistically significant. The higher the management
fee the lower the demand for time deposits. Note that given the existence of these management fees, when
the difference between the yields of the CDI and the savings increases, the market share of the time deposits
segment fall. This is because many of the large banks have paid 70 or even 60% of CDI's profitability to
their applicators and there is still the incidence of Income Tax. Thus, the safe deposit is preferable to the
time deposit.

        The analysis of the coefficients of the management fees of the segment on the screen is only a prior
one, since the consumers' sensitivity to the price also depends on the market share of each firm and the
price charged by the financial institutions (since this is not in a logarithmic scale). The price elasticities of
demand for the Time Deposit segment are presented in Table 4.

         After analyzing the Mahalanobis distance, 1% of the elasticity of Bradescard bank was considered outlier, and therefore,
although this bank is available in annex, the elasticities of the above Table did not consider it in the analysis. Elasticities are in
absolute values.

         From results, of Table 4, we have an elastic behavior of demand against management. The price
elasticity of demand, in absolute value, distribution is asymmetric on the left, where the means values for
two first models are concentrated between 25th and 50th percentiles. For 3 Nested Logit model the mean
value is concentrated between 10th and 25th percentiles.
         The demand analysis for LO is presented in Table 5. The LO segment was performed by BLP. At
first glance all validity tests of the instruments were rejected, however, such rejection occurred due to the
number of observations.

         The split of the value of this test (of all models) by the number of observations (OVER / N) shows
that the correlations between second stage residuals and the instruments used are less than 1%. The random
component of GLP was not statistically significant, indicating that local managers do not have much order
to decide on interest rates. Interest rates presented negative coefficients, indicating that the higher the
interest rates, the lower the demand for bank loans and, consequently, the lower the market share of banks
(demand identification).
         The distribution of the absolute elasticities for the LO Segment (Table 6) is asymmetric to the right
for all three estimated models.

       Considering the first model of the five largest banks, Bradesco's demand is the most elastic and
belongs to the range of 75% to 90%. The price elasticity of the demand of banks Itaú-Unibanco, Santander,
Caixa Econômica Federal and Banco do Brazil are between the 50% and 75% percentiles.

       4.2.Deadweight-loss Analysis
       In this part, we will use the elasticities-price of demand in equation (24) to obtain the DWL measure
for TD and LO segments. We also present the hypothesis for both segments of the relationship between
market power and price elasticity of demand. The DWL comparison will be made with GDP and the sums
of profit of five largest downstream banks. While most of European banks are stuck in single digits, in
                                                                                                                          10

In our analysis, the average firm surplus of five largest banks, in three segments, was nearly $31.61 Billion.
        In Table 7, we presented the results of Loans and Time Deposits deadweight-loss. The presentation
of segments was analyzed in each line of the first column. In the second column, we presented the number
of banks analyzed. The deadweight-loss is presented in millions of dollars in the third column. The Brazilian
GDP means between 2009-2016 is presented in the fourth column. In fifth column is the DLW as percentage

        The as ratio of DWL with respect of average GDP for a Time Deposit segment was not negligible.
On average, annually, over one and a half billion ceases to be applied because banks conduct in this
segment. This ratio represents between 0.05% to 0.11% of Brazil's average GDP (2009-2016) or
approximately between 3.26% to 6.90% of average total revenue of banks in this segment. The Loans
segment showed a greater gain in the deadweight-loss measures. Again, the values of the Deadweight are
not negligible and indicate that approximately $7.0 billion are no longer undertaken annually due to the
interest charged by financial institutions. This ratio represents an annual average between 0.24% to 0.31%
of the average GDP or between 3.26% to 6.90% average total revenue of banks in this segment. The values
presented in Table 7 are a median basis, however the distribution of elasticities presented in demand
analysis are asymmetric to right for a Loans segment and to left for Time Deposit segment and each
municipality can be a different price elasticity of demand.
        Figure 1 shows the evolution of the DWL (principal axis) when the price elasticity of demand, in
TD segment, increases (black line). The value of elasticities is for the third model. The secondary axis
allows analyzing the relationship between the number of banks in each municipality and the price elasticity
of demand of these municipalities. The rings are each county and itss positions is with relation to number
of banks. Remember that price-elasticity of demand in TD segment is normalized for 100 thousand people.

       The optimal elasticity, in TD segment, occurs when the bank has inelastic demand. Most counties
have a close elasticity between 2 and 2.5 (mean = median) with several banks ranging from 1 to 8 different
brands. In these counties, the DWL value to go between $1,000 and $1,800 million of dollar. Few
municipalities are on the competitive margins (they present a peculiarity to save regardless of the yield
proposed by the banks).
       In Figure 2, we have the evolution of the DWL for LO segment. Its analysis is the same that in
previous figure. In the case of banks, what is not lent to the households or firms can be directed to the
government financing that in the period presented expenses growing.

       Note that the second order condition of DWL in Figure 2 is greater than zero and that it does not
have a point that touches the competitive market structure. Therefore, given the current characteristics of
the Brazilian banks elasticity, it seems difficult to say that the lending segment is a competitive segment,
as Nakane (2001) stated.
                                                                                                         12
        In addition, Figure 2 also reveals that in most counties have, on average, three brands of banks and
that these municipalities have as characterizing an elasticity that orbits between 3.05 and 3.10. In this point,
the DWL represents about 0.18% of Brazilian GDP (Table 7). This is different of ratio presented in the
median value (Table 7) and indicates that DWL can be at least $1B larger.
        We will present the hypothesis test of the relationship between market power and price elasticities
of demand in Table 8. We perform the test for third model (Three nested logit).

          Note: the test will be performed by panel with time as cluster and counties as observations in each cluster. We have a

        In loans analysis, we have an unbalanced panel for time with 3,493 counties and in the time
deposit segment we also have unbalanced panel fort time with 3,435 counties. The results indicate us, for
both segments, that our hypothesis holds and the relationship between the Lerner index and price
elasticities of demand is positive.
        The evolution of elasticity per year for the Time Deposit segment for whole of Brazil and itss five
regions is in Figure 3. We use the third Model of elasticities to present these evolutions. The behavior of
the elasticities does not change through the models, what changes are only the value of the elasticities. The
five regions present a behavior different from Brazil. The elasticities increase over time, but in non-linear
behavior.

        In northwest region, the increase of elasticity of time deposit bank demand represents a relative
reduction in the market power of banks in this sector. The emergence of other source of financial
investments like increase of BM&F Bovespa participations or forex applications may responds these
variations. However, it is a source for another analyzes. The same question may be applied in another
regions, but the increase of elasticity around the period is not a clear like in the northwest region.,
        The evolution of elasticity per year for the Loans segment for whole of Brazil and the five regions
can be followed in Figure 4. In this segment, the five regions present a same behavior from Brazil. The
elasticities increase over time.

        In Panel A of Figure 5 we can see the relationship presented in Figure 4. The region with more
elastic demand of Brazil is southeast and south. In these regions there is also a greater banking
concentration. The appeal for competition is greater and the existence of surrogates as well. This
relationship shows the effectiveness of financial intermediation for local development. As an example of
interpretation of Figure 5, the counties of the northeast that do not have banks are those located in the
northwest of Bahia and, south of Piauí. The hinterland of this region is the one with the lowest elastic
demand, while the coastal region has a greater sensitivity to the variation of interest rates.
        The results of Panel B of Figure 4 follow the Panel A in places of demand relations. However, the
distribution of elasticities intervals is the most homogenous between the five regions. Note, in figure 3, that
the increase occurs in a small relative interval. The cost region has a more elastic demand, mainly in south,
southeast regions and the Distrito Federal in Midwest region.

        Our result is in line with those found by Maudos and Guevara (2007) for EU-15 countries (0,42%
in the Brazilian case against 0.52% for European banks). However, our values are relatively higher than
those found for Mexico by Solis & Maudos (2008). Silva and Lucinda (2017) shows that switching cost
average duration between the bank and costumer is about 12.2 years. Thus, the Lerner-Demand hypothesis
indicates that an increase of competition endogenously, with increase of credit without political interest,
may to redistribute the demand between the firms, because the price elasticity of the market is limited by
price elasticity of demand and to reduce the lock-in time between bank and costumer or to reduce the cost
of this lock-in effect. As Cardozo, Azevedo and Barboza (2018) show, an increase in bank competition is
associated with a greater supply of credit. In line with our results, this greater credit supply means a
reduction of the social expectative here verified, since more projects will be approved. This relationship
                                                                                                            15

    5. CONCLUDS
        The financial intermediary sector has big importance for developing country. The main theories and
hypotheses of literature seek to analyze the bank market from financial optics. However, bank does not is
a regular firm because there is the social expectation under efficiency in its function of intermediation. At
this point we raise the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between market power and the demand
behaviors, and we draw the objective of measuring the size of the deadweight-loss generated annually by
the conduct of the Brazilian banks. In short, our objective was to measure the size of the Dead Weight-loss
generated annually by the conduct of the Brazilian banks.
        Our results indicate that DWL practice is maintained in practically all counties to which banks
operate. There were 3435 counties analyzed for the Time Deposit segment and 3493 counties for the Loans
segment. The results indicate that the deadweight loss is around 0.5% and 0.11% of the average Gross
Domestic Product of the period 2009 and 2016 for the term deposit segment and between 0.24% and 0.31%
of GDP for the loans segment in the same period. In all segments, Brazil ceases to produce around $8 to
$12 billion of Dollars annually because of the conduct of the banks. Thus, we do not refute our initial
hypotheses that DWL is not significant to test the Lerner-Elasticity relationship.
        This study provides insights in terms of social, financial and economic implications. Our results
indicate that in the period the conduct of banks was in elastic part of demand for almost all counties of
analyzes in both segments (deposits and loans). This is evidence that Lerner-Elasticity hypothesis is true,
but nothing talks about efficiency, and capacity of generating profit in the period. Therefore, it is advisable
that policy makers should concentrate on possible market fail generated by conduct of commercial and
multiple banks. Thus, for continuity of this research, we recommend the test of efficiency, allocative and
scale of banks from Relative Market Power Hypothesis.
