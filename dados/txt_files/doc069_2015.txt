The current Brazilian position on climate change has been formalized with the law of National
Climate Change Policy, which provides a legal framework for national actions aimed at mitigation
and adaptation. Within PNMC, the country has defined its national voluntary reduction targets for
greenhouse gases emissions, with reductions between 36.1% and 38.9% of projected emissions by
2020. The distribution of the corresponding mitigation efforts by regions is of great concern in a large
country like Brazil. In fact, most of Brazilian states have established public policies on climate
change. In this context, questions raised in the literature on global climate change, such as the
environmental responsibility for emissions embodied in trade, also apply at the regional level, and
perhaps even to a larger extent. In order to analyze at regional level the current relationship between
Brazil’s CO2 emissions and domestic and global value chains, in this study we adopt a new
framework that combines a world input-output table with an inter-regional input-output table. Also,
a new database is compiled on Brazilian states’ energy use (by fuel) and related CO2 emissions at
sectoral level, based on states’ official energy balances. We are able to evaluate the CO2 emissions
in each of the 27 Brazilian states, considering their respective productive structure, energy use, as
well as their trade with other states or foreign countries. We find that, in 2008, emissions from the
production of inter-regionally traded goods and services corresponded to 36% of Brazilian CO2
emissions. There is great variation among states concerning their emissions intensities and carbon
content of their trade relationships with their states and foreign countries.

A atual posição do Brasil em relação às mudanças climáticas foi formalizada com a Lei da Política
Nacional sobre Mudança do Clima, que estabeleceu o quadro legal para as ações nacionais voltadas
à mitigação e à adaptação. O país também definiu suas metas voluntárias para redução das emissões
de gases do efeito estufa, entre 36,1% e 38,9% das emissões projetadas para 2020. A distribuição
geográfica dos esforços de mitigação é de grande interesse em um país heterogêneo como o Brasil.
De fato, a maioria dos estados brasileiros estabeleceram políticas oficiais sobre mudanças
climáticas. Nesse contexto, questões levantadas pela literatura sobre mudanças climáticas globais,
tais como a responsabilidade ambiental por emissões incorporadas no comércio internacional,
aplicam-se também em nível regional, possivelmente em ainda maior grau. A fim de analisar em nível
regional a relação entre emissões de CO2 e as cadeias de valor domésticas e globais, nesse estudo
adota-se uma nova abordagem que integra uma matriz de insumo-produto global e uma inter-
regional. Adicionalmente, construiu-se uma nova base de dados para o uso de energia (por tipo de
combustível) e respectiva emissão de CO2 por setor de atividade econômica em cada estado do
Brasil, baseada nos balanços energéticos oficiais. Com isso, torna-se possível avaliar as emissões
de CO2 nos estados, considerando as respectivas estruturas produtivas, de uso de energia, bem como
suas relações comerciais com outros estados e países. Observou-se que as emissões provindas da
produção de bens e serviços comercializados entre os estados corresponderam a 36% das emissões
totais do Brasil, em 2008. Há grande variação entre os estados quanto suas intensidades de emissões,
bem como o conteúdo de carbono de suas relações comerciais com outros estados e países.

1. Introduction

        The Brazilian position on climate change has been formalized with the law of National
Climate Change Policy (PNMC, in Portuguese – Law nº 12 187, dated December 29th, 2009)
which provides a legal framework for national actions aimed at mitigation and adaptation.
Within PNMC, the country has defined its national voluntary reduction targets for greenhouse
gases (GHGs) emissions, advancing from a merely programmatic policy (LUCON;
GOLDEMBERG, 2010) to a legal commitment with clear environmental objectives that should
guide subsequent policymaking. The reductions were defined between 36.1% and 38.9% of
projected emissions by 2020. As indicated by Seroa da Motta (2011), sectoral mitigation
percentages were adopted in the correspondence from Brazil for the Copenhagen Accord in
2010: out of the 38.9% national target, deforestation would be reduced by 24.7%, and the
remaining 15.2% would be divided between energy use (7.7%), agriculture and cattle raising
(6.1%), and other sectors (0.4%).
        The distribution of the corresponding mitigation efforts by regions is of great concern
in a large country like Brazil, with substantial regional variation in economic development,
physical geography, production system, and energy consumption. In fact, Brazil’s 1988
Constitution divides responsibilities for environmental policies and legislation among the three
levels of government (PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA, 2009), and most of Brazilian states have
established public policies on climate change. According to NESA-USP, as of June 2015, out
of the 27 states 16 have established policies and four are underway, having initiated draft
legislation; three others have implemented local forums to dialogue about climate change at
state level. Only Roraima, in the North region, Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe, in
the Northeast region, do not even have climate change forums.
        Four states have mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions: São Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro, in the most developed Southeast region; Mato Grosso do Sul, in the Central-
West region; as well as Paraíba, in the Northeast region. There are also advancements in
municipal climate change policies, the two most populous cities, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro,
have established mandatory targets. However, the mitigation targets are quite different from
each other in Brazil’s subnational climate change policies. This is not a problem in itself and
can be echoing the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” professed by
PNMC at international level. However, there is no coordination concerning the different basis
of measurement (absolute values or intensities in the case of Rio de Janeiro) and
incompatibilities in the baselines (different years of reference, based on inventories or projected
emissions). At sectoral level, only Rio de Janeiro has stated specific targets. These
characteristics reflect that the elaboration process of these subnational policies, which have
autonomously emerged, detached from each other. The incongruity between the targets is
problematic for economic agents, since it is not clear what the sum of national, state, and
municipal targets means to their activities (FÓRUM CLIMA, 2012).
        Thus, although the subnational policies indicate advances toward a less intensive effect
on climate change, there is room for improvement in the regulatory aspects. As stated by
Romeiro and Parente (2011) the main obstacles include the lack of convergence of actions
implemented in the various states in Brazil. There are distinct targets and strategies in the three
spheres of the country – federal, state and municipal – which makes the standardization of
mitigation measures and its respective monitoring more difficult and less effective.
        This criticism is not exclusive to Brazil, but also applied to other countries where
subnational climate policies have emerged. Literature concerning these policies have flourished
in the last years, when subnational governments have taken the lead to tackle climate change in
many countries, such as the United States (LUTSEY; SPERLING, 2008; SCHREURS, 2008).
Although there are advantages for engagement of subnational governments in climate change
                                                                                                                  3


policies – such as greater flexibility to implement new policies (PUPPIM DE OLIVEIRA,
2009), and the attaining of efficiency gains from exploitation of local heterogeneities
(SOMANATHAN et al, 2014) – most of literature agrees about the possibility of problems of
coordination and complementarity, besides questioning their institutional capacity to take
action in such policies. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment
Report states that, since there are several limiting factors to a widespread reliance on
subnational levels of government, “a federal structure that provides coordination and enables
an easier transmission of climate policies throughout the agents of the economy is likely to
increase the effectiveness of actions against climate change” (SOMANATHAN et al, 2014, p.
1183).
        The coordination from top-down policies is also fundamental for dealing with an
important aspect of the climate issue that has been overlooked by policy settings within all
levels, which is the relationship between trade and greenhouse gases emissions. It is
fundamental to consider the connections between economies, as trade links production and
consumption in different regions. As stated by Peters et al (2011), ignoring these connections
might result in a misleading analysis of underlying driving forces of emission trends and
mitigation policies. Questions raised in the literature on global climate change, such as the
environmental responsibility for emissions embodied in trade (e.g. VALE et al (2015);
DOUGLAS; NISHIOKA (2012); WIEBE et al (2012); PETERS et al (2011); DAVIS;
CALDEIRA (2010); NAKANO et al (2010); SERRANO; DIETZENBACHER (2010);
HERTWICH; PETERS (2008)), also apply at the regional level, and perhaps even to a larger
extent.
        This paper analyzes the relationship between Brazilian states’ CO2 emissions and inter-
regional and international trade. In doing so, we aim to contribute to policies that account for
such inter-relationships among regions. In this paper, we adopt a forward perspective (MENG
et al, 2015) in analyzing the relationship between CO2 emissions and trade. That is, we aim to
understand the responsibility of consumers for emissions embodied in trade, evaluating what
amount of emission generated by a state is for its own final consumption or for other states and
foreign countries.
        A major difficulty for subnational climate change policies in Brazil is that there are very
few published official inventories (even though, in general, all state policies indicate their
formulation). At state level, to the best of our knowledge, only Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais,
Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo have published comprehensive GHGs inventories 1. Yet
their periodicity differs, and the adopted methodologies are not entirely consistent to each other.
For example, how each inventory proposes accounting for emissions due to freight originating
in the state with destination to other state (FÓRUM CLIMA, 2012). In other to deal to some
extent with this problem, in this study we quantify CO2 emissions in each of the 27 states of
Brazil, in the year 2008. However, we share a limitation with most of literature2 that analyzes
the relationship between international trade and GHGs emissions: we account here for CO2
emissions due only to energy use (combustion of fossil fuels).
        According to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) (2014), in
2008 energy use accounted for about 18% of total GHGs emissions in Brazil. However, the

1
  Other states have published official inventories that comprehend only some emission sectors: Amazonas (electric
power sector), Bahia (energy sector and industrial processes). Although comprehensive, the inventory of Acre
covers only electric power generation and emissions from automobiles in the energy sector.
2
  For example, Douglas and Nishoka (2012), Wiebe et al (2012), Davis and Caldeira (2010), and Nakano et al
(2010) account only for CO2 emissions due to combustion of fossil fuels, as we do in this study. Peters et al (2011)
also consider CO2 emissions from cement production .and gas flaring. Hertwich and Peters (2009) consider GHGs,
not including the sources and sinks of land-use change, which is the same as in the WIOD project. Besides the
absence of data on land-use change and other GHGs with the necessary detail, the authors indicate that other
sources present difficulties for allocation to economic activities.

climate impact of the energy sector is foreseen to grow in the next years. Decree nº 7 390, dated
December 9th, 2010, which regulates PNMC, presents official projections for GHGs emissions
in Brazil, for the year 2020. According to them, the GHGs emissions due to energy use are
estimated to be 868,000 Gg in 2020 (about 140% larger than in 2008), amounting in 27% of
total projected GHGs emissions. In fact, data of recent years show an even more relevant
participation of emissions due to energy use. In 2012, it accounted for about 37% of total GHGs
emissions (MCTI, 2014), given the sharp decline of emissions due to land-use change especially
in Amazon region, from 2009. Given the increasing importance of energy use for the Brazilian
GHGs scenario and its central role in global emissions, its climate impact and their relationship
with the economic activities must be studied.
        Besides this Introduction, this paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents the
methodology used in the empirical analysis, as well as the newly compiled database. Results
are then analyzed in section 3. Then, the last section presents some our concluding remarks.

2. Methodology

2.1. Estimating the country-state input-output table

        In order to analyze at regional level the current relationship between Brazil’s CO2
emissions and domestic and global value chains, in this study we adopt the framework proposed
by Dietzenbacher et al (2013) for combining a world input-output table (WIOT) with an inter-
regional input-output table (IRIOT), thus estimating a country-state input-output table for
Brazil. In this approach, we do not to take one of the datasets (say the WIOT) as a starting point
and adapt the other dataset (i.e. the IRIOT) accordingly, instead we construct input coefficients
for which both datasets are used.
        For the empirical application, we will use the WIOT for 2008 that was constructed in
the WIOD project (see Dietzenbacher et al, 2013b).3 It is a full inter-country input-output table
covering 40 countries and the rest of the world as a 41 st “country”.4 One of the countries
included is Brazil. The IRIOT for 2008 is for Brazil and covers the 27 Brazilian states
(GUILHOTO et al, 2010). Both the WIOT and the IRIOT were aggregated to 28 compatible
industries.

2.2. CO2 emissions data for Brazilian states

        In this paper, we account for CO2 emissions due to fossil fuels5 in the economic sectors.
It also embodies the CO2 emissions that are generated in thermal power plants, as well as that
from the use of coke in iron and steel mills. Adopting a bottom-up approach, we were able to
obtaining the levels of CO2 emissions by industry at the state level in Brazil. For the other
countries in our model, we have considered the data on CO2 emission from the WIOD project.
        First, we have departed from the Brazilian Energy Balance (EPE, 2009) and reconciled
the data from state energy balances accordingly. For the year 2008, official energy balances are
available for the following states: Alagoas, Bahia, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São

available at: http://www.wiod.org/database/index.htm.

  The countries in the WIOD’s world input-output tables are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,

  The following fuels were taken into account: natural gas, steam coal, metallurgical coal, diesel oil, fuel oil,
gasoline, LPG, kerosene, gas coke, coal coke, other oil by-products, and coal tar.

Paulo, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul. For Ceará and Espírito Santo, we have considered the
participation in the national energy use and sectors’ fuel structure from the energy balances of
2007 and 2010, respectively.
        Following Montoya et al (2014), the data on fossil fuel use (in tOE) from the energy
balances was then reconciled with the industry classification of Brazil’s IRIOT. Next, we have
estimated the corresponding CO2 emissions by adopting the carbon emission factors and
oxidation fractions from the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of
Greenhouse Gases (MCTI, 2010).
        By adopting this approach, about 75% of Brazil’s CO2 emissions due to energy use in
2008 were attributed to the ten aforementioned states that publish official energy balances. The
differences from the national total by sector were allocated to the other states according to their
respective gross output.
        In our application, the CO2 emissions due to households’ direct use of fossil fuels are
disregarded (approximately 9% of the national emissions). Instead, we focus on the emissions
that are generated by the various economic industries in their productive activities.

2.3. Trade in CO2 emissions (TiCE)

        To investigate the inter-regional (and international) spillover of CO2 emissions, we
adapt and apply the concept of trade in value added (TiVA) for our country-state input-output
system.
        From the basic Leontief model, the total output of an economy can be expressed as the
sum of intermediate consumption and final consumption (MILLER; BLAIR (2009)) as
        𝐱 = 𝐀𝐱 + 𝐲                                                                              (1)
                −𝟏
        (𝐈 − 𝐀 ) = 𝐁                                                                            (2)
        𝐱 = 𝐁𝐲                                                                                  (3)
where 𝐱 is the n×1 total output vector (n is the number of industries in the system), 𝐀 is the
n×n direct input coefficients matrix, 𝐲 is the n×1 final demand vector, and 𝐁 is the Leontief
inverse matrix.
        Considering 𝐂 as the n×n diagonal matrix of CO2 emissions coefficients, we can
describe the CO2 emissions related input-output model as:
        𝐯 = 𝐂𝐱                                                                                  (4)
from (3):
        𝐯 = 𝐂𝐁𝐲                                                                                 (5)
        𝐂𝐁 = 𝐆                                                                                  (6)
        𝐯 = 𝐆𝐲                                                                                  (7)
where 𝐯 is the n×1 CO2 emissions vector, and 𝐆 is the CO2 emissions related Leontief inverse.
        In our empirical analysis, we applied a state-country input-output model. In this case,
the above system can be expanded, considering r states / countries, in such a way that it is
possible to estimate the contribution of the final demand in each state / country to the total CO2
emission of a given state / country. In this way, the dimensions of the above matrices and vectors
become: a) 𝐗, 𝐘, and 𝐕, size [(r.n) × r]; b) 𝐀, 𝐁, and 𝐆, size (r.n) × (r.n).
        With the aim of analyzing the state / country interdependence in terms of CO2 emission,
the matrix 𝐆 above can be decomposed as follows:
         𝐆11 … 𝐆1r            𝐆11 … 𝟎               𝟎 … 𝐆1r
        [ ⋮     ⋱    ⋮ ]=[ ⋮        ⋱      ⋮ ]+[ ⋮       ⋱      ⋮ ]                             (8)
         𝐆 r1   … 𝐆   rr       𝟎 … 𝐆        rr     𝐆 r1  … 𝟎
        In equation (8), the elements of the first term of the sum can be regarded as intra-regional
effects, representing impacts on the CO2 emissions of sectors of a region due to exogenous
changes in final demand of the same region. On the other hand, the elements of the second term
                                                                                                               6


of the sum can be regarded as spillover effects, representing impacts on the CO2 emissions of
sectors of a region due to exogenous changes in final demand of the other region.
        In a state-country input-output framework, equation (7) can be represented as:
                            𝐆11 … 𝐆1r
        [𝐯∙1 … 𝐯∙r ] = [ ⋮        ⋱    ⋮ ] [𝐲∙1 … 𝐲∙r ]                                    (9)
                            𝐆 r1  … 𝐆   rr
        In the above equation, considering for example region 1, the vector 𝐯∙1 [(r.n) × 1]
represents the contribution of region 1 to the total CO2 emissions in each one of the r states /
countries and n sectors considered in the model, given the final demand 𝐲∙1 of this region.
        The vector 𝐯∙1 in equation (9) comprehends the inflows / imports6 of CO2 emissions of
region 1 from other states / countries (besides its own contribution for its own value added,
given by the elements from 1 to n). For example, the elements from n+1 to 2n correspond to its
inflows / imports of CO2 emissions from each of the n sectors of region 2 (accordingly, the
outflows / exports of CO2 emissions from region 2 to region 1). Thus equation (9) represents
the consumption-based accounting principle with the multiregional input-output method (see
PEI et al (2015); PETERS et al (2011); DAVIS; CALDEIRA (2010)).

3. Main results

3.1. Traded components of global CO2 emissions

         As can be expected for a country as heterogeneous as Brazil, the values of traded
components of CO2 emissions vary greatly among the Brazilian states, as Table 1 7 presents.
The states in the Southeast region (Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo)
presented the greatest sums of domestically consumed, inter-regionally and internationally
traded CO2 emissions. They amounted in respectively 54%, 52% and 59% of the country’s
total. São Paulo’s shares were the largest, except concerning the exports of CO2 emissions to
foreign countries, in which Minas Gerais took the lead.
         Considering the results for TiCE in Brazil in relation to those of other countries globe,
its figures are quite small. Concerning the relationship of Brazilian states and foreign countries,
as seen in the second and third columns of Table 1, the largest amounts of exports to and imports
from Brazilian states corresponded to countries that are not individually treated in our model
(i.e. the “rest of the world” region). However, it is notable that China’s exports of CO2 to
Brazilian states represented almost 30% of this component.
         From the TiCE results, as highlighted in Chart 1, we have quantified the importance of
international trade in global CO2 emissions. In 2008, 28% of global CO2 emissions, or 6.6 Gt
CO2, were attributed to international trade. This is close to the findings of other authors
(PETERS et al (2011): 26%; DAVIS; CALDEIRA (2010): 23%). China’s exports of CO2
emissions alone represented 31% of the internationally traded emissions, or 9% of global
emissions.
         Emissions from the production of inter-regionally traded goods and services in Brazil
amounted in 36% of the country’s territorial (or production-based) CO2 emissions.
International trade was slightly less relevant to Brazilian emissions than the world average, as
25% of its territorial CO2 emissions were attributed to its exports to foreign countries.

   In this paper, we distinguish between “inflows” / “outflows”, regarding trade among domestic states, and
“imports” / “exports”, regarding trade between states and foreign countries, or between foreign countries.

  In this section, for better presentation, we have aggregated some of the countries in our model as “Other EU27”
(Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland,

        Inter-regional and international trade are more relevant for the generation of global and
Brazil’s CO2 emissions than for value added, which is emphasized comparing the figures for
trade in value added (TiVA). In 2008, 20% of global value added were attributed to
international traded (versus 28% for CO2 emissions). In Brazil, inter-regional trade responded
to 27% of the country’s value added (versus 36% for CO2 emissions). The greater relevance of

3.2. Production-based and consumption-based CO2 emissions

        In order to quantify the emission transfers via inter-regional and international trade, we
rearrange the results of TiCE presented in Table 1. For computing the production-based
emissions, we sum the components “domestic”, “exports (outflows) to Brazilian regions”, and
“exports to foreign countries”. For consumption-based emissions, “domestic”, “imports
(inflows) from Brazilian regions”, and “imports from foreign countries”. The difference
between production-based and consumption-based emissions is defined as “net emission
transfer” via trade (PETERS et al, 2011). Here, we are considering the transfers via
international and inter-regional trade inside Brazil. Thus the net emissions transfer corresponds
to CO2 emissions in each region (state or country) to produce goods and services that are
ultimately consumed in a different region minus the emissions in other regions to produce goods
and services that are ultimately consumed in the first region. Following the sign convention as
for an economic balance of trade, net exports are positive and net imports are negative. The
results are presented in Table 2.
        For the Brazilian states, where emission transfers also happen via inter-regional trade,
out of 27 states seven were sources of net emission transfer to other states or foreign countries.
Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais were outstanding net exporters of CO2 emissions. São Paulo,
the greatest emitter in the country both production and consumption-based, was also the
recipient of the largest net emission transfer. These results are analyzed with further detail in
sub-section 3.4.
        Considering Brazil as a whole, its consumption-based emissions surpassed its
production-based emissions, so that it received net emission transfers via international trade.
This is dissimilar for other BRICs countries, which presented positive net emission transfer via
international trade. Especially China, with net exports emissions amounting in 1.6 Gt CO2.
Concerning the countries included in the Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol and that are treated
individually in our model, each of them (with exception of Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Poland,
and Russia) received net emission transfers via international trade. This finding adds to the
literature about the inadequacy of the territorial principle for mitigation targets under a
fragmented, two-tier mitigation strategy as in Kyoto Protocol (PETERS et al, 2011).
        Table 3 breaks down these results by groups of trade partners (domestic components,
Brazilian states, and foreign countries). It shows there was great variation concerning the
                                                                                                       9

        Among the foreign countries in Table 3, Taiwan is where international trade presented
the most important role in production-based CO2 emissions (52%). Although China was the
largest exporter of CO2 emissions in the world, in this country the internationally traded
                                                                                                11


component was (slightly) less important than in, for example, Germany and Korea, given the
dimension of the Chinese domestic final demand. This observation also applies to the
importance of the internationally traded component of CO2 emissions in the USA, from the
consumption perspective: although they are by far the greatest importer of CO2 emissions, the
internationally traded component is more relevant to the EU countries, for example.

3.3. Intensity of CO2 emissions

        In addition to analyzing the magnitude of production and consumption-based CO2
emissions, for policy purposes it is relevant to assess the intensity of emissions.
        In addition to analyzing the magnitude of production and consumption-based CO2
emissions, for policy purposes it is relevant to assess the intensity of emissions. For production-
based emissions, their intensity can be evaluated by the ratio between the total emissions and
the total value added in a region. The Brazilian economy was less intensive in production-based
CO2 emissions than the world average (0.21 thousand ton of CO2 per US$ million of value
added in 2008) and all the developing countries depicted in Table 4. The other three BRICs,
notably China, presented production-based CO2 intensities much larger than the world average
in 2008.
        For the Brazilian states, it is relevant that São Paulo, the main state in economic terms,
presented an intensity of production-based CO2 emissions that was quite smaller than the
national average (0.15 thousand ton of CO2 per US$ million of value added). On the other hand,
the three highest intensities corresponded to Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and Bahia, in that
order. In Espírito Santo, it was 0.56 thousand ton of CO2 per US$ million of value added, thus
above the world average.
        As for consumption-based CO2 emissions, their intensities can be assessed in per capita
terms. The results are presented in Table 4. Among the 40 countries in our model, per capita
consumption-based CO2 emissions vary from 1.03 ton per person per year (py) for India to
16.54 ton / py for the USA. In Brazil, the lowest intensity corresponded to Alagoas (0.77 ton /
py), while Distrito Federal was the other extreme (4.51 ton / py, above the world average).
        As Peters et al (2011) also observed, the per capita consumption-based CO2 emissions
are strongly correlated with per capita final demand expenditures. Using a regression of log-
transformed data, we derived its elasticity. Considering the countries in our model, CO2
emissions strongly increase with final demand expenditures as can be seem in Figure 3, with
an elasticity ε = 0.63 (R² = 0.84). Therefore, as countries become wealthier its consumption-
based CO2 emissions increase by 63% for each doubling of per capita final demand
expenditure. Since the elasticity is less than one, the intensity of consumption-based CO2
emissions decreases with final demand expenditures.
        Applying this exercise to Brazilian states (Figure 4), we obtained an elasticity ε = 0.87
(R² = 0.86), which is larger than when we consider countries. Thus the increase in consumption-
based CO2 emissions is greater as states become wealthier. However, the intensity of
consumption-based emissions still decreases with final demand expenditures.

3.4. Brazilian states’ inter-regional and international trade in CO2 emissions

        In this sub-section, we analyze with further detail the results for Brazilian states’ TiCE,
since it is relevant for policy purposes to identify and quantify the most important CO2
emissions flows, between each pair of trade partners.
        Table A1, in the Annex, summarizes the inter-regional flows in CO2 emissions, with
aggregation across the 28 industries of our model. An important share of Brazil’s inter-regional
TiCE (23%) took place among the states in the Southeast region. São Paulo is dominant in the
inter-regional trade in CO2 emissions, responding for 22% of outflows and 21% of inflows of
emissions in Brazil. For all the states, São Paulo is the most important source of inter-regional
TiCE and, except for Roraima, Alagoas, and Distrito Federal, it is also the most important
destination. São Paulo’s most important trade partners (in CO2 emission terms) are the other
states in the Southeast region, for which São Paulo sources 37% of its outflows and from which
it acquires 44% of its inflows. The key emission flows from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro and
from Minas Gerais to São Paulo alone amounted respectively in 5% and 4% of Brazil’s inter-
regional TiCE. However, it is noteworthy that comparing this with the results from the TiVA
analysis (DIETZENBACHER et al, 2013) reveals that São Paulo’s dominance is less intense
in terms of emissions – the state responded for the larger share of 37% of outflows in value
added terms. This is because São Paulo presents a low consumption-based CO2 emissions
                                                                                                                  14


intensity, as presented in Table 4. Despite such low intensity, São Paulo’s inter-regional trade
flows (in value added terms) are so large that the state also takes the lead in TiCE.
        On the other hand, Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais are more relevant as sources for
inter-regional TiCE (than for TiVA). This is largely due to the large amounts of CO2 emission
that are generated in their “Mining and Quarrying” and “Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal”
sectors in response to the final demands of other states. For both states, Rio de Janeiro and São
Paulo were the most important destinations of their outflows, concentrating more than 46% of
them.
        In fact, the highest intensity of CO2 corresponds to the flows from Espírito Santo: on
average, for each US$ one million of value added due other states’ final demand, 0.78 thousand
ton of CO2 emissions was produced there (in the whole inter-regional system, the average was
0.28 thousand ton of CO2 emissions / US$ one million of value added). Bahia’s outflows
presented the second highest CO2 intensity, 0.49 thousand ton of CO2 emissions / US$ one
million of value added, quite below Espírito Santo’s.
        From the data in Table A1, we can compute the net emission transfers between the
states. Due to space limitation, here we only describe some of the main results. Espírito Santo
was a source of net emission transfers to every other state in Brazil. Its largest surplus was with
São Paulo (1.9 thousand ton of CO2). Surpluses of TiCE were also verified for Amazonas with
all trade partners in Brazil (except Espírito Santo). The latter result is mainly due to the Free
Trade Zone of Manaus, which comprehends an industrial hub directed to the demand of the rest
of the country. In the case of São Paulo, differently for what was observed considering TiVA
(DIETZENBACHER et al, 2013), when the state presented surpluses with all other states
(except Amazonas), here the sum of its deficits (especially with Espírito Santo and Minas
Gerais) greatly compensates its surpluses in inter-regional trade in CO2 emissions. This results
in its positive net emissions transfer to other states amounting in only 3% of its consumption-
based CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the state that received the largest net emission transfer
via inter-regional trade was Distrito Federal, what is comprehensible given its limited
productive structure and its high final demand expenditures. In 2008, it received 3,610 thousand
tons of CO2 from other states, in net terms (corresponding to 66% of its production-based CO2
emissions).
        The states’ exports and imports in CO2 emissions are respectively detailed by trade
partner in Tables A2 and A38, in the Annex. According to Table A2, the main exporter of CO2
emissions was Minas Gerais (almost 19% of the national exports), which surpassed São Paulo
(about 17% of national exports). Corresponding to approximately 12.5%, Espírito Santo also
stands out. Concerning the exports by trade partners, the largest share (34%) corresponded to
the group of countries “Other + ROW”, being followed by EU 27 (25.2%), USA (18.4%) and
China (8.7%). However, this ranking of trade partners does not hold for every state. For Pará
and Espírito Santo, the USA are more important destination of exports of CO2 than EU27.
        It is interesting that, on average, Brazil’s exports are more intense in CO2 emissions
than its inter-regional flows (0.38 thousand ton of CO2 emissions / US$ one million of exported
value added versus 0.28 in inter-regional trade). As observed for total production-based CO2
emissions and inter-regional outflows, the intensity of Espírito Santo’s exports of CO2
emissions was the highest in Brazil (1.08 thousand ton of CO2 emissions / US$ one million of
exported value added, on average). We observe that the average CO2 intensity varies with the

trade partner. So, in Brazil as whole, USA’s final demand generates a higher CO2 / value added
ratio than China’s or EU27’s (0.44 thousand ton of CO2 emissions / US$ one million of
exported value added versus 0.37).
         São Paulo was largely dominant in the imports in CO2 emissions (31% of national
imports). In fact, the emission transfer of foreign countries to São Paulo greatly surpassed those
via inter-regional trade, i.e. the final demand of São Paulo had a greater impact in CO2
emissions of foreign countries than in other states of Brazil. Thus the main sources of emission
transfer to São Paulo were the group “Other + ROW”, China, EU27, and the USA, before even
the states in Brazilian southeast region. The group “Other + ROW” and China produced the
largest amounts of CO2 emissions in foreign countries due to Brazilian states’ final demand
(34% and 28%, respectively), being followed by EU27 (12%) and the USA (9%).
         Concerning the CO2 intensities of Brazilian states’ imports of CO2 emissions, it is
noticeable that BRICs exports to Brazil presented quite high CO2 / value added ratio. In the
case of China, for example, each US$ one million of exported value added to Brazilian states
embodied 1.46 thousand ton of CO2 emissions. This reflects the high intensity of the
production-based CO2 emissions in these countries, as presented in Table 4.
         Combining the data in Tables A2 and A3, we obtain the net emission transfers relating
Brazilian states and foreign countries. São Paulo received a large net emission transfer from
foreign countries in 2008 (20,046 thousand tons). In fact, from the countries depicted in Tables
A2 and A3, São Paulo presented net imports with all of the (except Mexico, Spain, and France).
On the other hand, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Pará were important net exporters of CO2
emissions to foreign countries. Especially Espírito Santo, which was a source of net emission
transfers amounting in 7,107 thousand tons CO2. Considering the foreign trade partners, the
BRICs and the group “Other + ROW” were sources of net emission transfers to almost every
state in Brazil. China outstands, presenting a total net emission transfer of 23,327 thousand tons
to Brazilian states. On the other hand, the countries from UE27 and the USA were net importers
of CO2 emissions in Brazil as a whole.

4. Concluding Remarks

        The emergence of the global value chains, resulting in many of today’s products and
services being no longer produced within a single country, raises many relevant questions.
Among them, what are the environmental effects of fragmentation of production, including
those with global scale, such as the emission of GHGs? Given the inter-regional fragmentation
of production, these questions also apply at the regional level, and perhaps even to a larger
extent. The present paper aimed to contribute to this discussion, analyzing the CO2 emissions
in the Brazilian states in the context of global and domestic value chains.
        Since the fragmentation of production processes leads to an interdependent structure
which has to be accounted for, the input-output methodology is especially suitable. In our
analysis, we combined a world input-output table with an inter-regional input-output table.
From this we obtained a model covering the interdependence of 27 Brazilian states and 40 other
countries (with the rest of the world as a country) in 2008, with the economic structures and
corresponding CO2 emissions arranged in 28 industries.
        A central finding of our analysis is that, next to 28% of global emissions being embodied
in international trade, 36% of territorial emissions in Brazil were traded between states. Thus,
international and inter-regional trade play an important role in emissions, and thus should be
weighted in the elaboration of climate change policies.
        The quantification of consumption-based emissions produces an alternative indicator to
the territorial principle that guides the mitigation commitments in current international
agreements. However, arguably it goes from an extreme to another, shifting the burden of
                                                                                               16


mitigation entirely from producers (that benefit from economic activity in their territory) to
finals consumers. As an intermediate solution, consumption-based indicators may help
establishing differentiate commitments that are trade-adjusted, adhering to the principle of
“common but differentiated responsibilities”. Also, consumption-based indicators can be used
to identify priority mitigation activities under a “Clean Development Mechanism” in areas that
are source of exports / outflows of CO2 emissions.
        This is not possible under the current framework of subnational climate change policies
in Brazil, which autonomously emerged and are fundamentally detached from each other. Since
to achieve a nation-wide goal of mitigation inter-regional carbon leakage has to be taken into
consideration, coordination among the interlinked economies is fundamental. In fact, a central
arrangement is easier inside countries, than at global level, since the federal government can
design policies gathering the subnational regions.
        Our study indicated many heterogeneities among Brazilian states concerning CO2
emissions. There is great variation on production and consumption-based emission intensities,
as well very different carbon contents in the inter-regional and international trade flows. Such
points should be considered in the design of climate policies and they indicate possible paths
for reducing emissions. For example, the existence of different production-based emission
intensities brings out the possibility of technology transfers as mitigation strategy. The
verification of decreasing consumption-based emissions as states become wealthier leads to
questioning where it is due to better technology, structural change of what is consumed, or some
other factor that can be appropriated by mitigation policies. Identifying the most important
flows in inter-regional trade in emissions can ground environmental agreements between states.
In this way, the present study may contribute to the elaboration of commitments based not only
on political negotiations, but also in scientific and economic analysis.
