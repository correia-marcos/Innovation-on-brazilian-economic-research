ABSTRACT:

This paper investigates the determinants of urban land use for the city of Recife, Brazil. Using a
microdata of 98,198 individual parcels and a locally weighted multinomial logit, we show that there is
considerable local spatial effects, which indicates that parametric approaches may be inadequate in an
intra-urban context. Additionally, some general patterns of land use are identified: transport
infrastructures (which include main avenues, roadways and subway stations) tend to attract commercial
activities, while natural amenities (including the public open areas, the beach and the river) tend to
encourage residential development. Finally, it is evidenced that, on average, the probability of
unimproved lots is higher in areas near the city historical center and the verticalization is greater in areas
near the city center and to the natural amenities.

1. Introduction

        Urban land use plays a key role in urban economics since reflects the allocative decisions of firms
and households (Duranton and Puga, 2015). Firms define their geographical location following the goal
of minimizing costs, while households decide where to live maximizing their utility and considering the
tradeoff between commuting costs and housing consumption. In this way, the spatial distribution of urban
land use is a consequence of interactions that occur between individuals, businesses, environment and
transport systems and the land usually goes to the sector with greater willingness to pay for its use, i.e. the
highest bidder (O`Sullivan, 2012). Understanding the patterns of urban land use is of fundamental
importance, since several urban problems are associated with land use, such as traffic congestion
(Sarzynski et al., 2006, Antipova et al. 2011), violence (Browning et al., 2010, Twinam, 2017, Law et al.,
2015) and the environment deterioration (Arnott et al., 2008). In a practical point of view, to know spatial
distribution of land use is useful to explain the geography of the social life of the city, support the proper
allocation of public services and infrastructure (such as schools, hospitals and roads) and help the
formulation of more efficient urban policies (such as master plans, zoning laws and housing programs).
        In recent decades, the patterns of urban land use of Brazilian cities experienced significant
changes as a direct consequence of the growth of cities and due to intense and quickly urbanization
process. The residential capital stock in Brazil practically doubled in the period from 1990 to 2008, an
increase of 98.3%, well above the real GDP growth in the period of 80.5% (Institute of Applied
Economic Research - IPEA, 2008). The urban space grew horizontally and vertically, although the second
type of expansion with a greater intensity. For example, in 2000 about 56.5% of the population living in
metropolitan regions resided in the central city, as early as 2010, this proportion fell to 54.8%, indicating
a further growth of suburban cities. In relation to verticalization, there was an increase of 11.92% in the
proportion of dwellings classified as apartment buildings from 2000 to 2010, contrasting the 2.68%
decrease in the proportion of dwellings classified as traditional houses. (Brazilian Demographic Census,
2010). It is necessary to recognize that these phenomena are also observed in other Latin American cities
and are related to the rise of gated communities (Borsdorf et al. 2007) and the decentralization of
employment and formation of polycentric structures (Fernández-Maldonado et al. 2013). In addition to
the recent changes in the spatial configuration of cities, another important characteristic of developing
countries is the huge informal housing market. Although the proportion of individuals living in the
informal market has declined over time, it is estimated that 21% of the urban population of the Caribbean
and Latin America regions still live in informal settlements, which represents a population of
approximately 105 million people. (UN-HABITAT, 2016). This strong informality may be a consequence
of several factors, such as the intense rural-urban migration, scarcity of housing supply, income inequality
and rigid land use regulations (Cavalcanti, Da Mata, and Santos 2017).
        Considering the importance of the subject and the recent modifications in the urban configuration
of Brazilian cities, the objective of this paper is to investigate the determinants of urban land use
analyzing the case of Recife, an important Brazilian urban center and the oldest capital of the country.
More specifically, using a novelty micro-data containing information on 98,198 individual lots and
employing a semi-parametric spatial discrete choice model, we will associate the categories of land use
(residential, commercial, residential multifamily, mixed use and unimproved) with different kinds of
urban attributes: accessibility of the lot, the availability of natural amenities, and finally, the local
transport facilities. Our study area is particularly interesting for two reasons: firstly, because the city does
not have a zoning ordinance that restricts the allocation of land for different categories of use and,
secondly, because Recife has natural amenities that generate strong heterogeneities in different spaces.
Empirically, these singular characteristics allow us to investigate whether a competitive market allocation
of land leads to a clear segregation of uses in the urban space and how natural amenities can shape the
city´s spatial configuration.
        There is a wide body of empirical studies related to ours that can be subdivided into three groups.
Firstly, applications include papers that analyzes how works the conversion of forest or agricultural land
to urban use (Carrión-Flores et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013; Chakir and Parent 2009; Chakir and Le Gallo,
2013). Second, studies that investigates the changes of land use in an intra-urban context, attempting to
understand the urban attributes that affect land conversions for residential, commercial or industrial use
(Verburg et al., 2004; Páez, 2006; Braimoh and Onishi, 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Wrenn and Sam, 2014;
Bhat et al., 2015). And finally, the more similar ones to our, that seek to determine the factors that affect
the allocation of land to different urban uses, like commercial, residential, industrial and mixed use
(McMillen and McDonald, 1999; McMillen and Soppelsa, 2015; Jacob and McMillen, 2015). This last
type of research is scarcer, since the most cities have a zoning ordinance that tend to interfere and alter
the allocation of land away from what would be determined by a competitive market, making difficult to
investigate the natural patterns of land use (McDonald, 2006).
        This literature highlights the role of accessibility - commonly measured by proximity to Central
Business District (CBD) - and the role of transport infrastructures for explain the patterns of urban land
use. For example, Páez (2006) found that the implementation of Union City BART station (California)
change the land use in areas close to the new facility. Wang et al. (2011), analyzing the city of Austin
(Texas), evidenced that proximity to CBD encourages offices development but discourage commercial
and industrial development. Additionally, they showed that areas close to major arterial roads tend to
have a greater probability for commercial and industrial conversion. Using a detailed data of 474,190
parcels from Cook County (Illinois), McMillen and Soppelsa (2015) show that residential land use tends
to be smaller in regions close to the CBD, to train lines and to major streets. The availability of natural
amenities and the biophysical quality of the soil are also recognized important variables to explain the
urban land use (Verburg et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2011).
        A common concern of these empirical studies is to develop discrete choice models incorporating
the spatial dependence hypothesis. It is well recognized that patterns of urban land use is strongly
dependent of the neighborhood, i.e., it is undoubtedly a spatial process. The commerce, industry and other
business activities tend to develop together to take advantage of agglomeration economies, either through
input-output linkages, knowledge spillovers, consumption externalities, or labor pooling (Billings and
Johnson 2016). Residential areas also have economies of agglomeration, mainly because they can share
the same public infrastructure, like sewage, telecommunications network and electricity. Considering this,
the more recent studies incorporated the spatial dependence into discrete choice models in two different
ways: through parametric approaches which estimates a global measure of spatial dependence (in line
with Anselin, 1988) and through the application of a semi-parametric approach based on extensions of the
Locally Weight Regression (LWR) and allowing spatial non-stationary relations among the variables. In
the first segment, Chakir and Le Gallo (2013), Wang et al. (2014) and Bhat et al. (2015) found that land
use change has a positive autocorrelation, indicating that conversions to a specific use affect the
conversions of neighboring parcels for the same use. In the side of semi-parametric approaches, Wang et
al. (2011), Wrenn and Sam (2014) and McMillen and Soppelsa (2015) show that although there is a huge
spatial variation in the magnitude of factors that affect the allocation of lots to different uses within a
particular city, parcels that are geographically close tend to develop very similarly.
         At this point, it should be noted that most empirical studies are conducted for North American
cities and therefore very little is known about the determinants of urban land use in the developing world.
The existing evidence indicates that the patterns of land use are sensitive to distinct institutional contexts,
perhaps because of the different urbanization levels between countries. For example, for Lagos (Nigeria),
Braimoh and Onishi (2007) found that residential development tends to be larger in areas close to the
Central Business District (CBD), while McMillen and Soppelsa (2015) show just the opposite. In
addition, much of the previous literature has prioritized the theoretical development of spatial discrete
choice models, neglecting the empirical investigation of land use determinants. This created a large gap
between methodological advances and empirical land use analyzes. Therefore, given the recent changes in
the spatial configuration of cities in developing countries - mainly the increased urban sprawl, the
verticalization and the huge informal housing market - and the lack of empirical studies analyzing urban
land use in these countries, it is extremely important to develop new research in the area.
        We intend to contribute in this sense, analyzing the determinants of land use for the case of
Recife, a large Brazilian metropolis. As Recife has similar urban trends to other Latin American cities and
the spatial distribution of land use is market oriented, we believed that, with some care, the results can be
expanded to other cities of the developing world. Our paper also innovates when analyzing the factors
that affect the allocation of land for tall buildings and for unimproved lots, contributing to the literature
on determinants of verticalization (Barr, 2010, Ahlfeldt and McMillen, 2017) and to studies that analyze
the vacancy rates (Morandé et al., 2010; Nadalin and Igliori, 2016). Despite the strong increase in
verticalization in Brazil, the empirical evidence about its determinants is practically non-existent.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we discuss the main theoretical
predictions regarding urban land use, in section 3 we briefly present the urban trends and characteristics
of Recife and describe the database, section 4 shows details of the empirical strategy, section 5 presents
the results and the discussion, section 6 presents some aspects related to the predictive capacity of the
empirical models, and finally, section 7 presents the final remarks.


2. Theoretical Background: the landowner decision and the bid-rent functions
        The patterns of urban land use are determined by economic interactions between the landowner
and the different sectors of the urban economy (housing, manufacturing, commerce, offices and others).
From the landowner perspective, he is confronted with the decision to allocate parcels of land - with
constant quality and size - for different categories of use. In addition, it is assumed that the landowner is
risk-neutral and has the objective of maximize the present discounted value of all rental flows of land
parcels. Considering these assumptions, the decision rule that stems from a dynamic optimization
problem (described in detail, for example, by Lubowski, 2002) is to choose, in each period of time , the
land use that generates the highest net return. The net return on land in use is equal to the return
generated by the parcel of land allocated in use minus the potential opportunity cost of conversion. is
an element of the total set of different land uses, denoted by                . A landowner with land in use
will choose the use at time that satisfies:



Where        represents the expected return of the land in use at time , is the discount rate and         is the
expected marginal cost of convert land in use to use at time . Therefore, the landowner's optimal
decision is to convert the land in use to the use if the return of the second category exceeds the return
of the first category (after deducting the conversion costs), not convert if the return in use exceeds the
return in use k, and finally, the landowner can be indifferent between the different categories of land use.
The description of the landowner's behavior is useful to illustrate one of the main results of the urban
economy: the land goes to the urban sector with greater willingness to pay for its use, or, in other words,
the highest bidder (Fujita, 1989; O`Sullivan, 2012). Usually, the amount the sectors are willing to pay for
land is called bid rent.
        The bid-rent is a function of several factors, ranging from the biophysical quality of the soil, to the
availability of transport infrastructure and other public goods. Considering the close link between bid-rent
and land use, in the present paper, we will associate the categories of land use with three different types of
urban attributes: the degree of accessibility of the lot (measured as the distance to the CBD), the
proximity to transport facilities and, finally, the availability of natural amenities.
        About the first aspect, the traditional Alonso-Muth-Mills model (Alonso, 1964; Muth, 1969; Mills,
1972) is useful to predict how the land will be allocated in different regions of the same urban area. One
of the main conclusions of the model is to show that in equilibrium, the price of land decreases according
to the distance from the CBD (Brueckner, 1987). As a consequence, when deciding where to live,
households face a trade-off between consuming more housing (living farther from the CBD) or getting
closer to the workplace and reduce the commuting costs (living closer from the CBD). That is, residential
development in areas close to the CBD is encouraged by accessibility and, on the other hand, discouraged
by higher land prices. The willingness to sacrifice accessibility for space is heterogeneous among
different households and varies according to income (Duranton and Puga, 2015). In addition, because
land is more expensive in areas close to the CBD, house builders choose to replace land by more capital
and thus produce taller buildings (Fujita and Thisse, 2013; Ahlfeldt and McMillen, 2017). In relation to
business - such as commerce, industrial activities and offices – these tend to benefit from proximity to the
CBD, due to potential agglomeration gains.
         Transport infrastructures also play a key role in determining the patterns of urban land use. As
described by McDonald (2006), a new transportation project changes the bid-rent of agents to match the
savings in transport costs, and, consequently, affect the allocation of land to different uses. Firstly, the
business sector is strongly benefited by the proximity of transport infrastructures: it facilitates the goods
flow, reduces the freight costs, and improves access to the consumer market (O`Sullivan, 2012). Thus, the
bid-rent for commercial or industrial uses is expected to be greater in places closer to the transport
facilities, since these areas tend to be more profitable. In a recent paper, Billings and Johnson (2016)
show that proximity to transport infrastructures explain a great part of the industrial agglomeration in
Denver-Boulder-Greeley CMSA. In relation to the effects on residential land use, the transport proximity
can increase or decrease the bid-rent of households. Easier access to transport infrastructures has the
benefit of reducing costs related to commuting, improving access to amenities and public services and
reducing the shop trips distance (McDonald, 2006). However, in areas very near to infrastructures, a
reduction in the bid-rent may occur, due to the predominance of negative externalities such as congestion,
pollution and noise. The bid-rent function for mixed land use behaves in a very particular way. Mixed
land use is a response to situations where commuting costs are relatively high and agglomeration forces
are low (Wheaton, 2004, Fujita and Thisse, 2013). Under these circumstances, the firms tend to locate
more disperse and households are incentivized to work near of their residences, encouraging mixed use
conversions. Thus, is expected that mixed use be associated with locations more distant from transport
facilities and with the peripheral area of the city (in relation to CBD), where the capacity for
agglomeration gains is limited.
         It’s also necessary to consider the role of environmental quality in household and business
locational decisions. In this sense, Cho (2001) and Brueckner et al. (1999) expanded the Alonso-Muth-
Mills model by incorporating the availability of natural amenities into the utility function of households.
In the residential sector, is expected that bid-rent will be greater in places close to natural amenities. In
such places, families benefit from having access to a more beautiful view, a cleaner air or more leisure
and recreational options. However, with the only exception of specific sectors such as touristic and
gastronomic, firms are not directly benefited by having a localization closer to natural amenities, and,
therefore do not tend to have a greater bid-rent in areas with good environmental quality.
         In summary, the theoretical results points that the degree of lot centrality and the proximity to
transport infrastructures tends to increase the bid-rent of the business sector and generate an inconclusive
effect on the households bid-rent (which will depend on the preferences of each of them). Areas close to
the CBD also tend to have taller buildings and a smaller proportion of mixed land use. On the other hand,
the household’s willingness to pay for land use tends to increase in the vicinity of natural amenities, while
the bid-rent of the business sector is only affected by this attribute in very particular cases.

3. Context and Data
3.1 Urban characteristics of the study area

        Our study area comprises the municipality of Recife, the main city of the Metropolitan Region of
Recife (RMR) and the capital of Pernambuco state. The RMR is one of the main urban agglomerations in
Brazil, being the richest metropolis of the North and Northeast regions (with a GDP of R$ 75.8 billion,
according to Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 2015) and the eighth richest in the country.
The metropolitan region has a population of about 3.94 million of residents and Recife concentrates
41.2% of this contingent.
        In recent decades, the city has undergone strong modifications in its urban structure, and, like
other Latin American cities, it experienced processes of intense verticalization, urban sprawl and
economic decentralization in relation to its historical center. As shown by Silveira-Neto (2016), in the
period from 1991 to 2000, the districts closer to the Recife center grew by an average of 5.5% while the
peripheral districts grew by 19.9%. This tendency of sprawl was attenuated in the most recent period
(2000 to 2010), where both areas grew by about 8%. However, despite being an old city (founded in
1537) and having experienced some urban sprawl and employment decentralization, Recife remains with
an eminently monocentric structure. In a recent paper, Belmiro et al. (2017) identified the centers and
sub-centers of Recife and showed that the peaks in employment density are concentrated in a single
region that is located in the intermediations of the historic center of the city, indicating the presence of a
monocentric pattern. The authors also show that there is a negative and convex relationship between
density and distance to the CBD, which reinforces the monocentric structure of Recife and confirm the
Alonso-Muth-Mills model predictions.
         Although the urban sprawl has been limited, the city grew to the sky: from 2000 to 2010, there
was a 14.5% increase in the proportion of dwellings located in apartment buildings (Brazilian
Demographic Census, 2010). The more vertical growth of the city is a consequence of two factors: the
lack of urban infrastructure in peripheral regions (such as sewage), which inhibits the land use in
suburban areas and, in second place, the higher income and the massive housing subsides, which have led
to increases in demand for areas with good infrastructure and closer to the city center (Silveira-Neto,
2016). Both factors valorized the land located in the qualified areas, encouraging the exchange of land by
capital and, thus, the construction of taller buildings. In addition to these factors, the zoning code may
also have facilitated the recent verticalization of Recife.
         Unlike major cities such as São Paulo and Brasilia, the land-use legislation of Recife2 does not
impose any type of direct constraint on the allocation of land to particular uses. For example, there are no
legal divisions between residential and commercial areas. The zoning code of the city is characterized by
restricting only the intensity of use (through maximum floor-area ratios and height limits) and the land-
use in areas of environmental protection, of social interest and near of historical and cultural buildings.
For this reason, the urban planning legislation is criticized as being very permissible for any kind of
prejudice and adverse land use (Medina, 1997). In this way, the market interactions, rather than a
government planner, determine the great part of the spatial distribution of land use in the city.

3.2 Data

        Considering the purpose of explaining the factors that are associated with a particular urban land-
use, we will adopt a novelty and official database that contains information of 98,198 individual lots in
the city of Recife. This includes all parcels with property rights, leaving aside the informal ones. The
database contains the following variables: area, geographical coordinates, land status (active or
unimproved), number of floors, year of building construction and the form of land use. The database was
updated in 2013, and is built by the local government through the Geographic Information System of
Recife (RESIG). Initially, the parcels are divided into the following categories of land-use: Commercial3
(7.78%), Industrial (0.24%), Mixed Use (0.98%), Residential (70.52%), Residential - Multifamily
(6.69%), Unimproved (11.27%) and Special Classes (2.49%). Mixed use refers to lots that cover
simultaneously residences and business activities. The last type of land use refers to schools, hospitals,
religious temples, public buildings and other unrecorded institutions. For descriptive purposes, Figure 1
shows the spatial distribution of lots by categories of land use.
        Although a simple visual inspection does not reveal specific patterns, the following general
characteristics can be observed in the Figure 1: the predominance of multifamily residential lots on the
seashore, the existence of residential agglomerations in the suburban areas, and the concentration of
commercial activities in the vicinity of the CBD. Additionally, it is noteworthy that there are few lots
with industrial and mixed use. The first fact is that Recife is a predominantly service-oriented city, with
around 85% of GDP originated from this activity (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 2015).
The industrial plants of the Metropolitan Region are located in other municipalities, excluded from our
study area. Low mixed use can be a consequence of the high agglomeration forces that exist in the city -

2
  The land-use legislation of Recife comprises the following ordinances: Law 16,176/1996, Law 16,719/2001 and Law
17,511/2008.
3
  This category includes a wide range of private business activities: retail stores, offices, parking’s, gas stations, financial
institutions, hotels and others.
since Recife remains with a strong monocentric structure - and by the lack of urban planning tradition that
values mixed land use.

The explanatory variables were constructed with a geographic information system (GIS) program that
allows calculating the distance in relation to each particular lot. Initially, we had taken as CBD the
traditional historical center of Recife, known as Marco Zero or Rio Branco square. According to official
records, this place is considered the starting point of Recife. As shown by Belmiro et al. (2017), the city's
employment density peak are localized in the vicinity of the historic center and, in addition, about 59.75%
of all commercial parcels of the city are located within a radius of 5km. In relation to transport variables,
we included in our analysis the distance (in meters) in relation to the three major infrastructures of the
city: the subway stations, the main avenues4 and the roadways. Finally, the natural amenities include the
Capibaribe River, the beach and the main public open spaces5. Table 1 describes the summary statistics
of explanatory variables.

 We chose the main avenues as being those classified as arterial routes by the city's transit agency. In appendix (available
upon request to authors), we list these main avenues.

  We use only the thirty largest open spaces in the city, which includes parks, squares and green areas. In appendix, we list
these areas.

4. Empirical Strategy: the Locally Weighted Regression
        As a way to associate the categories of land use with different urban attributes, we will apply a
non-parametric strategy of spatial modeling: the locally weighted regression (LWR). This approach is
useful in an intra-urban context, to understand non-linear relationships and to allow spatial heterogeneity
between the estimated coefficients. In the study of urban land use, it is very common that the relationships
between the variables are different in each particular geographical area. For example, as discussed in
subsection 2.2, residential development may be both attracted and driven away by proximity to
transportation infrastructures. Locations very close to transport facilities tend to be more crowded,
polluted and noisy, which discourages residential land use. However, locations relatively more distant
(but still close) tend to attract families who wish to benefit from greater accessibility provided by
transport facilities. When recognized that there is a significantly spatial variation in a particular
phenomenon, a common practice in applied econometrics is to estimate different functions for different
geographical areas. The LWR simply formalize this heuristic approach (McMillen and McDonald, 2004).
        Through the LWR is possible to get different coefficients for each particular observation. Thus,
unlike the traditional parametric techniques, the method allows spatial non-stationary. The usual
procedure for estimation is the repetition of weighted least squares for each observation. However, in the
case of discrete dependent variables, the estimation method involves the maximization of likelihood
functions (Tibshirani and Hastie, 1987). In this paper, as we are interested in understanding the
determinants of urban land use, the dependent variable will be discrete with        categories. In this way,
like McMillen and McDonald (1999) and Wang et al. (2011), we apply a non-parametric multinomial
logit. Considering there are categories of land use, the local estimates are obtained by maximizing the
following pseudo log-likelihood function for each observation:




Where      is an indicator variable that takes one when the category                      is chosen and takes zero,
otherwise. The term        is the probability of choosing the alternative                 and, is defined as follows
(normalizing the base alternative to zero):




In equation (3), the term is a vector of explanatory variables that have potential to affect the urban
land use, and      is the associated vector of coefficients. The maximization of the equation (2) produces
  distinct estimates of the vectors             for each category of land use , which we denote by
        Before maximize the equation (2), it is necessary to establish a way of associating observations
that are spatially close in order to obtain the spatial weights,   . This is done through a Kernel weighting
function, which having as input the geographical coordinates of and , generates the spatial weight            .
This type of non-parametric process follows the most fundamental law of spatial econometrics: the
shorter the distance between and , the greater will be the weight given to these points. A range of kernel
functions can be arbitrarily used at this stage. For example, a function that is widely used is the tri-cube:



Where       is the Euclidean distance between point and point (based on geographical coordinates),
is the distance between and the Q-th nearest neighbor and                      is an indicator function that
equals one only when the condition is satisfied. Thus, this function put zero weight in the points that have
a distance to the target point higher than the Q-th neighbor and put a non-zero weight that decreases
with the distance to those points that are below the threshold. The number is called the window size of
the kernel function and is conceptually similar to the bandwidth parameter found in other kinds of kernel
functions, these parameters determine how fast the weights decrease with the distance (McMillen and
McDonald, 2004). Although the choice of kernel function is not sensible, the choice of the window size
or bandwidth is critical to the estimation process (Wheeler and Paéz, 2010). Usually, the choice of these
parameters can be made based on an interactive method of Cross-Validation (CV), through the maximum
value of the log likelihood function or based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
        Finally, it is important to note that the estimated vector of          does not correspond to the
marginal effects of an increase of an explanatory variable on the probability of selecting alternative .
In a multinomial logit approach, the marginal effects are given by (Croissant, 2011 ):




The second term of the expression in brackets represents the weighted average of the coefficients for all
alternatives. The weights are the probabilities of choosing these alternatives. From the above expression,
it is clear that the signal of the estimated coefficients may differ from the signal of the corresponding
marginal effects.
5. Results and Discussion
        In this section, we will present the results of the estimation of our land use model and discuss the
key findings, comparing them to the theoretical predictions and to other empirical studies. In this way,
subsection 5.1 briefly presents the results of the parametric multinomial logit and subsection 5.2 shows
the results of the locally weighted estimation.

5.1 Standard Multinomial Logit Estimates

        Initially, we chose to use five categories of land use in the empirical model: unimproved,
residential, commercial, multifamily residential and mixed use. These categories correspond to 97.51% of
the total number of observations. We opt to merge the industrial category with commercial ones, since the
number of industrial parcels is not very representative (only 0.24% of total) and most of the manufactures
in Recife is of light aspect, resembling commercial establishments. The parcels classified as “Special
Classes” were not employed in the estimation, since they are characterized by generic uses and, in most
cases, are not subject to market rules (such as public buildings, hospitals and churches). Thus, Table 2
presents the marginal effects of the multinomial logit model with five categories of urban land use.
Additionally, the results of the estimated coefficients (with unimproved use normalized to zero, as a base
category) are available in table 3A of the Appendix. The model was estimated by the maximum
likelihood method and all the explanatory variables are in logarithmic format. Each column of Table 2
represents a specific category.
        The figures in Table 2 indicate that the greater the distance to the Central Business District (CBD),
the greater the probability of unimproved parcels, and the lower the likelihood of commercial, mixed use
and residential land use. That is, both households and businesses are attracted by the degree of lot
centrality. More specifically, a 1% increase in lot distance to CBD reduces the probability of residential
use by 5.76% and reduces de probability of commercial use by 8.59%. However, the use of lots for
apartment buildings is positively affected by distance to the CBD, a counterintuitive result in face to the
urban economy theory, as discussed in subsection 2.2. In relation to transport infrastructures (main
avenues, highways and subway stations), we note that mixed use and commercial activity is attracted by
these facilities, while residential is discouraged. The residential multifamily use is more common near
main avenues and to roadways, which may be a consequence of the high land value in these places that
incentive capital-intensive buildings.
        The numbers of column (5) indicates that mixed use is more frequent in the proximity of the CBD
and transport facilities, like the commercial parcels. Although this result is counterintuitive in relation to
the theoretical motivation for mixed use (low agglomeration forces and high commuting costs), this
suggests that the commercial side of mixed use is more preponderant than the residential side in
determining the geographical location of the lot. Regarding natural amenities, a variety of patterns are
observed: open areas (which include parks, green areas and squares) attract both types of residential use.
However, the beach and the river proximity encourages commercial use, multifamily residential, mixed
use and the unimproved of lots.

        Like the traditional regression framework, a shortcoming of the parametric multinomial logit is
that the estimated parameters represent only the mean values. Thus, the estimation process implicitly
assumes that all parcels of the city are affected in the same manner by the different urban attributes,
regardless of their geographical location. That is, it imposes a single parametric and linear specification to
explain all local relations. This approach is too restrictive in an intra-urban context, where it is feasible
that there is strong spatial variation (McMillen and McDonald, 2004; Wang et al., 2011). In the next
subsection, we will present the locally weighted multinomial logit estimation, a less arbitrary approach
that allows parameters to vary smoothly in the space.

5.2 LW Multinomial Logit Estimates

        In order to obtain a set of coefficients for each particular observation, we estimate a Locally
Weighted Multinomial Logit model through the log likelihood function given by (2). We used a tri-cube
kernel weight function and, based on the Cross-Validation method, we chose a 40 percent Window Size.
In addition, like McMillen and Soppelsa (2015), we employ the adaptive decision tree approach (Loader,
1999) to estimate the model in a smaller number of target points, which significantly reduces the
estimation time. Thus, Figure 2 shows the Kernel density functions of the distribution of estimated
coefficients, considering the unimproved use as the base category.
        Initially, Figure 2 shows a strong heterogeneity in the estimated coefficients, so that in most
distributions, there are both positive and negative values. For example, it is noted that proximity to the
CBD may attract or displace any category of land use, indicating that urban areas are much more complex
than the relationships established in the monocentric model. In this sense, there are few situations where
each specific Kernel density contains only coefficients with a common signal. One such case is the
distribution of the coefficients related to the main avenues and to commercial land use (density “J”),
where all coefficients assume negative values. This reveals that proximity to major avenues encourages
commercial use in all parcels of the city, without exception. Furthermore, almost all the coefficients that
measure the relationship between public open areas and residential land use (both single and multifamily,
density “E” and “S”) have a negative sign, reveling that this type of amenity strongly support the
residential development.
        Another interesting aspect of the Kernel densities of Figure 2 is that in each of them there is a
limited set of parcels that develop similarly among each other but diverges from the complete set, which
generates the shape with peaks and valleys. For example, we observe that the distribution of coefficients
related to proximity to the beach (density “U”) indicates that this natural amenity strongly encourages
some parcels for multifamily use (the magnitude of the coefficients reaches up to -24.5) but exerts little or
no influence in the large part of the lots used for this purpose.
        In order to facilitate interpretation of the results and to identify a general pattern of urban land use,
Table 3 presents the mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum of the marginal effects associated
with each coefficients6.

  Before interpreting the results of Table 3, noted that, unlike the parametric models, it is not clear how to get an aggregate
measure of statistical tests for the average marginal effects. Issues regarding statistical inference still need to be improved by
the theoretical LWR literature.

Note: The model is estimated by the locally weighted maximum likelihood using a 422 target points and a tri-cube kernel function with a 40 percent window size. The number of
observations is 95,708. The outcome variables are the categories of urban land use: Unimproved, Residential, Commercial, Residential – Multifamily and Mixed Use. Where the
Unimproved use is defined as the base category. All the explanatory variables are in logarithm format. The blue distribution represents the coefficients associated to residential land
use, the yellow represents the coefficient associated to commercial land use, the green represents the coefficients associated to residential multifamily use, and the red distribution,
those related to the mixed use.

function with a 40 percent window size. The number of observations is 95,708. The outcome variables are the categories of
urban land use: Unimproved, Residential, Commercial, Residential – Multifamily and Mixed Use. All the explanatory
variables are in logarithm format. The standard deviations are in parentheses and the minimum and maximum are in
brackets.

        From Table 3, it can be observed that the greater the distance to the CBD, the smaller - on average
- the probability of the unimproved land. This indicates that there is, in some way, a concentration of
empty or vacant spaces near the city historical center. Nadalin and Igliori (2016) found a very similar
result for the case of São Paulo. According to the authors, a feasible explanation for the proliferation of
empty uses in the historic center is that the place has lost some of its attractiveness as the city became
more polycentric and thus began to receive a smaller share of public investments. In addition, in these
places, there is a greater incentive for landowners to wait for higher prices rather than sell or rent their
properties, since any investment in renewing the historic center tends to prompt rapid local gentrification
(Brueckner and Rosenthal, 2009). In relation to column (2) and (3), it can be identified that although CBD
can both attract and displace commercial and residential land use, commercial development tends to be
higher in areas close to the center (negative mean), while the residential use tends to be lower in these
areas (positive mean). The strong variability of the marginal effects associated with residential use
(ranging from -4.42 to 9.87) indicates that in fact, households have heterogeneous preferences regarding
the accessibility-space choice (Duranton and Puga, 2015). Column (4) of Table 3 shows that, on average,
the probability of land use for apartment buildings is negatively correlated with distance to CBD, a result
predicted by urban economics theory. Locations closer to the city center tend to have more expensive
lands, which encourages capital intensive (rather than land intensive) constructions (Fujita, 1989; Ahlfeldt
and McMillen, 2017). Mixed land use also tends to occur near the CBD (column 5), although there are
parcels that are positively influenced. This result may be explained by the fact that a great part of the
buildings of the historical center of Recife were constructed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a
period characterized by high commuting costs and by a public administration that employed urban
planning traditions that prioritized the mixed land use. The historical characteristic of the city ends up
offsetting the agglomeration forces that exist in the center that could incentives the conversion of mixed
uses to purely commercial uses. This evidence is similar to that of McMillen and McDonald (1999), who
analyzed the city of Chicago in 1920 and showed that mixed use was more common near the CBD and
near the commuter train stations.
        In relation to transport infrastructures, Table 3 presents a series of interesting results. Firstly, the
proximity to the roadways and main avenues affects very similarly the different categories of land use. On
average, these facilities attract the business sector and deviate households (both standard and multifamily
residences). Similarity to Figure 2, there are no cases where the proximity of the main avenues
discourages commercial use, since the marginal effects only assume negative or zero values (ranging
from -0.22 to 0). As discussed earlier, roadways and avenues are key variables for the locational choice of
firms, since these infrastructures facilitate the products flow, the commuting of employees and allow
easier access to the consumer market (O`Sullivan, 2012, Billings and Johnson, 2016). That is, these
infrastructures attract large population flows and generate agglomerative gains. The empirical literature of
urban land use also points out that the greater proximity to roadways, freeways, highways and main
avenues encourage the commercial and industrial development (Braimoh and Onishi, 2007; Wang et al.,
2011; Jacob and McMillen, 2015). From column (1), we observe that parcels distant from these transport
infrastructures tend to have a greater probability of unimproved. From column (5), we note that mixed use
is more common near these facilities, reinforcing the idea that the commercial side of mixed use is more
decisive than the residential side for determining the geographical location of the lot. In relation to
residential sector, the results of column (2) and column (4) indicate that, on average, households choose
to live in areas further away from roadways and main avenues, an indication that negative externalities
(noise, pollution and crowding) overlap the benefits related to greater accessibility.
        To understand better this effect, Figure 3 plot the correlation between the distance to the main
avenues and the corresponding marginal effects of residential use (each point corresponds to a particular
lot). Note that there is a strong non-linearity: as the distance from the avenues increases, the marginal
effects decrease and reach negative values, indicating that the households begin to appreciate these
transportation facilities. This behavior is consistent with the idea that the negative externalities generated
by the main avenues are only concentrated in parcels very close to this infrastructure and support the
empirical studies showing that local residents are commonly opposed to the installation of transport
infrastructures in their immediate proximity (Ahlfeldt and Maennig, 2015).
        The subway stations also tends to discourage land use for residential purposes, since the average
marginal effect assumes a positive value. Like above, this can be a consequence of negative externalities
generated by the subway, especially noise, which is intensified because the train track of the city is not
underground. Additionally, this explanation is in accordance with the study of Seabra et al. (2016), which
shows that proximity to subway reduces the housing prices in Recife. Column (3) and (5) reveals that
subway closeness increases the probability of commercial activities and mixed uses, a result well
expected, since the subway station attracts a large influx of potential consumers.
        The last three lines of table 3 shows the relations between natural amenities (public open areas,
Capibaribe River and the Beach) and the five land use categories. Looking at the average marginal effect,
a general result is easily identified: all three amenities tend to attract the residential sector and discourage
commercial activities and the unimproved of lots. The only counterintuitive result is that the beach
reduces – on the average - the probability of residential multifamily use. A simple visual inspection of the
city's seashore reveals that it is replete of apartment’s buildings (Figure 1). The large variability of the
marginal effects (ranging from -1.9 to 9.71) and the fact that the seashore concentrates only a small
proportion of the total number of apartments in the city can explains this result. Anyway, these evidences
ratifies the urban economic theory that point to natural amenities as key factor for the households
locational choices, influencing the spatial allocation of land use in cities (Brueckner et al., 1999). In
addition, the empirical literature of urban land use finds similar results to ours. For example, Braimoh and
Onishi (2007) show that residential development tends to be closer to water bodies, and McMillen and
Soppelsa (2015) finds that proximity to parks and to Lake Michigan increases the probability of
residential land use. The hedonic prices applications also evidenced the importance of natural amenities:
Seabra et al. (2016) shows that the proximity to Capibaribe River and to the Beach appreciate the price of
housings in Recife.

                  Note: The Marginal Effects were extracted from the specification described in Table
                  3, the distance to main avenues are in logarithm format and each point corresponds
                  to a particular lot. The blue line corresponds to the regression line.

To conclude, the figures in Table 3 show a general pattern of urban land-use: while transport
infrastructures are critical to business activity, the natural amenities play a key role in the attraction of
residential sector. Note that these results diverge from the estimations of Table 2, showing that is
extremely important to consider the wide local coefficient variation and the respective non-linearities. In
the next section, we will analyze the predictive capacity of the empirical models.

6. Model Predictive Performance

        In order to evaluate and compare the predictive performances of the parametric and the locally
weighted Multinomial Logit, Table 4 shows the land use predictions of both approaches, comparing them
with the actual land use. As a starting point, the first number of each cell in the table shows the
predictions constructed under the assumption of randomly land use, using the sample proportions.
For example, note that 11074 of the lots are unimproved, representing 11.57% of the total, so if we
randomly predict the land uses, we would predict that 0.1157 x 69250 = 8012.6 of the truly residential
parcels are unimproved. The second number of each cell presents the prediction of the standard
multinomial logit and the third number shows the prediction obtained with the LW multinomial logit.
Thus, from the first cell, it can be observed that the parametric model accurately predict 851 unimproved
parcels, while the non-parametric model correctly predict 1947 of these. The diagonal elements are of
greater interest, since they represent the number of correct predictions of each particular empirical model.

Note: The first number of each cell presents the random prediction (based in sample proportions), followed by the parametric
prediction and LWR predictions.

Thus, the diagonal numbers of Table 4 reveals that the LW Multinomial Logit has a better predictive
capacity compared to the other two approaches, since it can predict correctly a greater amount of parcels,
with the exception of residential land use. The best predictive performance of the locally weighted models
is also evidenced in other studies (For example, in McMillen and McDonald, 2004). The numbers of
Table 4 reveals that it is extremely difficult to predict the allocation of land for mixed use with the
empirical models, which may be a consequence of the low proportion of lots in this category (only 1% of
the total).

7. Conclusions

        In last decades, the Latin American cities experienced intense modifications in their spatial
configurations, including the increase of verticalization, urban sprawl, slum formation and the formation
of polycentric structures. Faced with these new tendencies and in response to urban problems, public
policies towards cities started to gain greater priority from central governments. In the Brazilian case,
several policies were adopted, including the creation of a federal law that establishes general guidelines
for subdivision of lots and zoning (Federal Law 6,766/79), the creation of the Ministry of Cities in 2003
and the implementation of a housing subsidies policy of approximately R$ 34 billion.
        In this context of cities growth and greater awareness of urban challenges, it becomes important to
understand how work the interactions between households, business and the urban space. Thus, the
objective of this paper was to explain the patterns of urban land use for the city of Recife, a large
Brazilian metropolis. More specifically, with a novelty microdata of 98,198 individual lots, we
investigated the role of transport infrastructures, lot centrality and the availability of natural amenities on
the explanation of different categories of urban land use. Note that like other cities in developing
countries, Recife has a large informal housing market. This makes our exercise particularly interesting
since it allows us to understand to what extent the competitive market is able to explain the allocation of
land use in a heavily informal city.
        Through a locally weighted Multinomial Logit, we detected that there are considerable local
spatial effects, indicating that parametric approaches are inadequate to explain land use in an intra-urban
context. Additionally, we also noted that the LWR approach has a better predictive performance
compared to parametric counterpart. Although there are significant local spatial variations, we identified
some general patterns of land use: transport infrastructures (which include main avenues, roadways and
subway stations) tend to attract commercial use, while natural amenities (including the public open
spaces, the beach and the river) tend to encourage residential development. In addition, our results
indicate that the probability of unimproved is greater in areas further away from natural amenities and
transport facilities and in areas close to the CBD. It has also been shown that, on average, verticalization
is greater in areas close to the CBD and to natural amenities. Although is completely expected that the
intensity of use be higher in more valuated areas, the proliferation of uses that generate negative
externalities (such as multifamily residences) near rivers and the seashore indicates that the zoning
ordinances of the city was ineffective in encouraging the private internalization of these externalities.
Finally, another interesting result is that mixed use occurs in areas near transportation facilities and the
CBD, indicating that the commercial side of mixed use is more decisive than the residential side for
determining the geographical location of the lot.
        In general, our results indicate that the patterns of urban land use in Recife do not differ
significantly from those of North American cities (McMillen and Soppelsa, 2015; Wang et al., 2011), and
that a great part of the theoretical conclusions of urban economics are empirically corroborated. In
practical terms, our results can be useful to improve the city urban planning and help to formulate public
policies for urban land. Firstly, the choice of locations for the implementation of social housing programs
should prioritize areas that have a natural vocation for residential development. The definition of urban
zoning must also respect the equilibrium obtained through the competitive market - which generates a
clear segregation of uses - in order to avoid conflicts and the increase of unimproved parcels. In addition,
the decision to build transport infrastructures should also consider the potential changes in land use of the
vicinity areas. Finally, the high number of vacant lots in the city (especially in the historic center)
indicates that there is still a gap for urban growth, without the need to increase verticalization or sprawl.
